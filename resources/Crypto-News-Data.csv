0,Goldman Sachs Executes Bank's First OTC Crypto Transaction Trading a Bitcoin Non-Deliverable Option,"Mar 21, 2022","On Monday, the multinational investment bank and financial services company Goldman Sachs disclosed it has conducted an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto transaction with the digital currency firm Galaxy Digital. Following the OTC settlement, the head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs’ Asia Pacific unit, Max Minton, said the firm was pleased to have executed the bank’s “first cash-settled cryptocurrency options trade with Galaxy.”According to a few reports and a press release, the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has completed an over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trade with Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz in January 2018. Both firms are calling the transfer “a first-of-its-kind transaction by a major U.S. bank.”Essentially, the bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executed the first OTC crypto transaction in the form of a bitcoin non-deliverable option (NDO). Goldman Sachs and Galaxy have further detailed in the announcement that both companies have had an ongoing partnership. Galaxy notes that the OTC settlement is a “continuation of the bank’s partnership with Galaxy Digital to deepen its crypto capabilities.”Goldman Sachs has had an interesting relationship with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology over the years. In January, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that his perspective on cryptocurrency is evolving. Not too long after Blankfein’s commentary, Goldman Sachs’ analysts warned that bitcoin (BTC) was susceptible to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.As far as the OTC crypto settlement operation with Galaxy, Goldman executive Max Minton says the executed transaction is a milestone. In a press statement Minton said:This is an important development in our digital assets capabilities and for the broader evolution of the asset class.The announcement notes that Galaxy helped Goldman Sachs facilitate its first CME Group Inc. Bitcoin Futures transaction last year. Galaxy’s founder, Mike Novogratz, is a firm believer in the crypto economy, and in an interview published on Tuesday, he said: “bitcoin is a lifeline to people in countries with really poor stewardship of the economy.” Damien Vanderwilt, co-president and head of global markets at Galaxy Digital, thinks the transaction with Goldman Sachs will open new doors.“[We] expect the transaction to open the door for other banks considering OTC as a conduit for trading digital assets,” Vanderwilt said in a statement. “Goldman’s continuing trust in us is a testament to Galaxy’s expertise and ability to meet the evolving demands by institutions as crypto solidifies itself as the fifth asset class.”What do you think about Galaxy Digital and Goldman Sachs completing an OTC crypto transaction trading a bitcoin NDO?

Bitcoin was also consolidating, as it continued to trade above $41,000 during Monday’s session.Despite a selloff to end last week, prices of BTC continued to hover above $41,000 on Monday, as market bulls appear to still be holding onto their positions.Following a low of $40,668.04 earlier in today’s session, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $41,607.47 on Monday.Although BTC is now trading around the $41,379 area, it remains 0.45% lower than yesterday’s high above the $42,200 ceiling.Today’s session saw bitcoin fall below its floor of $40,580, which is its lowest level since last Friday, as markets were preparing for the weekend.Looking at the chart, the reversal in price momentum came as BTC hit its long-term resistance point of $42,200, leading to bears re-entering the market.In addition to this ceiling, the 14-day RSI was also unable to move past its own ceiling of 55, and now sits at 51.5.Should this momentum persist, we could see bitcoin below $40,000 in the upcoming days.Although BTC fell, ETH remained marginally higher as of writing, as prices continued to trade above the $2,900 level.On Monday, ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $2,934.69, as prices rebounded following a selloff during Sunday’s session.The price of ETH fell as the asset approached the $3,010 ceiling, which comes as traders appear to have closed positions, leading to a turnaround, as seen before at this level.Despite the reversal which came, there was enough bullish pressure in ETH to keep prices from falling below $2,900, with ETH/USD now up over 14% in the last seven days.This momentum could see further gains come this week, as bulls seem to still be present at this level.Could we see a full ETH breakout above $3,000 this week?

2,"Terra Founder Hints at $3 Billion BTC Purchase, Explains New Bitcoin-Linked Tokenomics","Mar 21, 2022","Terra founder Do Kwon hinted at a future purchase of $3 billion worth of bitcoin to supply the reserves of the protocol in a recent Twitter Space shared with bitcoin enthusiast Udi Wertheimer. In the same Space, Do Kwon explained the new mechanics that the Terra ecosystem is introducing in order to use bitcoin as collateral for its flagship decentralized stablecoin, UST.Do Kwon, founder of Terra and Terraform Labs, made some important announcements regarding the future of the Terra ecosystem and its tokens in a Twitter Space hosted by Udi Wertheimer. One of these announcements has to do with the inclusion of new token mechanics that take into consideration some form of bitcoin in the Terra ecosystem. In this regard, Kwon announced Terra is working toward bringing a form of tokenized bitcoin to the Terra blockchain in the most decentralized form possible.Kwon also explained that with the inclusion of bitcoin, UST would become a hybrid stablecoin, allowing users to exchange $1 worth of UST for $0.99 worth of BTC. This would effectively allow users to redeem BTC by using UST for a premium of 1%, almost in the same way that LUNA is being used right now. Kwon clarified that these mechanics will be explained in the near future in a more detailed way.When asked about why Terra chose bitcoin as a reserve asset, Kwon stated:I mean a couple of reasons here, but put simply, bitcoin is the only hard reserve asset that’s been proven out of the digital currencies… It is very difficult for somebody in crypto to question bitcoin.Kwon expects this new tokenized version of bitcoin in the Terra ecosystem to become the de facto reserve currency of many protocols built on top of the chain, expanding to be part of every smart contract application that holds any treasury. In light of this, Kwon announced some numbers regarding the amount of bitcoin Terra will purchase in the short term. The Terraform Labs CEO stated the company has a budget to buy $3 billion worth of bitcoin in the short term and announced that most of this bitcoin has not been bought yet.Do Kwon concluded by announcing that the protocol, through the Luna Foundation Guard, plans to become a regular buyer of bitcoin for the aforementioned purpose.What do you think about the announcements made by Do Kwon in Udi Wertheimer’s Space?

3,"Bitcoin-Friendly Portugal Welcomes Refugees From Ukraine’s Crypto Sector, Report Reveals","Mar 21, 2022","With a war raging in their homeland, thousands of Ukrainians, including many involved in the crypto space, have chosen Portugal as their new home. The country is an attractive destination, not only because of its warmer climate but also its relatively affordable cost of living and crypto-friendly tax regime.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent millions of refugees fleeing to other European nations and Portugal is no exception. Despite the great distance from the conflict zone, the country has already accepted 13,000 refugees in the past weeks after the authorities in Lisbon simplified the arrival procedures for Ukrainians.Those among them who had been working in Ukraine’s growing crypto industry are likely to find it easier to settle down in Portugal than in other countries on the Old Continent, BNN Bloomberg noted in a report. Much like Ukraine before the war, this EU member state is becoming a cryptocurrency hub thanks to some bitcoin-friendly policies.Portugal maintains a zero-percent levy on profits from private crypto investments. When these gains are not resulting from professional activities, they are not subject to income tax. Some foreign nationals can also benefit from a flat 20% income tax and 10% tax on pensions.The article tells the story of Valentin Sotov, a software developer working on a crypto-based metaverse game called Amber, who fled Western Ukraine with two of his colleagues. They are now hoping to continue their work from an office in Lisbon although Sotov admits it has been challenging to find permanent accommodations:You have to have a contract for a year, and you need to have a Portuguese guarantor, and you need to have a tax number and a visa. We don’t know what to do yet, we are asking our friends.Despite the difficulties, the 35-year-old Ukrainian points to the positive side of his move to Portugal. “All the people here are very open, it’s a parade of nations,” he says, adding that he looks at the relocation as a big opportunity for his company’s product because of the availability of IT expertise in the country.Maria Yarotska, another Ukrainian crypto worker escaping the war, will be able to keep her job even in Portugal as her employer, a blockchain project with a Ukrainian co-founder, Near, is expanding its business in the country while supporting refugees like her. “I have a lot of colleagues here. They’ll help me legalize my documents so I can stay,” Yarotska told the publication.Ukraine, a leader in bitcoin adoption in Eastern Europe, was becoming a crypto hotspot when Russia launched its assault. The government has been taking steps to legalize and regulate the country’s crypto space. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently signed the law “On Virtual Assets.” Amid the ongoing hostilities, Kyiv has been relying on crypto donations to fund its military defense and solve humanitarian problems.Even before the current migration, Portugal was home to a relatively sizable Ukrainian diaspora, representing the fifth-largest group of foreign nationals. With the refugees now, the number of Ukrainians residing in the country has reached around 40,000, which is already the nation’s third-largest group of foreign citizens.Do you expect more Ukrainian crypto companies and their employees to move to Portugal? Let us know in the comments section below.

4,Prince Philip of Serbia: Bitcoin Is Freedom — Says 'We Need to Take the Money Away From the State',"Mar 20, 2022","Prince Philip of Serbia and Yugoslavia says that bitcoin is freedom. Noting that “we need to take the money away from the state,” the prince stressed: “We need to have hard money again. We need to have good quality money that’s not subject to inflation.”
Prince Philip of Serbia and Yugoslavia recently talked about bitcoin on a Serbian TV show hosted by Ivan Ivanović. Prince Philip, a member of the House of Karađorđević, is the second son of the last crown prince of the former Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He is the fraternal twin of Prince Alexander and the second-in-line to the throne after Prince Peter.Prince Philip is currently working with a global asset manager in London, according to the Royal Family of Serbia’s website.“I work in finance,” he confirmed on the TV show. “I work in asset management for an international finance company. The head office is in New York but has a big office in London. I’m an analyst. I love to analyze the world.”He added: “I analyze and mainly tell clients what happens with the market, what’s going on with their portfolios, and I speak with a lot of other analysts and a lot of other portfolio managers within the company. We help to make decisions … It’s a great experience to be an analyst. I learn a lot.”He was then asked about crypto. Emphasizing that his advice “is definitely for free,” he began by saying “crypto” but quickly corrected himself to say “bitcoin.” Prince Philip said: “Not crypto but bitcoin. It’s only about bitcoin.” He continued:Bitcoin is freedom, and this is something I want for everyone.He described: “This is something everyone has to learn. They will learn slowly. Some people will not want to learn it because they are not used to it. They want to protect the system that they do well in.”The prince noted: “But they don’t realize that that system, well maybe they do, is not advantageous to everyone else in the world, so billions of people around the world are not having a good time right now.”The prince was interrupted by Ivanović after he said, “Well we need to take the money away from the state.” The TV host cautioned that the royalty’s statement could be misinterpreted. Both laughed.Prince Philip proceeded to emphasize:I think we need to have hard money again. We need to have good quality money that’s not subject to inflation.Referring to inflation, he said the problem is happening now and “Especially since that last financial crisis in 2008 which extraordinary stimulus has been pumped into the economies.” He detailed: “And since then with the Corona pandemic, unprecedented amounts of stimulus have been pumped into the economy and, of course, where is this money going to go? It’s going to create inflation.”Prince Philip proceeded to talk about bitcoin. “With Bitcoin, you don’t have that. You have a cap of only 21 million bitcoins that are going to be produced,” he described, adding:Therefore it’s never going to be an inflationary asset and this helps to protect people.“On top of that, it’s censorship-free. It’s very fungible. You can move it around … and it will help with people’s sovereignty, and it helps with people’s freedom,” the prince concluded.What do you think about Prince Philip’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

5,Ron Paul Cautions Government Could Still Ban Bitcoin — Says He's Influenced 'a Whole Lot' by History,"Mar 19, 2022","Former U.S. Congressman Ron Paul says he still believes that the government could outlaw bitcoin mainly because he is “influenced a whole lot by history and the gold history.” Despite his warning, Paul stressed that crypto “should be obviously permitted.”Former presidential candidate Ron Paul discussed the future of bitcoin and the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine war in an interview with Kitco news’ Michelle Makori Thursday.Paul is an American author, physician, and retired politician. The former representative from Texas launched The Ron Paul Liberty Report in 2015 to bring “provocative opinion and analysis to the breaking issues affecting our lives and finances,” its website details.The former congressman has repeatedly warned that the government could crack down on bitcoin. “My concern is that governments over centuries have been notoriously very eager to have control of the money. Believe me, they will not give up control of money,” he described.However, interest in bitcoin has soared recently with more institutional investors supporting the ecosystem. This week, the Ukrainian government created a legal framework for cryptocurrency following the invasion by Russia. It also set up an official crypto donation website. Moreover, BTC is currently legal tender in El Salvador.Paul was asked if he still believes that bitcoin is at risk of being outright banned or outlawed. He replied:Yeah, I do, mainly because I’m influenced a whole lot by history, and the gold history, and my interest in studying money and some of the principles that Austrian economics teaches about what the nature of money should be.Nonetheless, Paul emphasized:But that doesn’t sway me from arguing the case for those who know about crypto, who understand it better than I do, that it should be obviously permitted. But a lot of people don’t understand it so I would be cautious.He further shared: “I’ve been trying to figure out, is [bitcoin] more like a stock or a bond or a hard asset commodity. Right now, I would say, looking at different statistics, it seems to trace stock prices.”In June last year, the former congressman said he wants bitcoin to be totally legalized to compete with the U.S. dollar and let the people decide. “My goal is to legalize the competition and the people will sort it out. Freedom of choice will sort it out,” he opined.What do you think about Ron Paul’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

6,Peter Thiel Says His ‘Biggest Mistake of the Decade Was Getting Too Late and Too Little Into Bitcoin’,"Mar 19, 2022","During a discussion published on March 12, 2022, the billionaire entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Peter Thiel discussed how he built Paypal with fellow co-founders Max Levchin, David Sacks, and Luke Nosek. Toward the end of the hour-long conversation, the topic quickly turned to cryptocurrencies and Thiel stressed that his “biggest mistake” during the last ten years “was getting too late and too little into bitcoin.” Last week, the new book dubbed “The Founders” written by Jimmy Soni was discussed at great length during a panel conversation with the co-founders of Paypal. The book called “The Founders: The Story of Paypal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley,” was published last month and the story gives an account of Paypal’s origins.The callin.com broadcast published on March 12, features the Paypal co-founders Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, David Sacks, and Luke Nosek. While most of the conversation touches on the Paypal origins topic, at the 55:30 mark, the discussion turned to cryptocurrencies. The host of the discussion managed to squeeze in one more question, as he said “it would not be a tech conversation without a little bit of wild-eyed forward-looking statements.”The discussion host explained that amid Paypal’s rise, a “whole crypto thing going on” and he highlighted how Peter Thiel has “written and spoken a lot about it.” When asked what the group thinks about “payment systems now and crypto,” Thiel responded. The Paypal co-founder remarked:The biggest mistake I made in the last decade was getting too late and too little into bitcoin.Thiel explained further: “You know, we invested in 2014 in Founders Fund and did reasonably well, but it was on my radar in 2010 and 2011 — We had seen all these crazy cryptocurrency people, at the time at Paypal, it was one of the things that I was actually super interested in and it motivated me, but none of the models quite worked.” Thiel further added:With bitcoin, I was somehow programmed to not to see it as much as I should have.The Paypal co-founder’s statements last week are similar to the declarations he made in October. Speaking at a cryptocurrency event in Miami last year, Thiel told participants that he felt like he was “underinvested in [bitcoin].” Speaking further on the benefits of bitcoin in Miami, Thiel stressed that bitcoin was “the canary in the coal mine — It’s the most honest market we have in the country.”What do you think about the Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel’s statements about bitcoin and his remorse for not getting into it much sooner?

7,Member of St. Maarten’s Parliament Plans to Have His Entire Salary Paid in Bitcoin Cash,"Mar 19, 2022","On Saturday, the leader of the United People’s Party and member of St. Maarten’s Parliament, Rolando Brison, announced that he’s become the first elected official to request his entire salary paid in bitcoin cash. Brison believes St. Maarten can be the “Crypto Capital of the Caribbean,” as long as his country continues to embrace blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions.While El Salvador is known for its bitcoin tender law, the Caribbean has become a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption and more specifically with bitcoin cash (BCH). Data from map.bitcoin.com shows there are currently hundreds of merchants in the Caribbean accepting BCH for goods and services. On March 19, a member of St. Maarten’s Parliament and the leader of the United People’s Party (UP Party St. Maarten), Rolando Brison, announced that he is receiving his entire salary in bitcoin cash (BCH).The government official believes that St. Maarten should continue its path toward delving “into the ever-growing cryptocurrency phenomenon.” Brison insisted during his announcement that he has requested St. Maarten’s finance minister Ardwell Irion to update him on plans for using blockchain technology in government. “I believe St. Maarten has a chance to be the ‘Crypto Capital of the Caribbean’ if we continue to innovate and embrace cryptocurrency and all the benefits of blockchain technology,” Brison explained in a statement on Saturday.On Twitter, the St. Maarten elected official told his followers that he was the first member of the government to get his entire salary in crypto asset payments. “Today I become to first elected official in the world to have his entire salary paid in bitcoin cash, as our country moves more and more to making use of cryptocurrency and blockchain,” Brison tweeted. “Thanks [Roger Ver] for the guidance in making St Maarten the Crypto Capital of the Caribbean,” the St. Maarten UP Party leader added.During the announcement, Brison noted that during a conference last year, St. Maarten’s finance minister said that crypto and blockchain adoption was a priority area to research. Brison remarked that he appreciated the finance minister’s ideas of moving toward innovation. The UP Party leader said that the next important step was to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain legislation.“While we need to improve our legacy forms of commercial banking by means of my proposed consumer banking legislation, we simultaneously need create legislation to make cryptocurrency transactions even more effective and worthwhile in St. Maarten,” Brison explained. The member of St. Maarten’s Parliament added that he has started to explore legislation to make bitcoin cash (BCH) legal tender in the country. Furthermore, Brison aims to get BCH and non-fungible token (NFT) transactions exempt from St. Maarten’s capital gains tax.“The concept of ‘Money’ has been experiencing and will continue to experience a wave of innovation,” the St. Maarten elected official added. “This innovation comes as we as a country and as Parliamentarians are faced with more questions on how to adapt our local currency and (E)commerce for a digital world. Fortunately, the answer lies right in front of us – Bitcoin Cash.”What do you think about the St. Maarten UP Party leader and Parliament member Rolando Brison getting his entire salary paid in bitcoin cash?

8,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Nears $3,000 to Start the Weekend","Mar 19, 2022","Ethereum rallied on Saturday, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency moved closer to the $3,000 level. The global crypto market cap was over 4% higher as of writing, with bitcoin climbing by nearly 3.5%.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $42,000 for the first time in ten days to start the weekend, as cryptocurrencies rallied, following a week of volatility.Crypto prices were traded with high levels of uncertainty following the Fed rate hike, however, as markets seem to have finally moved past this news, bitcoin bulls once again reappeared. As of writing this, BTC/USD rose to a high of $42,195.74 to commence the weekend, following an intraday low of $40,402.06 less than 24-hours ago.Today’s surge has seen the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue), moving averages cross, however, the direction of the crossover remains in doubt, due to recent price uncertainty.Looking at the chart, bitcoin now hovers below its long-term resistance level of $42,080, which is a point that has not been successfully broken since February 28.In addition to this ceiling, the 14-day RSI also tracks at a resistance level of 55.4, if both hurdles are passed, many could be targeting a $45,000 point for BTC.Ethereum (ETH) rose to its highest level in over two weeks on Saturday, as prices climbed for a sixth consecutive session. Last week saw ethereum trade predominantly near its support of $2,550, however, since the turn of the week, markets had consistently moved away from this point.On Saturday, ETH/USD came within a stone’s throw away from the 3K mark, as prices hit a peak of $2,973.62.With the RSI indicator continuing to move past obstacles, and now tracking at a six-week high, the expectation is that we will see ETH at $3,000 before the end of today’s action.This could however be a bull trap set by bears, as history has also shown several market reversals that occur at this point.Will ethereum continue to climb once it moves past $3,000?

Some agreed with him about BTC being aligned with American values but disagreed that the cryptocurrency will strengthen the U.S. dollar.The Chamber of Digital Commerce replied to Sessions: “Thank you for your leadership and support … We couldn’t agree more!” Blockchain Investment Group founder Eric Weiss said, “Pete gets it.” Core Scientific founder Darin Feinstein told Sessions that he is “100% correct.”Morgan Creek Digital Assets co-founder Anthony Pompliano wrote: “Bitcoin embodies the American ethos of free markets and free speech.” The New York Times bestselling author Mark Jeffrey suggested, “The U.S. Treasury should begin stockpiling bitcoin reserves immediately,” tagging President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in his tweet.Another Twitter user argued, “Bitcoin is aligned with American values, the dollar is not.” A number of people stressed that bitcoin will destroy the U.S. dollar.Sessions also tweeted about bitcoin being a hedge against inflation earlier this week. “Inflation is taxation on every American,” he wrote, emphasizing that “CPI rose 7.9% through February — the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years.” The lawmaker from Texas added:Bitcoin is trending to be a more resilient alternative option to hedge against fiat-currency inflation.In December last year, Sessions urged Congress to be supportive of the crypto industry after the top executives of six major crypto companies testified before the House Committee on Financial Services. Commenting on the hearing, Sessions said: “I am tremendously impressed. I see a lot of ingenuity, a lot of entrepreneurial spirit. We need to be supportive of you.”The lawmaker subsequently tweeted:My hope is that Congress will work with the digital asset market in its infancy to help Americans prosper and progress us forward as leaders on the world stage.In February, Sessions reportedly appointed Indian-American Himanshu B. Patel as the chief economic development and energy infrastructure advisor for his crypto technical working group.What do you think about Congressman Pete Sessions’ comments?

11,Bitcoin Miners Catch a Second Break With Another Downward Difficulty Adjustment,"Mar 18, 2022","Five days ago, Bitcoin’s hashrate had shown improvement as it increased 15% over the course of ten days and today, the computational power remains above the 200 exahash per second (EH/s) region. Meanwhile, bitcoin miners caught another break on Thursday, as the network’s mining difficulty adjusted downward for the second time in a row, making it 0.35% less difficult to find a block reward.At the time of writing, the computational power behind the Bitcoin (BTC) network is coasting along at 213.27 EH/s, and for a majority of the time during the last seven days BTC’s hashpower has remained above 200 EH/s. On Thursday, at block height 727,776, bitcoin miners caught a break when the network’s mining difficulty dropped downwards 0.35%. The 0.35% slide is the second drop in a row after the network’s difficulty slid 1.49% on March 3.With the two difficulty drops combined, it is now 1.84% easier to find a bitcoin block subsidy than it was before March 3. On that day, the difficulty was 27.96 trillion and at the time of writing, Bitcoin’s network difficulty is 27.45 trillion. The downward drop on Thursday at block height 727,776 was a small shift downward, as it was expected to increase according to estimations recorded on March 13. While the difficulty has seen two consecutive decreases, prior to those adjustments, the difficulty increased six times in a row.Despite the 1.84% difficulty decrease over the last month, BTC’s mining difficulty is still the highest it’s been during the network’s lifetime. The network’s all-time difficulty high was the 27.96 trillion that miners dealt with before the 1.49% dip at block height 725,760. Furthermore, there are still 11 known mining pools dedicating hashpower to the network and around 2.35 EH/s of hashrate belongs to unknown miners. Stealth miners — often referred to as an “unknown” pool — have found 12 bitcoin blocks during the last week.Seven-day statistics indicate that Foundry USA was the week’s top bitcoin mining pool capturing 228 bitcoin blocks. Weekly metrics show Foundry USA commands 21.76% of the global hashrate, or 44.62 EH/s. The second-largest miner in terms of seven-day hashrate stats is F2pool as the pool acquired 141 bitcoin block rewards this past week.F2pool’s hashrate represents 13.45% of the global hashrate with the pool’s 27.59 EH/s of hashpower. Foundry USA and F2pool are followed by Antpool, Poolin, and Viabtc, respectively, in terms of the top five mining pools during the past week. With the current hashrate speed it is estimated that the next difficulty change will take place in just over 12 days from now.As mentioned above, the estimation of exactly when the adjustment will happen and how much it will decrease or increase is an educated guess made by leveraging current statistics. Estimations currently show the difficulty change in 12 days’ time could be a 0.57% increase. Although, by the time it gets closer, Bitcoin’s difficulty change could increase a lot more than that, or even experience another downward adjustment.What do you think about Bitcoin’s difficulty dropping for the second time in a row?

12,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Remains Above $40,000 Despite Recent Pullback","Mar 18, 2022","Following a rise to a high beyond $41,700 earlier this week, bitcoin’s price has fallen for two consecutive sessions. Despite this, BTC continues to trade above $40,000, whilst ETH continues to hover above $2,800. BTC fell for its second consecutive session on Friday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency has lost some momentum, following Wednesday’s Fed decision.Yesterday saw bitcoin trade at a peak of $41,102.23, however as of writing, prices have fallen to an intraday low of $40,302.40.This drop means that BTC/USD is 1.66% lower than Thursday’s high, and comes as prices have fallen back below long-term resistance.The ceiling, which resides at $40,600, was broken earlier today and this enticed bears to sell even further, due to the historical action which took place there previously.Looking at the chart, the engulfing bearish candles on March 4 and 10 act as a reminder how quickly gains can be lost, and this lead to some bulls liquidating their positions.Despite this, the 14-day RSI still remains above 50, which is one of the indications that price strength is still marginally trending upward.ETH mainly traded above $2,800 on Friday, as prices continued to hover below recent resistance of $2,850. Following Thursday’s low of $2,774.86, ETH/USD hit a peak of $2,826.16 during today’s session, as moving averages prepared for an upwards cross.As can be seen from the chart, the 10-day moving average and the 25-day have finally collided, with the short-term average set to overtake mid-term. Despite recent price volatility, the last seven days have seen ETH climb by an average of 7%, and if moving averages extend this trend, we could see further surges in price.The only hurdle that remains appears to be the 55.5 ceiling that is currently present in the 14-day RSI.Will we see the next surge in crypto commence this weekend?

13,"Co-Founder of Bitmex Predicts Gold Rising to $10K, Bitcoin Marching to $1 Million","Mar 18, 2022","On March 16, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitmex, published a blog post called “Energy Cancelled,” which describes the economics behind the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Hayes explains in his 26-minute long opinion piece that historians may point to February 26, 2022, as the time in history when the “Petro Dollar / Euro Dollar monetary system” ended.There’s been a lot of economic calamity since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as financial conditions worldwide have tightened and Russia has been sanctioned by a large swathe of countries. Analysts and economists believe the war and sanctions could have negative effects on the global economy and on March 5, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the “economic consequences are already very serious.” A few days after the IMF warning, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill that sanctions Russia’s gold reserves.Reports indicated on March 13, that the Russian Federation finance minister, Anton Siluanov, explained that half of the country’s gold and foreign reserves were frozen. “This is about half of these reserves that we had. We have a total amount of reserves of about $640 bln,” Siluanov said. “Currently, we cannot use about $300 billion of these reserves,” the Russian finance minister added.Siluanov’s statements have led to speculation concerning an independent international monetary and financial system between the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and China. Moreover, a great deal of vagueness and confusion concerning the Russian’s frozen gold. The journalist Pepe Escobar highlights in his report called “Say hello to Russian gold and Chinese petroyuan,” that there is a mystery to be solved. “Where is that frozen Russian gold?” Escobar’s report asks.Meanwhile, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitmex, Arthur Hayes, published a blog post on March 16, that touches upon canceling the world’s largest energy exporter and the end of the “Petro Dollar / Euro Dollar monetary system”What happens when you ""cancel"" the world's largest energy producer … ? ""Energy Cancelled"" is an essay on why the post-1971 Petro / Eurodollar regime died on 26 February 2022. Are you ready for $1 million #Bitcoin and $10,000 #Gold?https://t.co/EttRAmPPS9 pic.twitter.com/LOSqaseq3N— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 16, 2022The blog post written by Hayes is extremely long, but comprehensive and filled with sourced data. Hayes stresses that historians will likely call February 26, 2022, as the end of the monetary system controlled by the “Petro Dollar” and “Euro Dollar.”Furthermore, Hayes believes a financial crisis will take place and it will stretch across every aspect of the financial system worldwide. “I am 100% certain that there will be a financial crisis of epic proportions predicated on losses faced by commodity producers and traders who touch every aspect of the globalised financial system,” the Bitmex co-founder’s blog post explains. Hayes added:You cannot remove the world’s largest energy producer — and the collateral these commodity resources represent — from the financial system without serious unimagined and unintended consequences.The blog post written by the Bitmex co-founder details how the U.S. and the dollar became a dominant force in the world of finance. At one time America was dominant in industrial and manufacturing businesses, but Hayes says these days “America exports finance, not goods, to the world on a macro scale.”Hayes also talked about fiat currencies and how humans have devised ways to send “value electronically over centralised permissioned digital networks.” While the SWIFT payments network is operated by a number of countries, Hayes insists SWIFT is “effectively controlled by the U.S. and EU.”Hayes explains that there are vulnerabilities when a ruling nation “decides to block access to the network to any participants.” He says that the point begs the question: “Should you ‘save’ in assets that ride on this centralised, permissioned digital monetary network?” The blog post highlights that there’s a level of trust given that a nation state will not “expropriate your ‘savings.’” The Bitmex founder’s blog post adds:Remember this, you own nothing, you merely ‘rent’ your net worth both as an individual or sovereign from the entity that operates the centralised, permissioned fiat digital monetary network.Further into the blog post, Hayes says that he believes gold will “phase shift” a great deal higher than the price is today. He believes competition and demand “will push the marginal last price well north of $10,000, and we could see stupendous prices for gold that seems unfathomable.”Gold jumping to $10K per ounce or higher will “psychologically shock” the world’s asset markets, Hayes notes. Hayes wholeheartedly believes that most hard assets that people use to hedge will skyrocket in value and this includes bitcoin (BTC).“As gold marches its way above $10,000, bitcoin will march its way to $1,000,000. The bear market in fiat currencies will trigger the largest wealth transfer the world has ever seen,” Hayes explains. He adds that he believes both gold and bitcoin are forms of hard money assets. “Both are hard money, one is analog (gold) one is digital (bitcoin),” Hayes writes.Toward the end of the Bitmex executive’s blog post, he describes the pros and cons tied to storing wealth in gold and how it can be cumbersome to store. “Most readers don’t have a vault in a freeport in which to store their yellow pet rocks — Instead, you would like a more transportable hard store of wealth,” Hayes says.Hayes finishes his blog post by repeating that “you cannot cancel the largest energy producer from a monetary system without massive repercussions.” He deduces after the fog of war is dispersed, the economy will “present a situation where hard money instruments rule all of global trade.”What do you think about the recent blog post published by the Bitmex founder Arthur Hayes?

14,Mike Novogratz Expects Bitcoin to Hit $500K — Says BTC Is a Great Alternative in Economies With Poor Stewardship,"Mar 17, 2022","Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says bitcoin is a great alternative and a lifeline to people in countries with poor stewardship of the economy. He expects the price of the cryptocurrency to hit $500K. “We see an adoption cycle that accelerates … going viral everywhere,” he said.Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz talked about the outlook for bitcoin and the U.S. dollar in a couple of interviews this week.“The biggest thing that’s happened in the last 10 years in lots of ways, maybe longer, is when Europe and the U.S. said: ‘Hey Russia, those reserves that you thought were yours, they’re not really your reserves,'” he told Bloomberg Tuesday.Elaborating on what he meant, the Galaxy Digital executive detailed:It means the dollar or treasuries as a risk-free asset isn’t so risk free. It’s not risk free if you’re Russian and maybe if you’re Chinese, it might not be risk free either.“So I think we are entering a world that’s unknown where people are going to struggle to figure out what is the reserve currency,” he opined.“The U.S. isn’t going away. The dollar isn’t going away. But it’s not going to be the sole place. So I think you are going to see this hodgepodge of assets,” Novogratz described.“Gold and, certainly, digital assets are going to be part of that bucket. The whole world is not going to flip to bitcoin overnight but you are going to see more and more people say: ‘I wanna have some of my money outside of the sovereign,'” he explained.Noting that “The Russian ruble has depreciated over 90% in the last 10 years” and “The Turkish lira did the same,” Novogratz said:Bitcoin is a lifeline to people in countries with really poor stewardship of the economy.He similarly told CNBC Thursday: “When there’s bad stewardship of economies … bitcoin provides a great alternative.”While admitting, “our stewardship has not been great,” the executive stressed: “If you were in Russia, you would feel pretty stupid having all of your money in rubles. Or if you were in Turkey, you’d feel pretty stupid having all your money in the Turkish lira.”The Galaxy Digital boss was asked about his price prediction for bitcoin. He replied:Five years out, if bitcoin is not at $500,000 then I’m wrong on the adoption cycle.“We see an adoption cycle that accelerates. Bitcoin grew so much faster last year, crypto grew, than the internet did its best years in the 90s. I see this going viral everywhere,” he shared.Novogratz also commented on the executive order on the regulation of cryptocurrency signed by President Joe Biden last week. He noted: “The politics have shifted even on the Democratic side. It’s no longer anti-crypto, it’s like: ‘Hold on, there’re a lot of crypto voters.'”What do you think about Mike Novogratz’s comments?

15,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH up to 2-Week High Following Fed Rate Hike","Mar 17, 2022","Ethereum climbed to a two-week high on Thursday, as markets continued to react to yesterday’s Fed decision. As expected, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 0.25%, whilst providing forward guidance for future hikes. BTC was once again trading above $40,000. BTC was trading above $40,000 for a second consecutive session, as bullish pressure remained within the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This momentum comes as traders were somewhat relieved by the Fed’s decision to lift rates, which helped remove some recent market tension.As of writing, BTC/USD is 1.4% higher than yesterday’s low, and has risen to an intraday high of $41,323.26 during today’s session.Even if a cross does occur, market uncertainty will likely remain until the current ceiling of $42,100 is broken.This may only occur once another resistance point has been passed, this time in the form of the 14-day RSI.As seen from the chart, the RSI is tracking at 53, which is marginally below its ceiling of 54.4. Bulls are likely anticipating a break beyond this point, prior to intensifying upside pressure.ETH rallied to its highest level since March 4 during today’s session, as it approaches a new resistance level above $2,800.Following yesterday’s low of $2,647.29, ETH/USD hit a peak of $2,807.80 on Thursday, as traders continued to push prices around from the long-term support. Whilst we move away from support at $2,550, ETH is now on a crash course for resistance at $2,850, a level which hasn’t been broken in over two weeks.Unlike BTC, price strength in ethereum appears to have peaked, as the 14-day RSI indicator currently sits right below resistance of 54.9.This ceiling has not been broken since mid-February, and once it eventually does give way, we will likely be looking at the $3,000 level. Could we see ETH above $3,000 before the weekend? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

16,US Justice Department Returns Stolen Bitcoin to Victim of Government Imposter Scam,"Mar 16, 2022","The U.S. Justice Department has seized bitcoin stolen from an elderly man in a government imposter scam and will be returning the cryptocurrency to him. “The fraudsters deceived the victim into believing his personal information had been used to facilitate a drug trafficking and money laundering scheme,” detailed the DOJ.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday “the successful forfeiture and return of stolen cryptocurrency to [an] elderly man victimized by government imposter scam.”The DOJ explained that in August last year, fraudsters contacted the victim by phone claiming to be with the Office of the Inspector General, adding:The fraudsters deceived the victim into believing his personal information had been used to facilitate a drug trafficking and money laundering scheme, and as a result all of the victim’s assets would be frozen.“One of the imposters, who identified himself as agent James Hoffman, told the victim that he was required to deposit funds into a secure government account until the government verified that the victim was not involved in criminal activity,” said the Justice Department.The scammers further demanded all of the victim’s personal identifying information and details regarding his financial accounts, the DOJ noted.They proceeded to direct the victim to “use hundreds of thousands of dollars of his retirement funds” to purchase bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.According to the DOJ:On August 31, 2021, 12.164699 bitcoin, worth approximately $574,766, was transferred from the victim’s Coinbase account to the account controlled by the imposters.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Coinbase ultimately identified the transfer as possible elder financial fraud. “Following an investigation and successful civil forfeiture proceedings, the seized cryptocurrency was forfeited to the United States and will be returned to the victim,” the Justice Department confirmed.What do you think about this case?

17,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Back Above $40,000, ETH Eyes $3,000 as Fed Meeting Looms","Mar 16, 2022","Following days of consolidation, bitcoin rallied above $40,000 on Tuesday, which comes as markets prepare for today’s Fed meeting. ETH also climbed, moving away from its recent support point in the process. BTC finally broke out of its recent streak of price consolidation on Tuesday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed to almost a one week high.Following a low of $38,567.64 yesterday, BTC/USD has so far risen to an intraday high of $41,717.45 so far this session.Today’s high saw BTC break past one resistance level at $40,590, but it lost steam once it approached the ceiling of $42,000. Wednesday’s surge comes as bulls re-entered the market, heading into the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, where it is expected that interest rates will be hiked by 25 basis points or 0.25%. Looking at the chart, the RSI indicator shows this, with price strength moving beyond its resistance of 49.6 for the first time since March 9. Should this momentum be sustained, traders will likely target a higher high above $42,000, potentially even the $45,000 ceiling. ETH was also higher during today’s session, and as of writing, was trading over 6% higher than yesterday’s low of $2,526.40.Following yesterday’s low, which fell below support of $2,550, ETH/USD hit a peak of $2,722.99 today, as Jerome Powell readies himself for this afternoon’s meeting. Although up, ETH has lost some of its earlier gains, with the $2,750 point providing price uncertainty, resulting in bears viewing this as an entry point. This comes as the 14-day RSI also appears to have run into a wall of its own, with the 50.34 level acting as a ceiling.Should ETH be able to jump past both of these hurdles, we will likely see prices track above $3,000, and this afternoon’s decision could be the trigger. Do you believe the Fed should hold off on a rate hike? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

18,BTC Proxy Announces Strategic Partnership With Blockchain․com to Expand Bitcoin DeFi Ecosystem,"Mar 16, 2022","PRESS RELEASE. BTC Proxy, the Bitcoin Liquidity Protocol on Polygon, has entered into a strategic partnership with Blockchain.com, one of the world’s largest crypto platforms and an early pioneer of key Bitcoin infrastructure. As part of the partnership, Blockchain.com will add BTC Liquidity into the Proxy ecosystem by Minting BTCpx. Moving Bitcoin to the Polygon network will expand the DeFi ecosystem and provide reward opportunities for users.BTC Proxy believes it has solved a real pain point with Bitcoin by creating a mechanism of interoperability to access stored value from long-term holders without sacrificing safety through the use of qualified custodians. This tokenized volume can then be utilized to provide liquidity and drive value to all the networks involved.BTCpx is the tokenized receipt of Bitcoin (BTC) that has been deposited into a qualified custodian. In this arrangement, the BTCpx is used to navigate through carefully crafted and sustainable reward programs whilst keeping the Bitcoin under multiple layers of security and allowing for even greater accountability and safety than ever before.“This relationship with Blockchain.com involves the participation of one of the original and most trusted names in crypto. It is a significant milestone for the project and signals confidence within the institutional space to see BTC Proxy as an option for significant Bitcoin holders.” — Donn Kim, CEO BTC ProxyMinting BTCpx is a decentralized process that happens when BTC is deposited into a specified deposit address at a Custodian. The protocol mints the BTCpx token upon detection and confirmation of the deposit.The significance of Blockchain.com’s participation extends beyond the amount of BTC being deposited; it also ushers in the participation of the Polygon Foundation, incentivizing the additional movement of BTC with $Matic Tokens while simultaneously increasing the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network. The Polygon Foundation will also offer $Matic Tokens each time a user Mints BTCpx onto Polygon. This provides new users coming to the network, and gas to perform the subsequent transactions. These incentives and much more will be summed up in an upcoming marketing campaign dubbed #BTConPolygon. Stay tuned for more details.“More Bitcoin supply being kept in cold storage signifies a holding culture. Therefore, holding is a favoured strategy in the Bitcoin market, with long-term holders and crypto whales leading the race.”  — Blockchain.news Sept 24 2021Depositing Bitcoin into one of BTC Proxy’s insured custodial partners ensures the safest holding environments.“Bitcoin is unlike an altcoin where custody is not taken into consideration and where safety is heavily favored over risk.” — Donn KimThree Mechanisms Increase TVL of the Network Within the DeFi ecosystem, BTCpx can be staked into a program called iBTCpx (Interest Bearing BTCpx) which yields $PRXY governance tokens for each block. $PRXY derives its value from the Total Value Locked (TVL) gained from Minting, Staking and then Restaking ( MCAP/TVL ratios of most DeFi protocols can be researched at DefiLlama). Restaking allows participants to accelerate their gains when they Claim and Stake the $PRXY rewards into the main Compounding Staking Pool. Detailed Calculations can be found below.

19,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Fails to Breakout of $40,000 Resistance Level","Mar 15, 2022","On the eve of tomorrow’s FOMC meeting, bitcoin once again failed to climb past its long-term resistance level of $40,000, as markets consolidated. Although prices moved away from recent support, upside momentum slowed as BTC neared its ceiling. As of writing, ETH was trading at its level of support. Bitcoin came close to breaking out of its $40,000 resistance point on Tuesday, as markets prepared for tomorrow’s FOMC meeting.Following a low of $37,773.21 on Monday, BTC/USD has so far risen to an intraday high of $39,742.50 today.Today’s high saw BTC on the cusp of its ceiling, however with the current volatility in the market, strength turned to weakness as prices dropped. This drop resulted in BTC/USD falling to a low of $38,310.21 earlier today, however it has since rebounded and is once again trading above $39,000.Looking at the chart, the RSI indicator is currently tracking at 47.9, which is marginally below resistance of 49.Markets are likely waiting for the results of tomorrow’s meeting, and press conference, prior to us seeing the next upside or downside trend.If there were a cryptocurrency which encapsulates the current uncertainty in the market, it would be ETH, which once again consolidated.As of writing, ETH/USD is trading $10 above its recent support level of $2,550, following an earlier low of $2,515.77. The price of ethereum has largely consolidated in the last few weeks, trading between a floor of $2,550 and ceiling of $2,840. Despite the odd breakout, this sideways action has led to the 14-day RSI also tracking in neutral territory, with neither bulls nor bears taking charge of price strength.Like BTC, this could change tomorrow, as the FOMC meeting could give crypto markets a sense of direction, once this current monetary cloud is lifted. Will a rate hike be beneficial to bulls or bears of cryptocurrencies? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

20,Skybridge Capital Founder: Bitcoin Will Be Legal Tender in Many Latin American Countries,"Mar 14, 2022","The founder of Skybridge Capital has predicted that “bitcoin will be used by many Latin American countries as legal tender over time, not just El Salvador.” He recently doubled down on his $100K bitcoin price prediction but does not currently see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation.
The founder of investment management firm Skybridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, expects more countries to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.“I see bitcoin in its current status as an early adopting technological asset,” he said in an interview with Marketwatch last week. The Skybridge Capital founder elaborated:I think bitcoin will be used by many Latin American countries as legal tender over time, not just El Salvador, but other countries.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year. The Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, predicted in January that two more countries will make BTC legal tender this year.The CEO of Devere Group, Nigel Green, also made a prediction in January. He said three countries will adopt bitcoin as legal tender this year.Meanwhile, the CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform Bitmex, Alex Hoeptner, said in October last year that five countries will accept bitcoin as legal tender by the end of this year.Scaramucci recently doubled down on his bitcoin price prediction of $100K. He also believes that the crypto could reach $500K a coin in the long run.In addition, he expects more than a billion wallets to hold bitcoin by the end of 2025, and the number of BTC users to reach 2.5 to 3 billion in the next decade. The Skybridge Capital founder opined:When it gets there, then I think as a mature asset, we could have a conversation about whether or not it operates as an inflation hedge.Scaramucci has said several times recently that he does not see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation yet.The idea of whether bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation has been a hot topic among investors and fund managers. In March last year, Bank of America said, “Bitcoin has not been particularly compelling as an inflation hedge.” In June, Goldman Sachs said that bitcoin is an alternative inflation hedge to copper, not gold. The investment bank previously described bitcoin as “the retail inflation hedge.”In contrast, global investment bank JPMorgan said in October that bitcoin is the new inflation hedge, noting that institutional investors were dumping gold for bitcoin, seeing the cryptocurrency as a better hedge against inflation.How many countries do you think will adopt bitcoin as legal tender this year? Let us know in the comments section below.

21,‘Ecstasy Kingpin’ From Brockton Forfeits $2.3M in Bitcoin to Massachusetts Law Enforcement,"Mar 14, 2022","A man from Brockton, Massachusetts was sentenced to eight years in prison and forced to forfeit 59 bitcoin worth $2.3 million, after he was caught selling Xanax, ecstasy, and ketamine on the deep web. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins stressed during the announcement that the government has entered the cyber world, and she insists they will “find you and you will be held accountable.”A report stemming from the Boston Herald explains that Massachusetts law enforcement has dealt with a significantly-sized federal forfeiture tied to a “darknet kingpin.” Binh Thanh Le, 25, of Brockton was charged for his Wall Street Market storefront called “Eastsidehigh.” The report notes that Le sold Xanax, ecstasy, and ketamine and he was caught with a large quantity of those drugs, 59 bitcoin, and roughly $114K in cash.Le was 22 when he was busted in June 2019. Massachusetts law enforcement seized 10,000 Xanax pills, 44 pounds of MDMA (ecstasy), and roughly 15 pounds of the anesthesia ketamine. The Boston Herald author Flint McColgan further explained that Le sold his 2018 BMW M3 worth $66.5K for $42.3K at the time of settlement.Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins explained on Saturday that Le will be sentenced to eight years and his bitcoins are now in the hands of law enforcement. “This sentence sends a clear message to Dark Web criminals: the federal government is entering this space. We will find you and you will be held accountable,” Rollins said in a statement. The U.S. Attorney added:Thanks to the incredible work of our law enforcement colleagues, there is one less cybercriminal hiding in the shadows.Le’s arrest was after the popular Wall Street Market (WSM) darknet team was accused of exit scamming. The accusations occurred after Dream Market voluntarily closed down operations, and a mass quantity of darknet market users stemming from Dream Market flocked to WSM. Le was busted in a sting operation at a hotel in Norwood, Massachusetts when his BTC was seized.Le was arrested with two other Brockton men — Steven McCall and Allante Pires. McColgan’s report says that the alleged co-conspiring duo pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Additionally, the report noted that the darknet team packaged products in Lego boxes, which contained bags of pure MDMA (ecstasy), otherwise known as Molly.What do you think about the Brockton man who had to forfeit 59 bitcoin for his dealings on the deep web?

22,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Continues to Consolidate, Despite Encouraging Comments From Elon Musk","Mar 14, 2022","Bitcoin and ETH were once again consolidating to start the week, despite bullish comments from Elon Musk. In a tweet earlier today, Musk said: “I still own & won’t sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge.” Although prices marginally rose, they remain close to recent support levels. The world’s largest cryptocurrency rebounded from its support level to start the week, however it still remained below $40,000. Following a low of $37,680.73 on Sunday, BTC/USD has so far risen to an intraday high of $39,234.62 on Monday.Today’s high comes as markets failed to break out of the floor of $37,600, which was held, as price strength also found a floor. As of writing, the 14-day RSI is under its own resistance point of 47, following a failed break of the 43.61 support. This level was the lowest the RSI has tracked since March 8, and has historically been a point at which bulls begin to pressure bears.However, until we see a true breakout of the current ceiling of 47, BTC will likely continue to consolidate between $37,600 and $39,500.The consolidation of ETH was even more evident to start the week, as prices marginally slipped below recent support. ETH/USD hit an intraday low of $2,503.89 during today’s session, as bears momentarily broke past the $2,550 support level.Although prices have since risen to a high of $2,604.03 today, the recent market pressure has seen ETH consolidate in the form of lower lows. This slight descending trend could be a sign of either a bear trap, where prices give the sentiment of a falling market prior to a significant rebound, or the beginning of further drops in price.We will likely continue to see this uncertainty extend, up until a huge shift in market sentiment finally arises. How long do you expect this consolidation to continue? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

23,"MiCA Amendments Proposed Last Minute Revive Threat of EU Ban on Bitcoin, Report Reveals","Mar 14, 2022","Changes to the EU’s MiCA proposal to regulate crypto markets, suggested shortly before a vote on the package, indicate a bitcoin ban is still a possibility. Despite recently removing wording that would have prohibited coins with energy-intensive mining, some members of the European Parliament are now targeting “unsustainable” cryptocurrencies.A text banning the offering of services for cryptocurrencies relying on the proof-of-work (PoW) mining method was recently deleted from Europe’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislation. The controversial provision had sparked negative reactions from the crypto industry and community.However, attempts to effectively ban cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in the EU have continued. Amendments to MiCA proposed on Friday, days before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) votes on the package, aim to restrict cryptos classified as “unsustainable.”PoW mining is not specifically mentioned this time but the end result is likely to be the same, the German crypto news outlet BTC Echo reported. “Crypto assets shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union,” the new provision reads.Such cryptocurrencies, according to the authors of the amendments, shall be compliant with sustainability requirements. If the proposal is backed by ECON on Monday, when the committee is scheduled to vote on MiCA, bitcoin-related services will be de facto excluded from the scope of regulated activities. Patrick Hansen, head of strategy and growth at Unstoppable Finance, tweeted:1/8 Bad news for #bitcoin & #cryptocurrency in the EU 🚨The POW-ban has basically made its way back into the draft of the European Parliament that will be voted on in the committee on Monday.I just read the latest draft. A quick update 👇@balajis @_pgauthier @BrianBrooksUS— Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) March 12, 2022The consequences of a positive vote would be devastating, the report notes. A complete ban on cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-work concept would paralyze the digital assets market in the EU and encourage the circumvention of laws, weaken consumer protections and ultimately force many businesses in the industry to move out of the Union.Officials and regulators from several member states, including Germany, have in the past few months called for a European ban on the power-hungry PoW mining, citing environmental reasons. Sweden insisted on such a measure, warning that the increasing use of renewable energy to mint bitcoin comes at the expense of climate neutrality goals in other sectors. Non-EU countries like Norway have been considering backing its stance.Do you expect the European Parliament to adopt the recently proposed amendments targeting proof-of-work cryptocurrencies? Tell us in the comments section below.

Currently, the processing power has been coasting along above the 200 exahash per second (EH/s) zone but another difficulty increase is expected to occur in less than four days.Bitcoin’s hashrate slipped two weeks ago on February 27, 2022, to 169 EH/s after touching an all-time high (249 EH/s) on February 15. Following the drop in processing power, bitcoin miners caught a break when the difficulty decreased for the first time in months.On March 3, the difficulty dropped 1.49% lower after six consecutive difficulty increases prior. Currently, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is 27.55 trillion and following the last adjustment, processing power has improved.Bitcoin’s hashrate increased over 15% since the difficulty change and 29% since the hashrate hit 169 EH/s two weeks ago. Currently, the network’s processing power is roughly 218.11 EH/s and over the last ten days its managed to stay above the 200 EH/s range.However, the next epoch mining difficulty adjustment is slated to happen in less than four days and its expected to rise 1.03%. If the rise above 1% is takes place, the mining difficulty will change from 27.55 trillion to 27.83 trillion.Three day hashrate distribution statistics show that Foundry USA has been the top miner over the last 72 hours. The American mining operation has 42.42 EH/s dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain which equates to 21.19 % of today’s hashrate.The second-largest miner in terms of hashrate over the last three days is F2pool with 30.93 EH/s of processing power which represents 15.45% of the global hashrate. At the time of writing, there are 11 known mining pools dedicating SHA256 hashrate toward the BTC chain.There’s 1.33 EH/s or 0.66% of the global hashrate operated by unknown or stealth miners. While the Bitcoin network is once again coasting along at near-record highs, a few other networks have been recorded record highs as well.Monero is coasting along at near all-time highs (ATH) at 2.92 gigahash per second (GH/s) and Ethereum is around 1.04 petahash per second (PH/s). Like Bitcoin, both networks are just below the hashrate ATHs.What do you think about the Bitcoin network’s hashrate increase over the last 10 days and the upcoming difficulty increase?

How do you buy something online? I conquered that. How do you buy things in other countries, and how would you pay for a donut in another country? How do you find an ATM that works on your bitcoin? I want to experiment and learn it all,” the Apple co-founder described, adding:And then bitcoin went way up. Well, I got scared and I sold all my bitcoin except one bitcoin.Wozniak explained that his purpose is “to have enough to play with, experiment with, but not make money on.” However, “two times it’s gone way up and made money,” he noted.The Apple co-founder proceeded to make a prediction about the price of bitcoin:Just recently I think bitcoin is going to go to $100,000.He explained: “I just don’t know where you get that feeling. I can’t put any mathematics to it. I just really feel it from all of the interest. The interest in crypto is so high.”Wozniak further revealed that he recently “put a bunch of money” into an online wallet at the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase. “Pretty much, it’s sitting right where it was right now. [It] went way up, it doubled, and then it halved again,” he shared.While the Apple co-founder has some money in bitcoin, he explained that he’s not an investor.“I don’t invest,” he said. “I’ve never invested in stocks in my life. I’ve never used Apple Stock on the iPhone. Ever. Because why? It goes to my happiness formula.” He opined:I found that my head gets to a peaceful spot where it’s not worrying about everything being up and down, up and down, up and down like day traders.Wozniak has said several good things about bitcoin in the past. Last week, he said Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that is “pure gold mathematics.” In July last year, he said Bitcoin is a “mathematical miracle.”What do you think about Steve Wozniak’s prediction?

26,Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Drop to Lowest Point in 3 Years,"Mar 12, 2022","The number of bitcoin held on exchanges has continued to drop in recent times as the metric suggests crypto advocates are pulling funds off of trading platforms for long-term holding. At the time of writing, 2.32 million bitcoin worth over $90 billion is held on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoin is being pulled off exchanges in greater numbers these days, as the metric shows the amount — 2.32 million bitcoin (BTC) held today — hasn’t been this low in over three years. In fact, three years ago in March, the number of BTC stored on various trading platforms was larger, with roughly 2.73 million bitcoin held. Moreover, the day after the infamous ‘Black Thursday’ on March 11, 2020, exchanges held just over three million BTC, according to cryptoquant.com’s metrics.During the last few weeks, crypto asset prices have been lower and exchange balance metrics really started to slide in August 2021. Today, Coinbase is the largest balance holder in terms of bitcoin with 853,530 BTC according to Bituniverse stats. Bituniverse leverages data from peckshield.com, chain.info, and etherscan.io. The Transparent Balance Rank tool also measures ethereum (ETH) and tether (USDT) balances.Below Coinbase’s balance, Binance holds $18.94 billion in crypto assets. Binance has more than 340,000 BTC according to current metrics and 3.59 million ETH as well. Moreover, Binance holds 1.24 billion of the stablecoin crypto-asset tether. Below the $44.5 billion held by Coinbase and the stashes held by Binance, is Huobi Global’s coffers with $16.12 billion in crypto reserves. Huobi wallets indicate the exchange holds more than 160,000 BTC and 2.13 million ethereum.Crypto funds leaving exchanges is often seen in the crypto space as a good sign for two reasons. For one, the trend suggests that owners are not willing to sell their bitcoin at this time. This means there are fewer funds on the market for whales to dump and it also makes liquidity dry up. Furthermore, in the world of cryptocurrency assets, the golden rule is to hold your own keys and the trend could also suggest users are taking that advice more seriously.What do you think about the balances of bitcoin on exchanges today and how they are currently at the lowest point in three years? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Following strong gains on Tuesday, BTC and ETH have both mainly traded sideways, as price uncertainty grips markets.Bitcoin is down just over 1% as of writing, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to trade below $40,000 to start the weekend.On Saturday, BTC/USD has so far fallen to an intraday low of $38,432.93, following an earlier high of $39,510.69.Today’s high is roughly $1,000 lower than yesterday’s peak, where we saw bitcoin hit a high of over $40,300 in the session.As of writing, the 14-day RSI is still tracking at 47, which is marginally below recent resistance of 48.12.Bulls appear to be waiting for a breakout of this level before truly re-entering, in a similar fashion to March 8, when news of U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order was announced.We will likely continue to see consolidation until a significant amount of price strength enters the market, bullish or bearish.Ethereum is trading close to its support of $2,550 to start the weekend, a position where it has remained during the last few sessions.Following a high of $2,631.49 on Friday, ETH/USD hit an intraday low of $2,536.97 during today’s session, as bears continue to press ahead.Bulls did push back on this however, with ETH now trading at $2,586.08 as of writing, which is 1.41% lower than yesterday’s high.Price momentum maintains a downward trend, as can be seen from both the 10-day and 25-day moving averages.However, the proximity of these means that we could see a rebound, or reversal at any time, which is a prospect that will likely keep bulls on their toes. Could we see some reversal this weekend? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

28,Zapala Free Zone to Offer New Opportunities to Bitcoin Miners in Argentina,"Mar 12, 2022","The Zapala Free Zone, an area located in Neuquen, Argentina that has the objective of incentivizing various productive activities, will receive its first bitcoin mining-related investment this year. The company that will create the power infrastructure for the mining farm aims to generate more than 114 MW of power for mining operations in the first year.Zapala, a free trade zone in the province of Neuquen in Argentina, will get its first bitcoin mining-related investment. For the year 2023, the zone aims to have an installed capacity of 114 MW that will be used for the transformation of the area into a hub for bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining in the region is incentivized in that Zapala, being a free zone, doesn’t charge taxes for using public services.The project, according to a business plan that will be presented to authorities of the province, will contemplate an investment of $20 million, and is expected to be complete for Q1 2023. The managing director of FMI Minecraft, John Blount, stated that this project will be a phased construction that will include “a 100 MW high-density data center for an industrial BTC data processor/miner, expandable to over 1 GW.”Fernando Montero, CEO of the Zapala Free Zone, explained that for this purpose, the company has to lay more than 100 km of gas pipeline in the first year. Montero also elaborated on the benefits of conducting these projects in the zone, stating that:The fact of being a Free Zone gives us the benefit of being exempt from taxes for certain projects, which is why it is a very attractive space for investments related to oil & gas, mining, and technology. There is good accessibility and we are in the heart of the province.Argentina has been in the sights of Bitcoin miners recently as a place with favorable conditions to conduct their business. Bitfarms, another mining company, is building a large mining center in the country that aims to accommodate 55K Bitcoin miners, with a capacity of 210 MW.The main selling point of Argentina is the low cost of the power used to mine bitcoin, according to reports. Bitfarms reportedly obtained a price of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour, described as an “attractive rate” by the CEO of the company, Emiliano Grodzki.What do you think about the bitcoin mining projects to be developed in the Zapala Free Zone?

29,Canadian Police Seize Bitcoin Worth $28 Million From Former Government Employee in Ransomware Case,"Mar 11, 2022","Canada’s police have seized bitcoin worth more than $28 million from a former government employee who has been extradited to the U.S. to “face charges for dozens of ransomware attacks resulting in the payment of tens of millions of dollars in ransoms.”The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Thursday that a former Canadian government employee was extradited the previous day from Canada to the U.S. to “face charges for dozens of ransomware attacks resulting in the payment of tens of millions of dollars in ransoms.”The DOJ detailed that from April through December 2020, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins “conspired to and did intentionally damage a protected computer and transmit a ransom demand in connection with doing so.” The Justice Department launched a coordinated international law enforcement action to disrupt ransomware group Netwalker in January last year.The indictment charges the 34-year-old Canadian from Gatineau, Quebec, “with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and wire fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer arising from his alleged participation in a sophisticated form of ransomware known as Netwalker.”Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division commented:We will use all legally available avenues to pursue seizure and forfeiture of the alleged proceeds of ransomware, whether located domestically or abroad.“The department will not cease to pursue and seize cryptocurrency ransoms, thereby thwarting the attempts of ransomware actors to evade law enforcement through the use of virtual currency,” he continued.Canadian law enforcement officers arrested Vachon-Desjardins in Quebec on Jan. 27 last year at the request of U.S. authorities, the DOJ said Thursday, adding that they proceeded to execute a search warrant at his home.According to the Justice Department:During the search, officers discovered and seized 719 bitcoin, valued at approximately $28,151,582 as of today’s date, and $790,000 in Canadian currency.What do you think about this case?

31,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: More Crypto Price Uncertainty Heading Into the Weekend","Mar 11, 2022","Bitcoin consolidated on Friday, as prices hovered marginally below the $40,000 level. This comes following a volatile day of trading in which BTC fell to its lowest point since Wednesday. Ethereum also remained slightly above its recent support.Bitcoin continued to trade at high levels of uncertainty on Friday, following a volatile few sessions for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. BTC/USD started the day around the $39,300 region, before falling to an intraday low of $38,347.43, which then was followed by a high of $40,081.68.As of writing, bitcoin is now slightly above its price at the start of the day, and is tracking at $39,447.64.Price volatility has heightened in recent days following the news of U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine also creating uneasy market conditions for traders.Looking at the moving averages, both the 10-day and 25-day moving averages continued to intertwine with one another, without showing any clear directional path. However, with prices being close to the support of $37,600, bears may continue to target this point.Although ETH was lower on Friday, its price continued to trade close to the support point of $2,550 heading into the weekend. ETH briefly fell below this support, slipping to an intraday low of $2,534.69 earlier in the session, however as it has in sessions passed, this floor held firm, bouncing to a high of $2,664.56.As discussed yesterday, bearish sentiment seems persistent with ETH, as prices refuse to move away from the region of support, which could eventually lead to a break out.Should this happen, the $2,350 level could be a potential destination for bears looking to short the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.Will we finally see a sustained movement in price this weekend?

32,Mega Awakening — Whale Transfers 429 'Sleeping Bitcoin' From 2010 Worth Over $16.8 Million,"Mar 10, 2022","After tapping a 24-hour high at $42,592 per unit, the price of bitcoin lost the gains it gathered on Wednesday, sliding more than 5% during Thursday morning’s trading sessions. Meanwhile, as crypto prices fluctuated, an odd bitcoin transaction from 2010 was transferred at 1:45 a.m. (UTC) moving 429 bitcoin worth $16.8 million.Crypto prices have been shaky during the last few days amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased pessimism toward the global economy’s future. After falling to the $38,300 range two days ago, bitcoin’s price rebounded on Wednesday, jumping to a high of $42,592 per unit.However, the bullish sentiment did not last too long and BTC’s value moved back into the $38K territory on Thursday. While the market has been volatile, an old-school whale from 2010 decided to transfer a large sum of bitcoins.The transfer, stemming from the bitcoin address “17QBW,” was approximately 489.091 BTC. The large transaction was caught by the blockchain parser Btcparser.com when it was processed at block height 726,641 at 1:45 a.m. (UTC) on March 10.The 429 BTC worth $16.8 million originally derived from a transaction processed 11 years and four months ago, on October 28, 2010. The transaction derived from a sender that held 1,000 bitcoin that were moved from one address to another address on October 20, 2010.The original address that the 1,000 BTC came from processed a number (5,111 bitcoin) of BTC between September 6, 2010 and July 12, 2011. The 429 BTC spent on March 10, 2022, was originally obtained at the same time the remaining 510.91 BTC was sent to the bitcoin address “1NS7i.” While the owner waited more than a decade to transfer the 429 BTC, the 510.91 BTC was spent two days later on Halloween (October 31, 2010) that year.There hasn’t been a major awakening of 2010 bitcoins like the 429 BTC transaction in a long while. Bitcoin.com News has been investigating a mega bitcoin whale that has spent tens of thousands of so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ and the last time we saw the mega whale was on November 10, 2021. On that day, BTC reached a lifetime price high at $69K per unit and that specific mega whale moved 1,000 decade-old bitcoins.While the 429 BTC is not as large as the aforementioned mega whale transfer, it’s much larger than the typical old-school block subsidy transfers that happen to be a single or maybe two blocks. A visual perspective of the outbound transactions stemming from the “17QBW” address shows the possibility that some of the coins processed at 726,641 may have been sent to the trading platform Coinbase.A number of other transactions show fractions of the coins were moved to unknown addresses, none of which were Segwit-based (Bech32) as the two largest outputs were sent to legacy addresses.What do you think about the 429 so-called ‘sleeping bitcoin’ spent on March 10? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

33,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: Crypto Prices Fall Lower as Markets Continue to Digest Biden's Executive Order","Mar 10, 2022","Less than 24 hours after U.S. President Biden’s executive order, cryptocurrency markets were back in the red, as the global market cap fell by over 5%. Bitcoin was once again trading below $40,000, with ETH hovering marginally above $2,500.As the smoke clears following yesterday’s executive order, crypto traders seem to be coming to terms with what this announcement could mean for the space long-term. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is currently down by over 7% on Thursday, wiping out all of yesterday’s gains.Following Wednesday’s peak of $42,465.67, BTC/USD has so far fallen to an intraday low of $38,832.94 earlier in the session.This has come as the 14-day RSI has also fallen back below its support of 47.4, after moving to as high as 54.6 only yesterday.Volatility in price strength shows the degree of market uncertainty that currently exists, as traders seem fearful to hold on to gains, and instead accept profits.With momentum once again changing, many expect further consolidation in price, which could be confirmed if BTC hits its floor of $37,600 in upcoming sessions.Wednesday’s gains in ethereum were also wiped out during Thursday’s session, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency trades 5.17% lower today.As of writing, ETH/USD was trading at $2,593.45, and this comes after climbing to as high as $2,756.06 less than 24 hours ago.ETH has so far fallen to an intraday low of $2,566.19 during Thursday’s session, which is marginally above its long-term floor of $2,550.This decline to support will likely captivate bears from sustaining recent pressure in hopes of a breakout to the lower level of $2,400.Should this happen, we may see the RSI move from its current position of 48, to its own floor of 42.Is it inevitable that we will see further downside moves in ETH?

34,"African Crypto Startup, Basqet Launches Payment Gateway to Enable Businesses Accept Bitcoin - Goes Live With 118 Businesses and $1.3 Million in Transaction Volume","Mar 10, 2022","PRESS RELEASE. Recently, blockchain payments startup Basqet announced the launch of its cryptocurrency payments gateway which will allow businesses to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment.Basqet said it is launching a public beta and will be going live with 118 businesses already signed up to start accepting payments in Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies.Prior to the launch of its beta launch, the team at Basqet also revealed that they had done about $1.3 million dollars in transactions with a handful of businesses.According to Bunmi Eleshin, Senior Product Manager at Basqet “we are creating a missing link between people who hold cryptocurrency and businesses who want to accept crypto as a means of payment. And we are doing it without merchants having to experience a loss due to crypto’s price volatility”.Since Bitcoin entered mainstream media there has been a lot of discussion about crypto being the evolution of money, and Basqet could take crypto adoption steps ahead as people will be able to shop and pay for services using crypto besides using it for speculation.Although one of the biggest concerns around crypto payments is the rapid price fluctuation that crypto is known for. According to Basqet, they resolve this is by allowing merchants to accept crypto as payment and get settled in US dollars, crypto, and over 5 other local African currencies without experiencing any volatility from cryptocurrency. So when a merchant is selling a product for $20 they will always receive the equivalent value in the currency they choose regardless of crypto’s price volatility.Cryptocurrency payment gateways like Basqet are similar to the likes of Stripe in the US as well as Flutterwave and Paystack in Africa but for crypto. They have the potential of enabling freelancers, business owners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and fintech to accept different cryptos as donations, payments or deposits in over 120 countries. Also, they could help cut regular transaction fees by more than 60% with zero chargebacks.The team at Basqet also stated that for its beta-launch merchants will be able to accept cryptos including; USDT, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin with several more to be added over the next few weeks.Merchants that sign up for Basqet’s beta launch will have 3 ways to accept crypto; payment link, payment button, and Basqet API.In its press release, Basqet mentioned that without a website businesses can use the payment link to accept crypto payment. Adding that it only takes 10 minutes for a business to sign up generate a payment link and send it via WhatsApp, Instagram or any other channel to their customer.About Basqet
Basqet is a fintech that is revolutionizing payments using blockchain technology. They provide African businesses with a cryptocurrency payment gateway that enables them to accept cryptocurrency payments and get settled in US Dollars and their local currency. This is a press release.

35,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Rallies to 1-Week High Above $42,000","Mar 9, 2022","Following an extended period of bearish pressure, bitcoin’s price surged on Wednesday, as bulls returned to the market. ETH was also higher, climbing to a five-day high in the process. Bitcoin finally broke above its recent price ceiling on hump-day, leading to the world’s largest cryptocurrency snapping a six-day losing streak. Following a low of $38,235.74 earlier in today’s session, BTC/USD surged beyond its resistance level at $40,000 as crypto prices rebounded across the board. As of writing, BTC/USD is up nearly 9% on the day, hitting an intraday high of $42,352.69 in the process.This is the highest level BTC has traded since last Friday, when prices were on their way to a now support level of $37,600. Wednesday’s surge in price comes as the 14-day RSI broke free of its own resistance point of 46.70, and is currently tracking at 55.10.Should price strength continue to climb, bulls will likely attempt to recapture the $45,000 ceiling for the first time since March 2nd.ETH, which was in a streak of consolidation for the last four sessions, finally moved away from this floor, and is up by over 6%.As of writing, ETH/USD is trading at $2,739.56, which is marginally lower than today’s peak of $2,761.80.Looking at the chart, today’s surge has taken the price of ethereum close to its interim resistance point of $2,800.This will likely act as the main hurdle stopping bulls from reaching the $3,000 level, as well as the upcoming RSI ceiling of 50.75.Bulls will likely have been buoyed by 10-day and 25-day moving averages, which look set to cross imminently. Could we see ETH at $3,000 this week? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

36,"Bitcoin Miner Hive to Purchase Intel Mining Chips, Firm Reveals a 100 MW Deployment Deal in Texas","Mar 9, 2022","On March 7, the publicly-listed mining firm Hive Blockchain Technologies announced the company inked a deal with Intel to purchase new ASIC mining chips. Additionally, Hive has formed an agreement with an original design manufacturer (ODM) and a non-binding letter of intent with Compute North. Hive said the company plans to deploy 100 MW of mining capacity to Compute North’s renewable energy facilities in Texas.The blockchain company and mining operation Hive (TSX.V: HIVE) (Nasdaq: HIVE) has revealed it has entered a supply agreement with Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC). Hive will obtain Intel’s new ASIC mining chips that will be leveraged in custom-built equipment made for the company. The blockchain firm says it has a manufacturing agreement with an ODM that specializes in “electronics manufacturing.”“Hive’s engineering team will draw on its expertise in hardware and software implementation and will work closely with Intel and the ODM partner on the systems integration,” Hive’s announcement notes. “These miners are expected to be delivered over a period of one year starting in the second half of calendar 2022, the effect of which, if they are all installed, would be an expected increase of up to 95% in our aggregate Bitcoin mining hashrate from 1.9 exahash per second.”In addition to the deal with Intel, Hive detailed it closed another agreement with Compute North in order to deploy a 100 MW mining center in Texas. Frank Holmes, Hive’s executive chairman, said the Compute North team “shares the same commitment to using renewable energy that Hive has adhered to since its listing as the world’s first publicly traded crypto-miner.”Hive says that further details about the 100 MW facility will be announced in the future. Last year, Hive purchased a great deal of mining rigs from Canaan and in mid-October it expanded its data center campus in New Brunswick, Canada, with 40 MW of capacity. The same month, Hive acquired another 6,500 mining rigs from Canaan. Hive holds a balance of 2,374 bitcoin (BTC) as of February 28, 2022, and the company produced 244.4 BTC last month.Moreover, Hive joins firms like Griid, Argo Blockchain, and Jack Dorsey’s Block (formerly Square) that have plans to acquire Intel’s ASIC chips. Intel revealed its new mining chips in mid-February and claimed the circuits will deliver 1,000x better performance than current competitors. Later, at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) last month, Intel gave the event attendees a sneak peak at the ‘Bonanza Mine BMZ1’ blockchain accelerator mining chip and the ‘Bonanza Mine BMZ2’ as well.What do you think about Hive’s plans to purchase Intel ASIC chips and the 100 MW facility in Texas with Compute North?

37,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH, BTC Remain Lower as Commodity Prices Hit New Highs","Mar 8, 2022","Cryptocurrencies were once again trading lower on Tuesday, as markets were mainly focused on surging commodity prices. Crude oil climbed to a 14-year high of over $130 per barrel, whilst gold was fast approaching its own all-time high. Bitcoin was trading below $40,000 on Tuesday, as the volatility surrounding the war in Ukraine continued to impact the world’s largest cryptocurrency.Following a low of $37,260.20 during yesterday’s session, BTC/USD had a higher low of $37,851 so far today.The price has since rallied, with bitcoin hitting an intraday high of $39,230, which is 0.80% lower than Monday’s peak.This move comes as the newly found floor of $37,600 once again held firm, after several attempts at breakouts during last night’s session. Despite remaining marginally oversold, and currently tracking at 45.6, the 14-day RSI looks to be headed for the 47 level, which has acted as resistance in the past.Should price strength reach this level, BTC/USD would likely be trading close to the $40,000 ceiling, with a breakout likely to inspire bulls to return.The sentiment of consolidation was once again present in ETH, as it continued to hover marginally above its long-term floor of $2,550.As of writing, ETH/USD was trading at $2,575.98, which is 1.65% lower than Monday’s peak of $2,634.25.Looking at the chart, the 14-day Relative Strength Index is tracking at 42.62, after a slight break beyond resistance of 41.80.Similar to February 27, history has shown us that large swings in price strength tend to occur from this point, however bulls will likely remain sidelined until we see a slight shift in momentum.This could come if the 10-day and 25-day moving averages cross, which seems like an inevitability due to their current proximity. Is an upwards cross of moving averages enough to start a new bull run in ETH? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

38,Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak on Crypto: Bitcoin Is 'Pure-Gold Mathematics',"Mar 7, 2022","Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says Bitcoin is “the only one that’s pure-gold mathematics.” He is skeptical of most other cryptocurrencies. In addition, Wozniak is a fan of the metaverse but is less enthusiastic about non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with the Insider, published last week. He said:There’s so many cryptocurrencies that come out now. Everybody has a way to create a new one, and you have a celebrity star with it. It seems like they’re just collecting a bunch of money from people who want to invest at the very earliest stage, when it’s worth pennies.Wozniak also noted that some people buy cryptocurrencies because they are not aware of the potential windfalls. “Then they just fold,” he said.While he’s a fan of the metaverse, he’s less enthusiastic about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies, the publication conveyed. He said that for the most part, they are “so up in the air,” stressing that they have a track record of being “rip-offs.”Wozniak has had first-hand experience battling crypto scams. In July 2020, he sued Youtube and Google for promoting bitcoin giveaway scams using his name and likeness. However, a judge ruled last year that “Youtube and its parent, Google LLC, are protected by the federal law that shields internet platforms from responsibility for content posted by users.”Bitcoin giveaway schemes continue to scam investors on various social media platforms. Wozniak is not the only one scammers like to feature. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, his company Spacex, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, and many other celebrities have also been found in fake crypto giveaways.In February, the reality TV series Unicorn Hunters, which Wozniak is involved in, introduced its own cryptocurrency called unicoin. Unicorn Hunters features a group of investors called the “Circle of Money” and entrepreneurs who pitch their businesses in search of investment funds. Wozniak is one of the judges on the show.Unicoin provides holders with dividends and equity positions from the portfolio of startups that the show invests in. The Apple co-founder described:It’s really opening up the world of startup investment to the masses.Wozniak explained that unicoin is more conservative than most other cryptocurrencies because it is backed by professional investment decisions. “A token’s flaky on its own. It could even be worth zero,” Wozniak said. “I’m hoping unicoin’s very successful, but at least it’s not based on zero, just based on words and talk. It’s really based on the outcome of investments.”Regarding bitcoin, the Apple co-founder said the cryptocurrency is:[The] only one that’s pure-gold mathematics.This was not the first time Wozniak praised Bitcoin. In July last year, he said Bitcoin is a “mathematical miracle.” In October, he said that the largest crypto is “mathematical purity.”However, Wozniak is concerned that governments could disallow bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “The trouble is governments will never allow it to be out of their control. If it got to the point where everything is being done in crypto and didn’t pass through governments for observation and taxation and all that, governments would just disallow it. They wouldn’t give up their power,” he warned.What do you think about Steve Wozniak’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

40,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Consolidates, Following Turbulent Weekend of Trading","Mar 7, 2022","Recent declines in the world’s two largest cryptocurrencies eased to start the week, as both seemed to have found their respective floors. Bitcoin consolidated losses during Monday’s session, while ETH continued to trade sideways. Following a drop to a one-week low below $38,000 on Sunday, the price of bitcoin rebounded to start the week, as a support point seems to have finally been found. BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $37,577 earlier in today’s session, which was its lowest point since February 28, however prices have since moved away from this point.As of writing, BTC/USD is trading 0.59% higher, at a rate of $39,114.31, following an earlier high of $39,277.14This rise in price comes as a result of bulls who bought yesterday’s drop, once the price found what looks to be a sustainable floor. From the chart, history shows us that on February 4 and 28, a significant number of buyers entered the market.This resulted in large price swings that helped form a bullish engulfing pattern, which wiped away between 2-3 days worth of drops. Many now wait to see if history will repeat itself. ETH continued its consolidation around the $2,600 range to start the week, as price movement in the world’s second largest crypto was largely muted. Following three consecutive days of declines, ethereum appeared to find its floor at the $2,550 level on March 4, and since then, has mainly hovered above this point. Despite falling to an intraday low of $2,507.11 earlier today, ETH/USD has rebounded, and as of writing is trading at $2,649.07.The 14-day RSI also shows that price strength is marginally higher, and is currently tracking at 43.8, after briefly falling below its floor of 41.30 this past weekend.Although bulls are likely lurking, some bears also remain, with the $2,400 floor a target for some who still believe more declines could be imminent. Will we see this $2,400 floor hit this week? Or are we ready for a price surge? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

41,Wharton Professor Urges the Fed to 'Bite the Bullet' and Defend the US Dollar — Warns About Bitcoin Taking Over,"Mar 6, 2022","A finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has warned of “bitcoin taking over.” He added that the Fed “has been terribly wrong over the last year” about inflation and must now act to defend the U.S. dollar.
Wharton’s finance professor Jeremy Siegel shared his view on inflation, “bitcoin taking over,” and the need for the Federal Reserve to defend the U.S. dollar in an interview with CNBC Friday.Siegel is Russell E. Palmer Professor Emeritus of Finance at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. His research focuses on demographics, financial markets, long-run asset returns, and macroeconomics.Commenting on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicating last week that the first rate hike will be in March and will likely be 25 basis points, Siegel criticized that the Fed is already behind and should be making a more aggressive move.“They’re going to have to do much more than that … I’m actually disappointed that Chairman Powell did not look at the history that this is not a time for us to slow down,” the Wharton finance professor stressed, elaborating:The Fed has been terribly wrong over the last year. I mean, all this temporary inflation. Look at the protection they did for inflation last year — so way below what actually happened all the way to December.He said last week that it would be a “big policy mistake” for the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes because of the situation in Ukraine.While stating that “Jay Powell is a very good man” and “a good communicator,” Professor Siegel stressed: “The Fed has been very wrong and they are going to have to catch up and they really have to admit they’ve got to bite the bullet here.”Regarding bitcoin, he urged the Federal Reserve to take action to defend the U.S. dollar, emphasizing:We talk about bitcoin taking over. We’ve got to defend the dollar.The professor has been noting the rise in popularity of bitcoin for quite some time. In January, he said that BTC has replaced gold as an inflation hedge for millennials.He also warned that the Federal Reserve is “so far behind the curve that we have a lot of inflation that is embedded in,” predicting that “The Fed is going to have to hike many more times than what the market expects.”What do you think about Professor Siegel’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

42,Skybridge Capital Founder Doubles Down on $100K Bitcoin Prediction — Expects BTC to Reach $500K Long-Term,"Mar 6, 2022","The founder of Skybridge Capital has doubled down on his $100K bitcoin price prediction. He also believes that bitcoin could reach $500K a coin in the long run. “But we’ve got some work to do here from a regulatory perspective,” he stressed. The executive also advised how an average investor should get into bitcoin.
The founder of investment management firm Skybridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, talked about the future outlook for bitcoin Friday in an interview with Melissa Francis on Magnifi by TIFIN.Scaramucci expected the price of BTC to reach $100,000 by the end of last year. However, he admitted that he “did not assess the regulatory environment appropriately” after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs).“I thought once you had the bitcoin futures [ETFs], you’d end up with the cash pretty immediately. Too much political headwind for that,” he explained. Instead, BTC got corrected down to the $40,000 level from its all-time high of $68,892 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Nonetheless, the Skybridge Capital founder believes that the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000 this year. He opined:Could it get there this year? Yes. Is it likely to get there over two years? I’m very confident of that. But we’ve got some work to do here from a regulatory perspective.“We got to get the markets to calm down a little bit. We’ve got to get through Covid. But it’s not going anywhere,” he stressed.The Skybridge Capital founder was also asked what he would do if he were an average investor who has not invested in crypto. “I would buy some,” he promptly replied. However, he added, “I would average in.”While cautioning that there will be volatility, Scaramucci noted:The only way you can handle technology like this is to dollar-cost average and buy a little every month.Regarding what percentage of a paycheck an average investor should put into bitcoin, Scaramucci advised: “I would pick a number that you are comfortable with and buy a little every month.” He recommends putting between 1% and 4%.“I put 4% of Skybridge money into bitcoin,” he shared. “I started off with a 4% cost position … If you talked to me at the peak, it ended up being 22%,” he detailed, adding that it then “traded down to about a 15% position.”He continued: “I think you’ve got to be part of that. I think it would be a mistake to be under-invested or zero-invested in blockchain and cryptocurrency.”Scaramucci also commented on how high the price of bitcoin could reach long term, reiterating his previous prediction that BTC could reach $500,000 a coin.Noting that “This is early adopting technology,” the Skybridge Capital executive warned: “This will be very volatile. There’ll be periods of time where bitcoin will crash, down 50 plus percent.” Nonetheless, he emphasized:But if you’re willing to zoom out and look at the long term chart and look at the adoption story, could bitcoin get to a half a million dollars a coin? I believe it will.Scaramucci has been bullish on bitcoin for quite some time. In November last year, he encouraged investors to start buying BTC, stating: “This is very, very early for people … I’m trying to do my best to explain to them why they need to own this right now.”What do you think about Scaramucci’s advice? Let us know in the comments section below.

43,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Prepares for Rally, While BTC Seeks Support","Mar 6, 2022","Bitcoin remained under the $40,000 level on Sunday, as bears continued to pressure cryptocurrency markets. This pressure also kept ethereum lower, with the world’s second-largest crypto hovering around its long-term support level.Sunday saw the price of bitcoin (BTC) trade lower for a fifth consecutive session, as it was unable to shake off recent bearish pressure.BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $38,211.65 on Sunday, which was around $500 lower than its bottom to start the weekend.Today’s move sees BTC fall to its lowest point since February 28, and is fast approaching its long-term floor of $37,600.As a result of recent declines in price, mid-term momentum in the market has shifted, with the 25-day (blue) moving average crossing below the 10-day (red) MA.This is the first time since December 27 that we have seen such a cross, with the 25-day crossing below the 10-day from an upwards position.Such a shift in momentum could signal even more declines in price in upcoming sessions.Although ethereum (ETH) was also lower on Sunday, its decline appeared to look more like consolidation than an actual selloff.Following a low of $2,587.75 on Saturday, ETH/USD had a bottom of $2,595.57 during today’s session thus far.This shows that prices are somewhat climbing, despite the onslaught of bearish action currently taking place in crypto markets. A reason why we could be seeing this from ethereum and not bitcoin (BTC), is that currently the $2,550 support in ETH/USD seems well defined, as bitcoin still looks to be in search of its floor.Looking at the chart, the same can be said for the 14-day Relative Strength Index, which also has found support at 41.80, helping to give bulls a firm ground on which to stand on with potential future positions. Is ethereum setting up for a strong rebound in next week’s session? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

44,Bitcoin Miner Mawson Inks Hosting Deals With Celsius Mining and Foundry Digital,"Mar 5, 2022","The bitcoin mining operation Mawson Infrastructure Group (MIGI) has started to make hosting deals with key players in the mining industry. On March 1, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documents show that Mawson signed a 100-megawatt (MW) co-location agreement with Celsius Mining. Three days later, Mawson announced a 12-megawatt (MW) co-location deal with Foundry Digital.Mawson Infrastructure Group is making moves within the bitcoin mining industry as the company has recently partnered with Celsius Mining and Foundry Digital. Bitcoin.com News has reported on the bitcoin mining operation Mawson in the past when the firm acquired 11,760 next-generation A1246 ASIC Avalonminers from Canaan.Just prior to the mining equipment acquisition, Mawson rebranded and changed the company’s name from Wize Pharma to Mawson Infrastructure Group. The company rebranded at the end of March 2021 and at the time, Mawson CEO James Manning said the move toward bolstering digital asset infrastructure globally was similar to the explorer and geologist Sir Douglas Mawson’s Antarctic exploration.On March 1, 2022, Mawson inked a deal with Celsius Mining, the crypto lending firm Celsius Network’s mining subsidiary. SEC documents show Celsius Mining will provide a mining facility in order to host the 100-megawatt (MW) co-location.“The industry is experiencing a shortage of energy and energy infrastructure — having focused as a business on ‘Infrastructure First’ long ago, this enables us to take on strategic customers in our hosting co-location business,” Mawson’s CEO Manning said in a statement. “Demand and inbound [inquiry] for hosting continue to rise, and we look forward to updating stockholders on this front further in due course.”After Mawson inked the deal with Celsius Mining, the company announced a partnership with Foundry Digital LLC. Mawson’s announcement said that the “12-megawatt hosting customer [is] to have first mining hardware units online end of Q1, 2022.”The company plans to deploy the mining rigs inside its “proprietary Modular Data Centre (MDC) technology at its facilities in the United States.” Foundry operates the mining pool Foundry USA, which has been the top mining pool in terms of hashrate for most of 2022.What do you think about Mawson’s co-location mining deals with Foundry and Celsius?

45,Fast-Food Chain Shake Shack Trials Bitcoin Rewards for Customers Using Cash App,"Mar 5, 2022","The American fast-food restaurant chain Shake Shack is giving bitcoin rewards to customers leveraging Cash App’s debit card payment rail, Cash Card. According to Shake Shack, participants will get 15% of their purchase back in the form of bitcoin, and the crypto promotion will last until mid-March.The fast-food restaurant chain Shake Shack is experimenting with cryptocurrency rewards as the company has partnered with Block Inc. in order to give away bitcoin (BTC). The announcement stems from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report authored by Ann-Marie Alcántara and Shake Shack explained the move is meant to lure younger customers.Executives at the burger chain told Alcántara that while it’s looking to attract millennial and Gen Z-age customers, Shake Shack is also “interested in more cryptocurrency options.” The offer will give Shake Shack consumers the ability to receive 15% of their purchase back, but paid in bitcoin. Essentially, customers need to leverage Block’s Cash Card and Cash Boost system in order to get the BTC reward.Jay Livingston, Shake Shack’s chief marketing officer, told the WSJ reporter that the fast-food restaurant chain has not seen demand for crypto payments. However, Livingston said the experiment with the Block’s Cash App is a good way to determine whether the restaurant should accept digital assets.“You’re always trying to place your bets on those things that truly will be meaningful and not waste resources on the ones that won’t,” Livingston told Alcántara. “If we just started taking crypto right now at our kiosk, it would have very low adoption. But through someone like Cash App, who’s been promoting it, you will get some more people that want it and that also want to learn,” the Shake Shack CMO noted.Shake Shack is not the first to test the waters with crypto solutions as Burger King (BK) and Robinhood gave a single dogecoin (DOGE) reward to BK consumers for spending $5. Robinhood and BK also distributed 20 bitcoin and 200 ether during the rewards event timeline.McDonald’s has yet to trial crypto payments but the fast-food giant has been testing non-fungible token (NFT) technology. For instance, McDonald’s introduced the cult-classic “McRib” NFT collectible last November, and McDonald’s France tweeted out images of NFTs in April.What do you think about Shake Shack experimenting with cryptocurrency rewards?

46,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Falls Below $40,000 to Start Weekend","Mar 5, 2022","Bitcoin has fallen below $40,000 to start the weekend, as cryptocurrency markets extend recent losses. ETH was also lower on Saturday, falling to its lowest point this week in the process. BTC fell for its fourth consecutive session on Saturday, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped below its long-term support level.The price of BTC/USD fell below its $40,000 floor during the session, hitting an intraday low of $38,777.04 in the process. As of writing, BTC is down 5.27% on the day, and is currently trading at $39,151.54, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 45.4. This decline in price strength comes as the floor of 47 within the RSI indicator was broken, and is now trading at its lowest since last Sunday.As prices continue to fall, traders are naturally looking to find a stable floor, which appears to be around the $37,600 region. However, as established on Friday, a rebound could also be imminent, as bulls historically have lived in the current price range. Unlike bitcoin, ETH appears to have found its floor to start the weekend, despite also falling to its lowest level in the last seven days.Earlier in today’s session, ETH/USD hit an intraday low of $2,587.75, however these losses have somewhat eased, and ethereum is now trading at $2,645.77.This is marginally lower than today’s peak of $2,705.25, however as Saturday’s session matures, many remain hopeful of increases in price.The floor of $2,550 seems to be the target of bears, which have been firmly present since prices were trading at the $3,000 resistance point.History has shown that bulls tend to rally at the current level, as seen the last few times we were at this support point around $2,600.Could we see prices recover heading into Sunday?

47,"Devere CEO Bullish on Bitcoin, Predicts BTC Hitting $50,000 This Month","Mar 4, 2022","The CEO of Devere Group has predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $50,000 by the end of this month. He explained that geopolitical tensions from the Russia-Ukraine war and institutional investment are key drivers boosting the price of bitcoin. He also said, “the dollar’s reserve status could, ultimately, be in jeopardy.”
The CEO of Devere Group, Nigel Green, has predicted that bitcoin’s price will reach $50,000 by the end of this month. Devere is an independent financial advisory and asset management firm headquartered in the UAE.The executive said on Tuesday after the price of bitcoin surged more than $6,000 in 24 hours:As it currently stands, I can see no reason why this price momentum should falter. I think we can expect to see bitcoin hit $50,000 by the end of this month.However, he noted that it is “too early to say” when the price of bitcoin will revisit last year’s all-time highs. Based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets, BTC peaked at $68,892 on Nov. 9.Green believes that “It’s not that big a leap from $50K to $68K.” He emphasized: “The world and the crypto market are moving at an accelerated rate in recent times. It’s certainly not out of the realms of possibility.” At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $39,007.The Devere executive sees two key drivers boosting the price of bitcoin: geopolitical tensions and institutional investment.He explained that the war between Russia and Ukraine “has caused significant financial upheaval.” It has driven individuals, businesses and government agencies globally to look for “alternatives to traditional systems,” he detailed.“As banks close, ATMs run out of money, threats of personal savings being taken to pay for war, and the major international payments system SWIFT is weaponized, amongst other factors, the case for a viable, decentralized, borderless, tamper-proof, unconfiscatable monetary system has been laid bare,” the chief executive further opined, elaborating:And as alternatives, such as crypto, prove to be credible and workable, the dollar’s reserve status could, ultimately, be in jeopardy.“Savvy investors know this and will be further increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies before prices rise further,” he predicted.The Devere boss further predicted: “As more and more institutional investors take control of the sector, credibility increases, trading volumes go up and volatility goes down.”Emphasizing that the current Russia-Ukraine crisis has highlighted bitcoin’s key traits, Green concluded:This is why bitcoin is now the 14th most valuable currency in the world. I expect it to jump further still up the rankings in coming months.Green is not the only one who sees a positive outlook for bitcoin. Veteran investor and fund manager Bill Miller said this week that the situation in Russia is “very bullish for bitcoin.”What do you think about the prediction by Devere’s CEO?

48,Bitcoin Miners Catch a Break as Mining Difficulty Drops for the First Time in 3 Months,"Mar 4, 2022","Bitcoin miners got a small break on March 3, after the network’s mining difficulty shifted downward for the first time since November 28, 2021. Bitcoin’s hashrate has remained high meandering between 180 to 220 exahash per second (EH/s) over the last week, but the leading crypto asset’s price has shed more than 3% during the last 24 hours.Bitcoin’s hashrate remains high and at the time of writing, the network’s processing power is around 189.56 EH/s or 189,564,917,409,516,800,000 hashes per second (H/s). The hashrate has been coasting along at 180 to 220 EH/s during the last seven days following a small drop in hashpower that took place five days ago.At that time, estimates expected the mining difficulty to increase by 1.18% to 27.64 trillion. However, the March 3, 2022, difficulty change at block height 725,760, decreased for the first time in months. In fact, the last mining difficulty decrease the network experienced was recorded 96 days ago on November 28, 2021. The decrease on Thursday was a 1.49% change lower bringing the difficulty down to 27.55 trillion.While it’s not much of a change, it does make it 1.49% less difficult for a bitcoin miner to find a BTC block subsidy often referred to as a block reward. Prior to the downward shift, the network saw a total of six consecutive mining difficulty increases, which made it much harder for mining participants to find block rewards.The 1.49% difficulty drop on March 3 is helpful but at the same time, 24-hour statistics show at the time of writing, BTC’s value has lost 3.8% against the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin’s (BTC) current fiat value makes Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro (110 TH/s), Microbt’s Whatsminer M30S++ (112 TH/s), and Canaan’s Avalonminer 1246 (90 TH/s) profits drop lower than last week.The aforementioned mining rigs get $8.24 to $12.75 per day, using current BTC prices and paying $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for electricity. Mining devices like Innosilicon’s T2 Turbo+ (32 TH/s) mining rig, Bitmain’s Antminer S11 (20.5 TH/s) are not seeing a profit today, with current BTC prices and paying $0.12 per kWh.Over the last three days, Foundry USA has been the top mining pool globally with 18.41% of the global hashrate, and roughly 36.49 EH/s of processing power. The U.S. mining operation Foundry USA has been a top miner for weeks on end this year, and the pool has obtained 79 block rewards over the last 72 hours.The second-largest mining pool over the three-day span is Bitmain’s Antpool with 15.62% of the global hashrate. Antpool has found 67 blocks in 72 hours leveraging 30.95 EH/s of processing power. There are approximately 11 known BTC mining pools today, while unknown hashrate commands 1.64% of the world’s BTC hashpower, with around 3.24 EH/s of SHA256 processing power.What do you think about Bitcoin’s mining difficulty dropping 1.49% lower?

49,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Approaching $40,000 Support on NFP Day","Mar 4, 2022","Following three consecutive sessions of declines, BTC was fast approaching its support level of $40,000 on Friday, as markets prepared for February’s nonfarm payrolls report. This came as ETH also fell lower, and is approaching its own floor of $2,500 in the process. BTC bulls have been few and far between over the last few days, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency faced growing pressure from bears.This pressure came following Tuesday’s climb to the resistance level of $45,000, which then triggered an onslaught of short sellers, who entered the market.As of writing, BTC is down almost 6% on the day, and is currently trading at $40,845.52, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 49.5. Looking at the chart, BTC now appears to be heading for support, which is located at $40,056, with the RSI heading for its own floor at 47.The mid-term moving average of 25-days (blue) also seems to have once again changed course, with momentum now shifting downwards. As of now, this bearish pressure seems as though it will inevitably take prices to the floor. However, once there, market uncertainty could potentially kick in.Similar to bitcoin, ETH is also down for a third straight day, with the price of the world’s second-largest crypto down 7% as of writing.Earlier in today’s session, ETH/USD hit intraday high of $2,891.03, however these gains were short lived, and ethereum is now trading at $2,702.07.This is marginally higher than today’s low of $2,680.50, however as Friday’s session matures, many expect further drops in price.The floor of $2,550 seems to be the target of bears, which have been firmly present since prices were trading at the $3,000 resistance point.Price strength has now also moved into oversold territory, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 44.8. From the looks of it, though, the 39 level could be a realistic floor.Could we see prices fall further heading into the weekend? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

50,Crypto’s Sanction-Slipping Power: Why Bitcoin’s Neutrality Is Its Greatest Humanitarian Asset,"Mar 4, 2022","Decentralized networks such as Bitcoin’s don’t know national allegiance, they only know math. And when you’re trying to get your savings out of an ATM, or send a payment to relatives in a war-torn environment, someone else’s politics is the last thing you want standing in the way of you and your loved ones’ well-being — regardless of what colors may be on the flag waving above your head. There are no winners in war. Bankers and politicians start them, and everyday individuals like you and I are told to suffer, fight, kill one another, and die.Picture this: You live in Russia. The value of your money — the ruble — is tumbling. What’s more frightening are the long lines forming in front of ATMs and banks, and the confusion at public transportation hubs as major corporations like Google and Apple are restricting services, while major banks are cut off from the SWIFT payments network.While you are completely against war, and even have relatives in the Ukraine, according to many media reports you are their sworn enemy. Even the institutions you somewhat trust, such as forward-thinking cryptocurrency exchanges, are being pressured to “sabotage ordinary users” by top-ranking government officials. This is the nature of sanctions.Luckily, true, decentralized crypto is still available as an option to move and preserve value. Just have a look at all the honking for peace that recently went on in Ottawa, Canada. In the Ukraine, too, as your relatives seek shelter in the midst of a conflict they never asked for, they are being aided by crypto donations that aren’t subject to arbitrary borders drawn by politicians. Heck, the government itself is asking. Crypto is a tool. It can be used by anyone, for better or for worse.No matter what the major news outlets are shouting about, or which side is viewed as right or wrong, you can continue to control your money.The ripple effect of the new wave of so-called western sanctions against the people in Russia is already being braced for. As Bitcoin.com news reported just this week, some economists in Venezuela are already predicting trouble for Venezuela’s banking system (and in effect, of course, people), as major Russian banks are now being banned from accessing SWIFT. Venezuelan economist Jose Guerra took to Twitter to explain:Any country with significant financial ties to Russia will likely feel the sting of restrictions on trade.Moving up to Cuba, a country whose residents have had to deal with U.S. trade embargoes for decades, one can also see the impact of restrictions on free trade. And because of this, crypto has historically been a valuable tool here as well.A Reuters report from back in 2019 notes that the “roll-out of mobile internet nearly a year ago has opened the way for cryptocurrency transactions, and enthusiasts have multiplied as the currency helps overcome obstacles created by U.S. sanctions on Cuba.”The report tells of a small business owner who was able to purchase parts for his mobile phone repair shop online with crypto, which were unavailable in the local economy. Computer scientist Adrian C. Leon also emphasized in the same article:For foreigners, cryptocurrencies is just another option, but for Cubans it is a necessity and can be a solution to their exclusion from the global financial community.The nation of Iran has become a hot topic as well, when it comes to the heated debate about sanctions and crypto. A 2021 report by the Iranian think tank Presidential Center for Strategic Studies suggested that newly-minted bitcoins could be leveraged for the purpose of trade beyond geopolitical restrictions. The report detailed:“As the newly-extracted bitcoins are not easily traceable, despite the pressure of sanctions on the country, domestic economic actors can use newly-extracted cryptocurrencies, which are preferable to existing bitcoins, on international exchanges.”Of course, countries typically viewed in western media as terroristic using cryptocurrencies to slip sanctions is seen as a major problem.“You either need to regulate them or ban them. I don’t think there is a middle ground,” Informed Choice chartered financial planner Martin Bamford stated in an Express interview from May 2021, speaking about potential cryptocurrency tax havens. He further noted: “A global crypto currency tax or a global crypto currency regulation ban would be the most effective way of doing it, but only if you can get all the countries on board.”When Bamford was asked which governments might not cooperate, he answered: “Russia, China, or Iran.”Bamford’s prescription seems to be taking shape and gaining currency (no pun). Just last month, global investment bank JPMorgan’s managing director and head of Regulatory Affairs, Debbie Toennies, declared: “I do think we need a globally consistent regulatory framework. It’s important that we get to a solution as quickly as possible.”Other notable forces calling for global regulation are European Central Bank Chief Christine Lagarde and leading centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance. For her part, Lagarde retreated to the tired trope of crypto being the money of criminals, stating:“It’s a highly speculative asset, which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.”Of course, these arguments have been laid to rest by statistics several times over, with fiat’s financing of illicit activity massively dwarfing Satoshi’s supposed contribution to crime. And this crime itself is all too often defined by corrupt lawmakers, and not any logical, ethical compass.When we’re dealing with the caliber of folks who proudly state that literally starving 500,000 children to death is “worth it” for sanctions’ sake, we’d do well to take giant step back and reevaluate.The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously said of governments:A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: ‘I, the state, am the people.’ It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith and a love over them: thus they served life. Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.That sword, those snares — just look at the SEC. Look at the IRS. Look at the central banks of the world and the governments and money they weaponize. These are not the creators Nietzsche is speaking of. These creators are the innovators, the dreamers, and the developers of protocols and code that allow for free worldwide trade regardless of political affiliation or lack thereof.If the goal of regulators is truly “financial inclusion” and the fostering of innovation while protecting investors, why do they seek so desperately to cut the one promising economic lifeline the poor and struggling of the world have right now, and strangle it with red tape? I think we all know the answer.Crypto uses math, not fear-mongering. And thus, it is a threat. It’s a neutral tool like any other. It can be leveraged for both good and ill. There are numerous non-violent ways for communities to choose how they do or do not wish to leverage and/or regulate these technologies, without state laws or other such arbitrary, violence-backed decrees.As Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said last week:Our mission is better served by focusing on individual needs above those of any government or political faction. The People’s Money is an exit strategy for humans, a weapon for peace, not for war.So please, donate to those who need it. In Russia, in Ukraine. Anywhere. Even where someone with political-fueled ignorance tells you not to. Nobody can stop the movement of peer-to-peer electronic cash, short of shutting down the internet or violently wresting your keys from your possession. And at that point, we’ll need to finally address some very fundamental elephants in the room, anyway.What are your thoughts on economic freedom in the context of the current global situation?

51,Billionaire Bill Miller Shares Current Crypto Outlook: 'It's Very Bullish for Bitcoin',"Mar 3, 2022","Veteran investor and fund manager Bill Miller explains why he thinks that it is currently “very bullish for bitcoin.” Miller noted that Russia has almost 50% of its reserves in currencies that are controlled by people who want to do them harm.
Famed value investor Bill Miller talked about the outlook for crypto amid a war between Russia and Ukraine in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. He is the founder of Miller Value Partners and currently serves as its chairman and chief investment officer. He manages the firm’s Opportunity Equity and Income Strategy funds. Prior to Miller Value Partners, he co-founded Legg Mason Capital Management.Following its invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of countries have imposed sanctions on Russia. This has caused the Russian ruble and stocks of Russian companies listed abroad to plummet. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last week: “We will paralyze the assets of Russia’s central bank. This will freeze its transactions. And it will make it impossible for the central bank to liquidate its assets.”Miller explained: “If you look at Russia right now, Russia has 16% of their $640 billion of reserves in dollars. They have 32% in euros. So they have almost 50% of their reserves in currencies that are controlled by people who want to do them harm.” He elaborated:From Russia’s point of view, that’s not a great position to be in. They have 22% in gold and that’s the only part of their reserves which other countries can’t control.The billionaire investor opined: “So I think if you are a country out there that has a non-reserve currency — there’re about a hundred of them — you might think about saying: ‘You know what, maybe we could have something else out there that other countries cannot harm us with, and is impervious to inflation or to being manufactured in greater quantities.” He concluded:So I think it’s very bullish for bitcoin particularly.Miller proceeded to talk about other cryptocurrencies. “The rest of crypto is different,” he added. “I think bitcoin is unique, and the rest of cryptos should be considered as adventure investments because they all try to solve other problems.”The famed value investor has been a bitcoin bull for quite some time. In February, he said he had a “very big” bitcoin position and likened the crypto to digital gold in terms of a hedge against inflation. He also called BTC “insurance against financial catastrophe.”What do you think about Bill Miller’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

52,Mobius Capital Founder Explains Why Bitcoin Is Rallying Amid Russia-Ukraine War,"Mar 2, 2022","Veteran investor Mark Mobius, the founder of Mobius Capital, explains why the price of bitcoin is rallying as the Russia-Ukraine crisis deepens. “Bitcoin is showing strength now because the Russians have a way of getting money out,” he said.
The founder of Mobius Capital Partners, Mark Mobius, explained why the price of bitcoin has been rallying in an interview with CNBC Tuesday as the crisis between Russia and Ukraine escalates.Prior to starting his own company, Mobius was executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group. He joined Templeton in 1987 where he managed more than $50 billion in emerging markets portfolios. He founded Mobius Capital Partners in March 2018.Mobius was asked whether he would buy bitcoin in this environment since the price of BTC is rallying. “I would not be a buyer,” he replied but noted, “If I was a Russian, I would be a buyer.”He proceeded to share that in Dubai where he lives, a lot of foreigners come to buy properties. He detailed: “I was talking to a property agent yesterday. He said they’ll buy anything. They get money out of Switzerland, they have Swiss bank accounts.”Mobius added: “If they can pay with bitcoin. Of course, that’s an avenue to get money out of Russia.” He continued:I would say that’s the reason why bitcoin is showing strength now because the Russians have a way of getting money out, of getting their wealth out.“Otherwise they are really in trouble with all the closures of different avenues for them to transfer money out,” the veteran investor opined.Mobius has long been a bitcoin skeptic. In November last year, he advised people not to look at cryptocurrencies as a means to invest. “It’s a means to speculate and have fun. But then you got to go back to stocks at the end of the day,” he advised.A number of analysts have said they doubt cryptocurrencies can help Russia evade sanctions. Ari Redbord of TRM Labs, for example, explained on CNBC Monday that while Russia will turn to cryptocurrencies, there is not enough liquidity in those markets to allow Moscow to deal with the heavy sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies.What do you think about Mark Mobius’ comments?

Phillips’ Evening Sale of 20th Century & Contemporary Art will auction Basquiat’s “Untitled, 1982” piece worth an estimated $70 million. According to the announcement, Phillips has revealed the auction will accept ethereum or bitcoin for the artwork.The renowned art collector Yusaku Maezawa and the 225-year-old auction house Phillips will be hosting an art auction on May 18, featuring the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat. The American artist is very popular within the neo-expressionism movement and has been compared to the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso who co-founded the Cubist art movement.The art featured at the Evening Sale of 20th Century & Contemporary Art will be Basquiat’s sixteen-foot wide “Untitled, 1982” painting. The “Untitled, 1982” standing at eight feet tall and over 16 feet wide, has an estimated value of around $70 million, according to the auction house Phillips.“This striking horizontal format is likely a nod to Pablo Picasso’s masterwork ‘Guernica,’” the Phillips announcement notes. “I hope that Untitled will continue its great journey in good hands and that it will bring smiles to many people all around the world,” the painting’s consignor Yusaku Maezawa said.The announcement further details that the auction company will allow people to purchase the Basquiat artwork with cryptocurrencies. “Phillips is pleased to announce that the auction house will accept cryptocurrency for the work, in either ethereum or bitcoin,” the firm disclosed.The bitcoin and ethereum payment support for the Basquiat is not the first time Phillips has dabbled in crypto solutions and non-fungible token (NFT) technology. Last year, Phillips revealed it was auctioning a world-famous piece of artwork called the “Laugh Now Panel” created by the anonymous street artist Banksy.The Banksy “Laugh Now Panel” auction was the company’s first time selling artwork for crypto payments in a physical art auction. During the same week as the Phillips Banksy auction announcement, the auction house Sotheby’s detailed it would leverage the exchange Coinbase in order to sell Banksy’s “Love is in the Air” image.Phillips recently hosted a Valentine’s Day 2022 “My Kawaii Valentine Online Auction,” which introduced the first auction data-generative NFT created by a virtual human. “Among the NFTs in the sale is Drowning in Love, the world’s first NFT created by the virtual artist, Monoc, using real-time auction data,” Phillips explained on February 8.In the lead-up to the Basquiat auction, Phillips says the Basquiat art will embark on an international tour to London, Los Angeles, and Taipei. Following the exhibits, the artwork will be auctioned at Phillips’ New York headquarters at 432 Park Avenue.What do you think about Phillips accepting bitcoin and ethereum for the $70 million Basquiat artwork being sold at the auction in May?

This comes as ETH was once again trading below the $3,000 level. As of writing, the crypto market cap is down 1.87%.BTC bulls ran into a stumbling block on Wednesday, as traders appeared to once again short the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Following a high of $44,793.60 yesterday, BTC/USD hit an intraday low of $43,307.96 earlier in today’s session.BTC is down 2.42% on the day, as of writing, and is currently trading at $43,637.72, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 58.7. Looking at the chart, Wednesday’s move occurred after BTC failed to break out of the $44,870 resistance level, which has historically been a point where bears entered. Similar to February 16, these bears halted the bullish onslaught, with many now expecting yet more consolidation from bitcoin.Price strength has also begun to trend in a downward direction, as the RSI ceiling of 62 held firm to start the week. If we are set for further consolidation, the floor of $42,120 could be the next price target for sellers. Following a breakout from its own resistance level on Tuesday, the price of ETH was marginally lower on Wednesday, as it now trades below $3,000. Earlier in today’s session, ETH/USD hit a three-week intraday high of $3,045. However, these gains were short lived.As of writing, ETH has since dropped to a low of $2,907.46, as yesterday’s move has matured into a false breakout. Should this bearish pressure continue to extend throughout the rest of the session, bears will likely be looking at taking ethereum back below $2,880. Relatively speaking, the prospects for bulls targeting $3,200 does remain, however, any further declines could lessen these chances, as prices will likely continue to consolidate. Is today’s drop in ETH only a temporal one? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

55,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Over $3,000, BTC Nears $45,000 as Bulls Return","Mar 1, 2022","Ethereum climbed over the $3,000 level on Tuesday, as crypto bulls returned in full force, following weeks of market tension. Bitcoin also rallied, with prices nearing $45,000 and cryptocurrency markets as a whole trading over 14% higher. The world’s largest cryptocurrency was one of the biggest gainers in the top ten on Tuesday, as bullish sentiment once again returned to markets. Following a low of $39,649.06 yesterday, BTC/USD hit an intraday high of $44,793.60 earlier in today’s session.As of writing, BTC is up 15.20% on the day, with its price trading at the highest level since February 17. Looking at the chart, Tuesday’s move has pushed the price of bitcoin close to a key resistance point of $45,043, a level which hasn’t truly been broken since early January.With prices moving closer to resistance, profit takers have naturally entered, as such today’s candlestick has lost some of its earlier depth. Price strength is also somewhat overbought, and is currently tracking above 60, which is almost a three-week high. Bullish pressure will likely remain, until a marginal break of $45,000 occurs.The price of ETH was also trading at multi-week highs on Tuesday, with some now anticipating even further gains in the near future. ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $3,029.72 during the session, which is almost 14% higher than yesterday’s low of $2,620.38. Today’s move follows a breakout of the $2,882 resistance, which took place for the first time since February 18. A break also occurred with the 14-day RSI, as price strength raced past the 47.9 level, and is currently tracking at 54.81.This new-found momentum will likely have some bulls targeting the $3,200 area, which has acted as resistance in the past. However, there will likely be some turbulence between now and then. Do you expect this gain in prices to extend throughout the week? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

56,Market Strategist Explains 4 Reasons Why BTC Is Rallying — 'Ukraine Crisis Highlights How Bitcoin Can Act as a Support Mechanism',"Feb 28, 2022","On Monday, Sven Henrich, the founder and the lead market strategist for northmantrader.com discussed bitcoin “rallying in the face of this crisis.” The technical analyst and market commentator highlighted four reasons why he believes bitcoin’s value surged — “Fundamental, Sentiment, Technical, [and] Safety trade.”The price of bitcoin (BTC) surged on Monday to a high of $44,256 per unit at 5:35 p.m. (EST). BTC’s price hasn’t been this high in USD value in roughly 39 days, since January 20, 2022. Bitcoin’s price rise sparked a number of conversations on social media and forums during the course of the day. After the price of the leading crypto jumped, gold bug and economist Peter Schiff shared his two cents about the market action on Monday.“Gold and bitcoin are both up today,” Schiff tweeted. “But this move in no way implies a correlation. They’re rising for different reasons. Gold is up as a safe-haven and inflation hedge. Bitcoin is up for the reason ARKK is up. Speculators in risk assets have been conditioned to buy the dips.”Meanwhile, northmantrader.com’s founder and the lead market strategist, Sven Henrich, had an entirely different perspective about bitcoin’s rally on Monday. In a Twitter thread, Henrich described why he thought bitcoin was “rallying in the face of this crisis.” Henrich touched upon four main reasons in the Twitter thread with the first being “Fundamental.”“Fundamental: Adoption [and] acceptance continues to expand, i.e Ebay but also institutional. This path will continue in my view. There is no sign of regression, but continued expansion,” Henrich noted. “Sentiment: The Ukraine crisis highlights how bitcoin can act as a support mechanism to raise funds when traditional avenues are cut off. Blockchain [and] decentralized money to become more relevant.”The market strategist continued:Technical: Bitcoin made a higher low versus equities in February showing a positive divergence [and] defense of a key trend. Start of correlation decoupling process? Safety Trade: Sanctioned money may seek bitcoin as a safe haven (unconfirmed). This also invites risk as it gives excuse to accelerate regulation (long term positive/short term risk).Henrich further added that the bottom line is that bitcoin “is here to stay” and the fiat monetary system further bolsters the fact. “The rationale for [bitcoin’s] existence finding more validation as the existing fiat world requires ever more intervention to stay afloat,” Henrich stressed in his Twitter thread.One person replied to Henrich’s thread and asked: “If people stop putting money into bitcoin does it stay afloat? It’s almost like it requires constant injections of money.” Another individual responded to the question and said:You just described our fiat monetary system.However, some people responding to Henrich’s tweets were inclined to believe that “BTC’s success will be its demise” and the “double-edged sword is starting to bite.” The individual left a link to an article that discussed Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), calling on global lawmakers to approve regulations in order to stop Russia from evading financial sanctions.What do you think about Sven Henrich’s four reasons why bitcoin has rallied in the face of crisis?

57,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH, BTC Rebound After Weekend Selloff","Feb 28, 2022","Bitcoin and ethereum prices rebounded on Monday, after declining throughout the weekend. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine heightened, crypto traders appeared to take a risk-off approach this weekend, however some bulls seemed to return to start the week. Bitcoin ended two consecutive sessions of decline to start the week, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency seemed to have found its price floor.BTC/USD hit an intraday low of $37,268.98 earlier in today’s session, with prices now climbing towards resistance above $40,000.This rebound comes after prices found support at $37,000 on Sunday, which was the lowest level BTC had hit since Friday. Looking at the chart, Monday’s move comes just as the 14-day RSI has marginally broken past its own ceiling at 46, and is currently tracking at 47.84.In addition to this, the momentum of the 10-day moving average (red) is now moving in a sideways path, which could set the floor for a potential upward change in direction. With BTC now hovering on the periphery of $40,000, history does show that price uncertainty heightens here.Bulls will look to evade these bears which typically live in this zone. The price of ETH was also higher to start the week, with a support level also being established within the world’s second largest cryptocurrency. Although higher today, ETH/USD is trading 2.92% lower than at the same point yesterday, when prices fell to an intraday day low of $2,581.62.This low was close to ETH’s long-term floor of $2,550, and as we neared this floor, bulls pushed prices up away from these levels.As such, ETH/USD hit an intraday high of $2,748.15 to start the week, as some hope that we may soon recapture the $2,900 resistance. One of the only hurdles that could prevent this from happening is the fact that the 14-day RSI has now hit its ceiling of 48. Can bulls push price strength beyond this point?

58,"Bitcoin's Hashpower Drops, BTC Mining Difficulty Expected to Jump Higher in 4 Days","Feb 27, 2022","The processing power behind the Bitcoin network has dropped 30% since the hashrate’s all-time high (ATH) on February 15, sliding from 249 exahash per second (EH/s) to 169 EH/s. Furthermore, four days from now, the network’s mining difficulty is expected to increase following the 4.78% epoch change on February 17.From January 13 to February 15, Bitcoin’s hashrate was coasting along at record highs for roughly 33 consecutive days. This weekend, on Sunday, February 27, 2022, the hashrate has dropped 30% from the 249 EH/s ATH captured on February 15. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s (BTC) network hashrate is around 168.14 EH/s or 168,144,793,932,750,200,000 hashes per second (H/s).Meanwhile, bitcoin’s price has been lower than usual but 30-day statistics show the price per BTC is up 4.4%. Although, bitcoin mining monthly revenue and 7DMA revenue mining stats are down according to onchain metrics. The drop in processing power speed may help drop the next difficulty change, as it’s expected to increase by 1.18% in four days to 27.64 trillion. If the difficulty does increase in four days, it will be the seventh consecutive difficulty increase since November 28, 2021.Currently, the top bitcoin mining pool during the last three days is Foundry USA with 20.52% of the global hashrate (38.85 EH/s) and finding 79 block rewards within that time frame. Foundry USA is followed by Antpool’s 30.49 EH/s or 16.10% of the global hashrate. At the time of writing, three-day metrics indicate that there’s 11 known bitcoin mining pools today. Unknown hashrate or stealth miners command 1.3% of the global hashrate or 2.46 EH/s of hashpower capturing five block rewards in three days.Presently, the most-profitable SHA256-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining device is the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro 110 terahash per second (TH/s) machine. Using today’s BTC exchange rate and $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the Antminer S19 Pro makes just over $10 per day. The Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ (112 TH/s) makes $9.82 per day in bitcoin profits.What do you think about the hashrate dropping after it hit an ATH on February 15? What do you think about the next estimated difficulty drop expected in four days? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

59,Crypto Donations Pour in After Ukraine Government Asks for Bitcoin and Ether — $17 Million Raised so Far,"Feb 27, 2022","Ukraine has raised more than $17 million in cryptocurrency donations since Russia began its invasion. Over $10 million were donated directly to the crypto wallets posted by the Ukrainian government about 24 hours after the government solicited donations in bitcoin, ether, and tether.
The Ukrainian government began soliciting cryptocurrency donations Saturday morning. The official Twitter account for Ukraine tweeted: “Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin, ethereum, and USDT.” The tweet also includes a BTC address and an address for ETH and USDT donations. Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine, also tweeted a similar message.Following the Ukrainian government’s solicitation of crypto donations, blockchain data analytics firm Elliptic said Sunday:The Ukrainian government and NGOs providing support to the military have raised $17.2 million through thousands of cryptocurrency donations since the start of the invasion.“Twitter accounts belonging to the Ukrainian government have posted pleas for cryptocurrency donations. The addresses mentioned in the tweets have already received $10.6 million across 13,670 transactions,” Elliptic detailed. “This includes a single donation worth $1.86 million, which appears to have originated from the sale of NFTs [non-fungible tokens] originally intended to raise funds for Julian Assange.”The blockchain analytics firm continued:The majority of donations received to date have been in bitcoin and ether, although US dollar stablecoins contribute a significant proportion.Elliptic further pointed out that crypto supporters are not just donating cryptocurrencies to the Ukrainian government. “People are also sending NFTs to the Ukrainian government’s Ethereum account. One such NFT has a value of approximately $300,” the firm wrote.Olexander Scherba, Ukraine’s ambassador to Austria between 2014 and 2021, commented on the Ukrainian government soliciting crypto donations. He tweeted:To those who want to help in bitcoin.

60,"US Senator Says He's Bullish on Bitcoin Because It's Decentralized, Uncontrollable","Feb 26, 2022","U.S. Senator Ted Cruz says one of the reasons he is so bullish on bitcoin is because it is decentralized and not controllable. He added that “China recently banned bitcoin because they can’t control it, which is the exact same reason Elizabeth Warren hates bitcoin.”
U.S. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas spoke favorably about bitcoin at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Thursday. Launched in 1974, CPAC “is the largest and most influential gathering of conservatives in the world,” its website describes.During his speech at the event, the senator said:One of the reasons why I’m so bullish on crypto, on bitcoin, is because it is decentralized and not controllable.“Let me give a fantastic example,” he continued. “So Justin Trudeau said I don’t like me some truckers, so we are going to freeze your assets. So the court went to try to freeze the crypto that was being given to the truckers.”Senator Cruz proceeded to read aloud a letter from a bitcoin wallet company called Nunchuck to the Ontario Superior Court Justice. The company received an order from the court on Feb. 18 to freeze and disclose information about the assets involved in the Freedom Convoy movement.In the letter to the court, the Nunchuck team explained that it is a “self custodial, collaborative-multisig Bitcoin wallet.” Citing that it is “a software provider, not a custodial financial intermediary,” the company told the court:We cannot ‘freeze’ our users’ assets. We cannot prevent them from being moved. We do not have knowledge of ‘the existence, nature, value and location’ of our users’ assets. This is by design.The letter ends with the company urging the court, “Please look up how self custody and private keys work.”As he put the letter back in his jacket pocket, Senator Cruz exclaimed, “That is spectacular.”Senator Cruz then talked about control, stating:China recently banned bitcoin because they can’t control it, which is the exact same reason Elizabeth Warren hates bitcoin.“The Chinese Communists and Elizabeth Warren, they both want to control you, your assets, your savings, your speech, your life, your children — every decision — they want to control, and so we need to break up the means of controlling the citizenry,” he emphasized.The senator from Texas is a bitcoin holder. In February, he declared that he bought BTC worth between $15,001 and $50,000.Senator Warren has repeatedly bashed bitcoin, citing environmental issues and investor protection. She has urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to use “full authority” to regulate crypto trading.What do you think about Senator Cruz’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

61,"Bitcoin, Tether, Ethereum Trade for Premiums in Ukraine, Hryvnia BTC Price $3K Higher Than Global Average","Feb 26, 2022","After Ukraine’s central bank imposed a limit on cash withdrawals, Kuna, a cryptocurrency exchange that provides trades in ruble and hryvnia saw a notable surge in volume. Moreover, to this day, crypto-assets being swapped on Kuna such as bitcoin, tether, and ethereum are trading for a significant premium.The ongoing conflict continues in Ukraine after Russian troops invaded the territory. The United Nations (UN) estimates that roughly 100,000 Ukrainian citizens have fled the country during the last 24 hours.Following the Russian invasion, two days ago, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) implemented a daily cash withdrawal cap of 100,000 hryvnias ($3,350). The NBU invoked the mandate on February 24, after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky imposed martial law.Immediately following the NBU’s limit mandate on cash withdrawals, the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna saw trade volume surge by $3.5 million on Thursday. Trade volume on Kuna jumped from $1.4 million to a high of $4.8 million with most of the trading pairs in hryvnia (UAH).Volume remains higher on Kuna as volume on the crypto exchange was $780 million six days ago, but today, Kuna’s exchange volume is $1.4 million. Not only does the exchange allow trading in hryvnia (UAH), traders can also swap coins in ruble (RUB).There’s also a premium on bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and tether (USDT) on the Kuna exchange as tether is swapping for $1.08 per token at the time of writing. Outside Ukraine, at the same time, tether (USDT) is exchanging hands for $0.99 per coin.On Kuna, leveraging the hryvnia (UAH) pair, a single ethereum (ETH) is currently swapping for $2,982.83 per unit, while outside Ukraine ETH trades for $2,770 per unit.Bitcoin (BTC) is exchanging hands for $42,106 when swapped with the hryvnia (UAH) pair, as the premium is $3,124 more expensive than the crypto asset outside Kuna’s platform.Localbitcoins.com bitcoin (BTC) prices are also seeing a premium as some sellers are selling for prices as high as 1,296,879.12 UAH/BTC or $43,480 per coin. However, localbitcoins.com metrics for this week show trade volume in Ukraine is currently lower than usual.Similarly, localbitcoins.com has not seen any meaningful upswings in BTC trade volume in Russia. As far as Kuna is concerned, there is a RUB/BTC premium as BTC is swapping for $40,705 or 3,414,848 RUB. ETH/RUB on Kuna has a premium as well but not as high as the premium for hryvnia (UAH) ether swaps.What do you think about the premiums on bitcoin, tether, and ethereum in Ukraine?

62,"China Mining Ban Worsened Bitcoin’s Carbon Footprint, Study Claims","Feb 26, 2022","Contrary to some expectations, Beijing’s crackdown on the crypto mining industry has increased Bitcoin’s carbon emissions, researchers have alleged. Leaving China, miners also left behind its eco-friendly hydropower and are increasingly relying on energy generated by fossil fuels, they claim.Cryptocurrency mining has become a dirtier process after the Chinese government effectively prohibited bitcoin extraction in the People’s Republic, according to research published in the Joule journal. The share of renewable energy used to power mining operations has fallen from almost 42% to around 25% last August, the study insists.It has been estimated that Bitcoin produces more than 65 megatons of carbon dioxide annually. The amount exceeds the total carbon emissions of a country like Greece, for example, which in 2019 registered less than 57 megatons of CO2. One of the authors, Alex de Vries, told the BBC:We see the network becoming less green than ever before.Speaking to Bloomberg, he elaborated that the relocation of mining companies to other countries such as the United States and Kazakhstan has led to a reduction in the use of renewable energy sources. This made bitcoin production less friendly to the environment as it resulted in the increase of its carbon intensity by about 17%.De Vries is the founder of Digiconomist.net, a platform presenting itself as “dedicated to exposing the unintended consequences of digital trends” and publishing the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. He is a researcher at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, and also an employee of the Dutch central bank. His estimates about Bitcoin’s energy usage have been challenged by crypto media and members of the community but quoted by mainstream publications.Migration to the U.S. has expanded the use of fossil fuels, especially natural gas, as a relatively small portion of the nation’s electrical energy is sourced from renewables, the latest report co-authored by De Vries claims. And moving to Kazakhstan often leads to utilizing electricity from power stations burning what’s known as “hard coal,” polluting more than the Chinese plants that miners worked with outside the wet season.China banned crypto-related activities such as trading back in 2017 but the government did not interfere with mining until last spring. In May 2021, the State Council decided to clamp down on the industry following President Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality in the next four decades. The crackdown has since spread to provinces like Sichuan where miners had access to hydropower.Industry groups had been more optimistic about the use of renewables in the minting of digital currencies, BBC noted in its article. It quotes an older estimate made by the Bitcoin Mining Council, according to which the “global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix had grown to approximately 58.5%.”Meanwhile, in Europe, nations such as Sweden and regulators like the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have more recently voiced concerns over the growing use of renewable energy for bitcoin mining. They have issued calls for an EU-wide ban on energy-intensive mining methods.On Friday, news came out that the European Parliament canceled a scheduled vote on the bloc’s new crypto regulations after a proposal to prohibit proof-of-work mining found its way to the draft Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework and sparked negative reactions from the industry.What are your thoughts on the findings of the bitcoin mining study? Let us know in the comments section below.

BTC momentarily passed the $40,000 level, with ETH moving towards $2,800.As of writing, cryptocurrency markets are up by over 3% on Saturday, with bitcoin trading close to 1% higher to start the weekend.This comes following a low of $38,416.53 yesterday, with BTC/USD hitting an intraday high of $40,005.35 earlier in today’s session.Saturday’s move sees BTC break beyond the key $40,000 level, however the move did not last, as profit takers likely closed their positions due to the current market risk.Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI currently hovers above its long-term ceiling of 44, and is approaching the 45 level.BTC now trades below its recent resistance point of $39,500, as the momentum of the 10-day moving average continues to tumble.However, should price strength remain above resistance, bulls may be targeting an exit at $41,500.The price of ETH was also higher to start the weekend, with markets nearing long-term resistance of $2,900.As of writing, ETH/USD is trading 2.16% higher, after rising to a peak of $2,835.66, following Friday’s intraday low of $2,664.45.Similar to BTC, once prices neared resistance, we saw a selloff, which was likely caused by profit takers liquidating their positions.Following the downturn at its ceiling, ethereum is now trading around $2,760, with some targeting the floor of $2,550.The downside momentum of the short-term 10-day moving average (red), will likely be one of the main indicators to keep some traders bearish in ETH.Could we potentially see this level hit by Sunday?

64,Bitcoin Donations Pour in to Help Ukrainian Military Fight Russia — Over $5 Million in BTC Raised,"Feb 25, 2022","Cryptocurrency donations have poured into a nonprofit organization that provides support to Ukrainian soldiers after Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine. More than $5 million in bitcoin has already been raised. Meanwhile, the group’s fundraising page on Patreon has been abruptly removed.One of the largest non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing support to Ukraine’s military, Come Back Alive, has received over $5 million in bitcoin donations after Russia launched a large-scale offensive against Ukraine.Founded in 2014, the Kyiv-based group provides support to Ukrainian soldiers, including a range of military equipment, training services, and medical supplies.Donations to the BTC address listed on the organization’s website soared Thursday after Russia launched a full-scale military attack on Ukraine. At the time of writing, the wallet address has received 131.78144015 BTC.An analysis of all the donations to the address shows that 2,207 donations totaling 126.04304091 BTC were received from Feb. 24 to late Feb. 25. At the current bitcoin price of $39,676.51 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets, the donations received since Feb. 24 are worth more than $5 million.In comparison, the wallet only received 1.60976481 BTC (76 donations) on Feb. 23, and 0.42272864 BTC (25 donations) on Feb. 22.The chief scientist and co-founder of blockchain analytics platform Elliptic, Tom Robinson, tweeted Thursday:Cryptocurrency donations in support of the Ukrainian armed forces are soaring.“Cryptocurrency is increasingly being used to crowdfund war, with the tacit approval of governments,” he was quoted by CNBC as saying.Elliptic also did an analysis on the donations received by Come Back Alive. The firm described that on Feb. 24, the NGO received over $675,000 in bitcoin, and by 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 25, it had already received more than $3.4 million. Noting that over $3 million (80 BTC) was sent by a single donor, the firm wrote: “This pushes the total the group has raised in just 24 hours to over $4 million.”The Come Back Alive organization began accepting bitcoin donations in 2018. BTC donations have been surging recently, with nearly $200K received in the second half of 2021, according to Elliptic. Earlier this month, the platform published a report showing that donations in digital assets to Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups rose 900% last year.Meanwhile, Come Back Alive’s fundraising page on Patreon has been removed by the platform.Come Back Alive Director Taras Chmut told CNBC in an interview that the group was receiving small amounts for several months from its page on Patreon, and then over $300,000 rolled in after Russia started invading Ukraine.However, when he tried to transfer the money out to pay for equipment, he discovered that his organization’s page on Patreon had been removed. He contacted the platform which said it was looking into the case.A Patreon spokesperson told CNBC:Patreon does not allow any campaigns involved in violence or purchasing of military equipment, regardless of their cause.Chmut opined, “We have people dying because they don’t have body armor,” adding that Ukraine is not a rich country, and Come Back Alive has helped soldiers receive the equipment they need.What do you think about bitcoin donations soaring to help the Ukrainian military fight Russia?

Compared to the previous year, the bitcoin revenue increased 119% while gross profit rose 124%.
Block Inc., formerly Square Inc., released its Q4 2021 earnings report Thursday. The report includes the performance of Cash App, the firm’s mobile payment platform that allows users to trade bitcoin.The company stated:Cash App generated $1.96 billion of bitcoin revenue and $46 million of bitcoin gross profit during the fourth quarter of 2021, up 12% and 14% year over year, respectively.“Compared to the third quarter of 2021, bitcoin revenue and gross profit increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven primarily by increased volatility in the price of bitcoin, which affected trading activity compared to the prior quarter,” Block detailed, adding:For the full year of 2021, Cash App generated $10.01 billion of bitcoin revenue and $218 million of bitcoin gross profit, up 119% and 124% year over year, respectively.Block explained: “Bitcoin revenue is the total sale amount of bitcoin to customers. Bitcoin costs are the total amount of bitcoin that we purchase.” This means Block’s version of bitcoin revenue is simply its trading volume.The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has urged Block to clear the confusion. He tweeted Thursday: “Hey guys please stop calling this ‘revenue.’ It’s volume.” He clarified that Block had about $2 billion of trading volume and charged about 2% on it, making around $40 million in profit.The Jack Dorsey-led company is holding some BTC on its balance sheet. “In the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021, we invested $50 million and $170 million, respectively, in bitcoin,” the company noted.What do you think about Cash App’s bitcoin business?

66,"Russian Bitcoin Mining Assessed Amid Conflict With Ukraine, Large ETH Pool Cancels Service to Russia","Feb 25, 2022","With the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, many observers are curious about the large quantity of hashrate located in Russia, as the region reportedly controls the third-largest sum of SHA256 hashpower worldwide. Furthermore, on February 24, the ethereum mining operation Flexpool announced it has halted services to Russia entirely. “We apologize to our Russian miners; many of you do not support the war — However, it is you who are supporting your nation,” Flexpool told its customers.All eyes are focused on the battle between Russia and Ukraine this week and after Vladimir Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine, a large swathe of countries have started to impose and threaten economic sanctions. The Russian ruble has been feeling the wrath of volatile markets, Russia’s stock market shuddered and UBS cut Russia’s bond market down to zero.The European Union handed down economic sanctions against Russia, and U.S. president Joe Biden revealed America would sanction the country as well. Despite the U.K. begging the SWIFT payment network to ban Russia, the country is still allowed to leverage the financial system. Crypto advocate and Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees made fun of the fact that Russia was still allowed to transact with SWIFT.“Apparently Russia’s actions are so egregious that the West has decided to permit Russia to continue using the SWIFT Network,” Voorhees tweeted.Furthermore, cryptocurrency advocates have been discussing Russia’s hashpower as the country reportedly holds the third largest quantity of hashrate worldwide. That statistic stems from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) data that was published in July. A myriad of mining operations mine cryptocurrencies from Russia, as electricity is very cheap. For instance, Bitcluster has operated in Russia since 2017 with over 20,000 mining devices and it offers hosting at $0.062 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).A mining operation called Vekus leverages the Russian oil drilling subsidiary Gazpromneft in order to mine bitcoin. At the end of last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin explained that Russia has “competitive advantages” when it comes to cryptocurrency mining. The mining operation Compass Mining also hosts bitcoin miners in the Siberian region. On Thursday, Whit Gibbs from Compass Mining explained on Twitter that the company’s facilities in Siberia were “well isolated from any geopolitical unrest.” Gibbs added:Compass has confirmed with our partners that all miners are safe and will continue running as normal.The media is already talking about Russia leveraging cryptocurrencies and crypto asset mining to avoid sanctions. According to the blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic, Iran utilized bitcoin mining to avoid economic sanctions. Last week, the Biden administration told semiconductor manufacturers that they should “diversify their supply chain” and at the same time, the California-based technology company Intel announced the launch of bitcoin mining chips.Amid the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Bitcoin’s hashrate has dropped a hair since reaching an all-time high on February 15, 2022. On that day, six-month charts show the hashrate tapped 249.75 exahash per second (EH/s) and today it is down 26% since that high, at 182 EH/s. While bitcoin miners seem to be unaffected by the situation in Ukraine, on Thursday the ethereum mining operation Flexpool announced it will be cutting off Russian ethereum miners. Flexpool is currently the fifth-largest ethereum miner in terms of ETH hashrate.“While there is little we can do, it would be wrong to profit off of it or fund it indirectly. We are canceling service to all Russian IPs and paying out outstanding balances,” Flexpool’s announcement notes. “We apologize to our Russian miners; many of you do not support the war. However, it is you who are supporting your nation. Without the people, Russia cannot operate. It is only through reducing the economic power of its people that we have a chance of affecting this war. We thank you for your loyalty, and I hope you understand that we do not make this decision lightly.”What do you think about the conflict in Ukraine and the possibility of Russia avoiding sanctions with cryptocurrencies?

The same company had already registered a sale of this kind in Mexico, where a buyer located in Peru made a remote purchase.Analysts state that sales of this kind are likely to become more common in time. Guillermo Torrealba, General Manager of Buda, a regional exchange, stated:It is normal that we are seeing the beginning of this business of cryptocurrencies with properties, because Bitcoin can be seen as an investment.Nicolas Herrera, studies submanager at Toctoc, another proptech firm, also states that with their new restrictions, banks are making the task of acquiring a house difficult for most people.What do you think about the reported first real estate purchase made with bitcoin in Chile?

68,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Momentarily Rebounds, Following Russian Invasion of Ukraine","Feb 25, 2022","Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, volatility in bitcoin and ethereum prices intensified, with both falling to one-month lows on Thursday. Both have since moved away from these lows so far today, in what looks like temporal consolidation.As of writing, cryptocurrency markets are up by over 7% on Friday, with bitcoin trading 8% higher heading into the weekend.This comes following a low of $34,997.01 yesterday, with BTC/USD hitting an intraday high of $38,968.84 earlier in today’s session.Friday’s move sees BTC momentarily rebound, and edge closer to the key $40,000 level, which it hasn’t hit since the beginning of the week. Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI has also tailed off slightly, and now looks to be consolidating below the 43.8 resistance.As long as prices remain between the floor of $37,240 and ceiling of $39,640, market uncertainty will likely extend.However, current sentiment seems to be more bearish, as the 10-day moving average continues to trend downwards.The price of ETH was also marginally higher, as bulls seem reluctant to let the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fall below its long-term support.As of writing, ETH/USD is trading 9.20% higher, after rising to a peak of $2,689.05, following Thursday’s intraday low of $2,341.72.Price strength also climbed, with the 14-day RSI breaking beyond its recent resistance point at 39.60, and currently is tracking at 40.80.Following the move, ETH now sits slightly above a higher support of $2,550, a level which has birthed several bull runs in the past.Despite this, traders are likely to remain cautious, as many fear that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will only worsen, leading to investors taking a risk-off approach. Do you expect ETH to decline further heading into the weekend? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

69,"Crypto Community Discusses Warfare in Ukraine, Importance of Crypto, and the Future of Bitcoin","Feb 24, 2022","During the course of the early morning trading sessions on Thursday (EST), 24-hour statistics show the crypto economy dropped more than 11% in value against the U.S. dollar. While the leading crypto asset bitcoin shed close to 10%, a myriad of alternative digital assets lost close to 20% in value. The crypto market downturn is being blamed on Russia invading Ukraine’s borders as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s troops entered the country before dawn on February 24. The digital currency community has been discussing the situation and many crypto advocates have different opinions about the current geopolitical risk and its future effects on the crypto economy.Following the report Bitcoin.com News published on Wednesday evening (EST), media reports disclosed that Russian troops have invaded Ukraine and acts of war have been committed. While the scope of the attack is uncertain, reports indicate that cruise missiles have been fired and there have been a few explosions adjacent to Kyiv’s international airport.As our newsdesk’s report noted yesterday, the geopolitical tension has caused stock markets and cryptocurrencies to fall significantly in value. At the time of writing, the entire crypto-economy has lost 11.1%, and just before Thursday’s opening bell, futures indicate that Wall Street stocks are in for a volatile day of trading.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency advocates are talking about the Russia and Ukraine situation in great detail and discussing theories about the future of crypto markets amid the escalated conflict.For instance, the “reformed hedge-fund manager” and bitcoin proponent James Lavish told his 18,000 Twitter followers: “If you’re selling bitcoin here because of fears of war and civil unrest, you have absolutely no idea what you own and why it is so vitally important for the world at this very moment.”FTX CEO Samuel Bankman-Fried also discussed the situation in Ukraine and he stressed that war is “really bad for the world.” Bankman-Fried further noted that Eastern European financial systems and currencies were feeling the wrath of the storm.“It makes sense that stocks are down,” the FTX CEO said. “War is, generally, bad. What should BTC be doing here? — If the world gets sh***ier, people have less free cash. Basically, selling BTC — along with stocks, etc. — to pay for war.”The FTX executive added:On the other hand, this is likely destabilizing for Eastern European currencies. And, more generally, for Eastern European financial systems. Which means they might be looking to alternatives. If you were in Ukraine right now, where would you trust your money?Many crypto supporters continued to highlight that despite the market carnage, censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies are very important during times like these.“There’s a war going on outside,” an individual wrote on Twitter. “Tempted to say ‘crypto doesn’t matter today.’ But that’s BS. As long as the world is fueled by the traditional money printing machine the forever wars continue. Bitcoin adoption [and] blockchain tech will separate the nation-states from banks.”“It’s not World War III, it’s the best time to jump into bitcoin,” another individual tweeted. Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor replaced the old “give peace a chance” adage with the word bitcoin and said: “Give bitcoin a chance.”Of course, the gold bug and economist Peter Schiff threw in his two cents about the Russian invasion, the Fed, gold, and bitcoin.“Perhaps, the Fed is relieved that Russia invaded Ukraine as now it has an excuse not to raise interest rates in March,” Schiff tweeted. “If it wasn’t this it would’ve been something else, but as far as excuses go this one’s hard to top. Gold spiked 1.5% and bitcoin dumped 5.5% on the news.” Schiff wholeheartedly believes that sanctions on Russia could end up making inflation jump even higher for Americans. Other observers agree with Schiff and think that the Fed will not accept fiscal responsibility after the Russian invasion.One crypto advocate on social media insisted:Inflation gets worse during war, not better. My prediction is that any attempts at fiscal responsibility by the Fed will go out the window. #Bitcoin.The conversation concerning the Federal Reserve is tied to the predicted rate hike slated for March. While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) told the press it would raise the benchmark interest rate “soon,” Fed chair Jerome Powell remarked to the press that it would likely happen during the March FOMC meeting.If the U.S. central bank does increase the bank rate, equity and cryptocurrency markets could see more sell-offs. Although, as mentioned by Schiff and many others, the crisis in Ukraine may stop the Fed from raising the bank rate and pause the tapering of large-scale monetary purchases as well.What do you think about the geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine and the adverse effects on global markets?

70,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC, ETH Climb for Second Consecutive Session","Feb 23, 2022","Bitcoin was higher for a second consecutive session, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency was pushing towards the $40,000 level. Ethereum also rallied, as it moved away from its three-week low.Bearish pressure seems to have eased in BTC, as bulls were firmly present to start Wednesday’s trading session.Following a low below $36,400 yesterday, BTC/USD hit an intraday high of $38,917.27 earlier in today’s session.The move sees bitcoin edge closer to the key $40,000 level, which it broke below on Monday, following rising tensions with Ukraine and Russia. Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI has also gained, and now sits at 43.73, which is marginally below resistance of 44.74.Bulls hoping that BTC enters the $40,000 level will likely wait to see if the momentum of the last two days extends. If so, they could look to boost price strength even further. We may now see some tentative action around the current level, until a clear break of this ceiling takes place. ETH also moved higher, as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency rallied away from recent lows.As of writing, ETH/USD is up close to 3%, after rising to an intraday high of $2,741.30, which is its highest level since Monday.Price strength also climbed, with the 14-day RSI breaking beyond its own resistance point at 40, currently tracking at 43.35.Despite the climb, there is another ceiling close by, with the 44.42 level seen as a major hurdle, due to the level of bears which have lived there in the past.Markets now wait to see if history will repeat itself, or if we will have a breakout, and potentially head towards $3,000.Could these gains extend heading into the latter part of the week?

71,El Salvador's Tourism Rises 30% After Bitcoin Became Legal Tender,"Feb 22, 2022","El Salvador’s tourism has grown more than 30% after adopting bitcoin as legal tender, according to the country’s ministry of tourism. “Cryptocurrency multiplies the opportunities to do business with more partners anywhere in the world,” the Salvadoran government explained.
The Salvadoran government has outlined some economic benefits resulting from adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The country’s bitcoin law went into effect in September last year, making BTC a national currency alongside the U.S. dollar.A notice posted on the government website Monday explains that during the first months of bitcoin being legal tender in El Salvador, “it was possible to identify the advantages of having added innovation and financial freedom.” The notice adds that tourism was one of the first sectors where it was possible to verify how bitcoin has helped the country’s economy.The head of the Ministry of Tourism (MITUR), Morena Valdez, commented: “The implementation of bitcoin benefited the sector. More tourists and investors have come to see how cryptocurrency works.” She elaborated:We did a poll to check the activity before and after bitcoin. The tourism sector increased, in November and December, more than 30%.The tourism minister continued: “Expectations of recovery in this sector have been exceeded since 1.1 million visitors had been projected and 1.4 million have been received.” Minister Valdez noted that 60% of the visitors to El Salvador came from the U.S.The notice on the government website adds that together with other initiatives undertaken by the Salvadoran government, “cryptocurrency multiplies the opportunities to do business with more partners anywhere in the world.”Adopting bitcoin as legal tender has also boosted the country’s GDP growth, according to El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele. He explained that El Salvador achieved a double-digit GDP growth for the first time in history after it adopted the bitcoin law. Bukele tweeted Saturday:El Salvador’s GDP grew 10.3% in 2021 … El Salvador never had a double digit GDP growth before 2021.Furthermore, the Salvadoran president noted that El Salvador’s “exports (a main driver of economic growth) grew 13% this January, compared to January 2021.”What do you think about El Salvador’s economy after making bitcoin legal tender?

72,Ruby on Rails Creator Capitulates on Bitcoin After Seeing Canadian Government's Response to Freedom Convoy,"Feb 22, 2022","The creator of Ruby on Rails says the situation in Canada is “terrifying” and “a real wakeup call.” He admits that he was wrong about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. “A few months ago, I would not have found it credible if you said a three-week peaceful protest in Canada could have led to martial law, frozen bank accounts, and terrorist-financing laws being used to hunt protest donors,” he stressed.
The creator of Ruby on Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), has admitted that he was wrong about bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Hansson, a Danish programmer, is also a partner at the web-based software development firm Basecamp. He is also a New York Times best-selling author.Hansson outlined why he changed his mind about bitcoin and crypto in an opinion piece titled “I was wrong, we need crypto,” published Monday.“To say I’ve been skeptical about Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto universe would be an understatement of epic proportions,” Hansson began, noting that he has been condemning bitcoin since the early 2010s. He cited many reasons for his opposition, including “Bitcoin’s grotesque energy consumption, the ridiculous transaction fees and low throughput, the incessant pump ‘n’ dump schemes in shitcoins,” and the Tether “fraud.”However, he now admitted:My bigger beef was actually fueled by a lack of imagination.The programmer explained that while he could see the benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in countries like Venezuela, China, or Iran, the vast number of bitcoin boosters are “living in stable Western democracies governed by the rule of law.”However, recent events in Canada have changed his mind, led by the Trudeau government invoking the Emergencies Act in order to end the Freedom Convoy trucker protest. One of the provisions afforded by the Act is allowing financial institutions and crypto exchanges to freeze bank accounts and crypto wallets tied to the protest with no consequences.Hansson stated:A few months ago, I would not have found it credible if you said a three-week peaceful protest in Canada could have led to martial law, frozen bank accounts, and terrorist-financing laws being used to hunt protest donors. Unbelievable then, undeniable now.“This is crazy. Absolutely bonkers. Terrifying,” he described the situation.“Is France really that different from Canada? Is Austria? Is Denmark? This is a real wake-up call,” he exclaimed.“I still can’t believe that this is the protest that would prove every Bitcoin crank a prophet. And for me to have to slice a piece of humble pie, and admit that I was wrong on crypto’s fundamental necessity in Western democracies,” Hansson conceded, concluding:It’s clear to me now that I was too hasty to completely dismiss crypto on the basis of all the things wrong with it at the moment. Instead of appreciating the fundamental freedom to transact that it’s currently our best shot at protecting.Does the situation in Canada change your mind about bitcoin and cryptocurrency?

73,Grayscale Investments Asks Investors to Help Convince SEC to Approve Bitcoin Spot ETF,"Feb 22, 2022","Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, has launched a campaign aimed at convincing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve its bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application. Grayscale seeks to convert its $25.7 billion bitcoin trust (GBTC) to a bitcoin spot ETF.
Grayscale Investments announced Tuesday the launch of a campaign “to educate and encourage American investors to submit comments” on its application with the SEC to convert Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC) to a spot bitcoin ETF. GBTC is the company’s largest investment product with $25.7 billion in assets under management.The application was filed on Oct. 19 by NYSE Arca, the exchange that will list and trade shares of the new bitcoin ETF, if approved. On Dec. 15, the SEC designated a longer period to consider Grayscale’s application. On Feb. 4, the Commission asked the public for comments on the application.The SEC has only approved bitcoin futures ETFs so far. The securities watchdog continues to reject bitcoin spot ETF applications.Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein commented, “American investors should have a choice in how to obtain bitcoin exposure,” emphasizing:It is clear we have reached a tipping point in the adoption of digital assets.“Maintaining the regulatory status quo may feel like the safe option, but the reality is that failing to keep pace with change is the far riskier path for main street investors and our country,” he continued.Grayscale has set up a dedicated campaign page to educate and inspire American investors to take action and convince the SEC to approve its application to convert GBTC to a spot bitcoin ETF.The CEO added:The hundreds of comments already submitted on behalf of GBTC’s conversion to an ETF further demonstrates that this issue is of the utmost importance to investors.Do you think the SEC will soon approve a bitcoin spot ETF? Let us know in the comments section below.

74,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Finds Temporary Support, After Hitting 3-Week Low","Feb 22, 2022","Ethereum found support on Tuesday, following a drop to a three-week low earlier in today’s session. This comes as the price of bitcoin also consolidated, following recent bearish pressure. The selloff in BTC momentarily eased on Tuesday, as global markets continued to closely monitor the Russia/Ukraine situation.BTC/USD dropped to a low of $36,488.93 earlier in today’s session, which is over $3,000 lower than its high to start the week.The move saw BTC briefly break out of its long-term floor of $37,315, in what looks like a false drop, before once again re-entering this support point. As this move in price took place, price strength in bitcoin moved deeper into oversold territory, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 33, which is its lowest point in 20 days.As anticipated yesterday, price momentum has also firmly shifted, with the 10-day (red) moving average and 25-day (blue) MA meeting for what appears to be a downside cross.For now bitcoin is holding steady at support, as bulls look to fend off the bearish pressure, however this could shift, if the recent trend extends. ETH also fell to a three-week low during today’s session, however the bullish resistance to the recent declines has helped prices find a floor. Today saw ETH/USD fall to an intraday low of $2,510.68, which is its weakest level since January 31.Despite this, prices rebounded from those earlier lows, climbing above support of $2,550 in the process. Similar to BTC/USD, a downward cross of the moving averages has also firmly occurred, however today’s bounce has pushed the 14-day RSI slightly higher. Price strength now stands at 39, and is approaching the 40 point, which looks to be a ceiling, however if this could be breached, then more bulls could return.Is $2,550 the true floor for ethereum, or could prices move lower?

75,"Huobi Co-Founder: We're at Early Stage of Bitcoin Bear Market, Next Bull Run Expected in 2024","Feb 21, 2022","The co-founder of crypto exchange Huobi has shared his view about the current state of the bitcoin market and when the next bull run will be. “We are now at the early stage of a bear market,” he said, expecting the next bitcoin bull market to be around the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.
Du Jun, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, discussed when the next bitcoin bull market might be in an interview with CNBC, published Sunday.The exchange executive explained that bitcoin bull markets are closely tied to the halving, which occurs every 210,000 blocks or approximately every 4 years. The next one will take place in 2024.He detailed that the last halving took place in May 2020, and bitcoin topped an all-time high above $68,000 in 2021. Similarly, the halving that took place in 2016 saw BTC hitting a record high the following year. The price of bitcoin then tumbled after hitting record highs.Noting that bitcoin has fallen about 40% since its all-time high in November last year, Du was quoted by the news outlet as saying if the pattern continues:We are now at the early stage of a bear market … Following this cycle, it won’t be until end of 2024 to beginning of 2025 that we can welcome next bull market on bitcoin.Nonetheless, he admitted: “It is really hard to predict exactly because there are so many other factors which can affect the market as well — such as geopolitical issues including war, or recent Covid, also affect the market.”A number of people believe that we are in a crypto winter, including the analysts at Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, who recently warned of a crypto winter amid expectations of Fed rate hikes and regulation. Last week, veteran trader Peter Brandt also pointed out that bitcoin’s price corrections “can be lengthy.”What do you think about the Huobi co-founder’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

76,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC, ETH Prices Lower for a Sixth Straight Day","Feb 21, 2022","Bitcoin was trading lower to start the week, as markets were anticipating the release of U.S. president Biden’s executive order on cryptocurrencies. Ethereum also remained in the red, and continues to track at multi-week lows. Bitcoin prices were almost 12% lower from the same point last week, as prices fell for a sixth straight day on Monday.Following a high of $39,394.44 on Sunday, BTC/USD dropped to a low of $37,358.00 to start the trading week. The move saw BTC near its long-term support against the dollar of $37,200, hitting its lowest level since February 4 in the process.Price strength in bitcoin is now firmly oversold, with the 14-day RSI tracking at 39, which is its lowest point in over three weeks.This recent downward trend has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average on the cusp of crossing over the 25-day (blue) MA.Should this happen, we may see yet even more declines in the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.Like bitcoin, prices of ethereum were also down to start the week, with the world’s second largest cryptocurrency trading almost 9% lower from its position last Monday. Monday saw ETH/USD fall to an intraday low of $2,585.95, which is its weakest level since February 3. This three-week low came as ETH headed to what seems to be a new floor of $2,560, as can be seen from the chart below. However, shortly after hitting this point, the price of ETH rallied, as historical bulls who bought at this point once again re-entered. This slight rebound has somewhat prolonged the inevitable downside cross of the 10-day and 25-day moving averages, which only recently showed markets signs of further upwards momentum. What are the main factors behind this selloff? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

According to Forbes’ list of billionaires, his net worth is currently more than $13 billion.The billionaire tweeted Saturday urging his Twitter followers to buy bitcoin and keep buying while the price of BTC is still low.

A number of people and corporations have bought the dip, including the Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, and the government of El Salvador.This is not the first time Salinas has strongly recommended buying bitcoin. He explained in June last year: “Bitcoin is an asset that has extraordinary properties … All the advantages that bitcoin has, for me, make it gold for the modern world.”In comparison, Salinas often attacked fiat currency, calling it a fraud. “Governments don’t like bitcoin … it burns them that people can get out of their fiat trap because that is what fiat money is, a fraud,” he opined.In November, he referenced “the scale of fake money creation” in the U.S., stating: “Good old USA is looking more and more like any other irresponsible third world country.” He then advised, “Buy bitcoin right now.”He reiterated in December last year: “Stay away from fiat money. The dollar, the euro, the yen, or the peso — they are all the same story. It’s fake money made of paper and lies. The central banks are printing more money than ever before. Invest in bitcoin.”What do you think about the Mexican billionaire’s bitcoin advice? Let us know in the comments section below.

As of today just under ten million Bitcoin.com wallet users will now be able to send any type of cryptocurrency to simple easy-to-read crypto handles in a more secure and user-friendly transaction experience.FIO Protocol provides users with a new way to transfer cryptocurrencies. Instead of having to use complex wallet addresses, users can simply register a FIO Crypto Handle and use readable wallet names, similar to email addresses, to send, receive, or request any type of cryptocurrency. In some ways, the simplified domain concept is similar to the .eth names offered by Ethereum Name Service, or Unstoppable Domains’ .crypto, .wallet, or .blockchain addresses. However, there is a core difference with FIO Protocol in that its network focuses on user privacy and interoperability between different blockchains.Bitcoin.com integrates the FIO Protocol as it aims to support cryptocurrency usability and mass adoption. Bitcoin.com users will now be able to send any type of cryptocurrency to a FIO Crypto Handle via the Bitcoin.com wallet.Luke Stokes, Managing Director, Foundation for Interwallet Operability: “In just over a decade Bitcoin has emerged as one of the most exciting asset classes for retail and institutional investors, and is viewed by many including myself as the best form of money ever created. For people to properly trust this network they will need to have confidence in the infrastructure and feel sure that who they are sending assets to is in fact the person they think it is, the FIO Protocol enables this to happen.”Dennis Jarvis, CEO, Bitcoin.com: “Bitcoin.com is committed to providing secure and easy-to-use tools for this economic-freedom creating asset class. Unfortunately, cryptocurrency addresses have long been a roadblock to widespread adoption. We wholeheartedly welcome FIO’s efforts to establish an open-source protocol for registering human-readable addresses, and we’re proud to integrate the FIO Protocol in our products.”Bitcoin.com Wallet joins over thirty five major wallets, exchanges and crypto payment processors that have integrated the FIO Protocol into their products. FIO Protocol’s delegated Proof-of-Stake blockchain is governed by FIO token holders, with blockchain fees divided between block producers and the companies that enable the FIO Protocol in their applications.For those interested in using FIO Protocol in the Bitcoin.com wallet, please visit https://bitcoin.com or check out a demo video here.

79,Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Warns Bitcoin's Price Corrections Can Be Lengthy,"Feb 19, 2022","Veteran trader Peter Brandt has warned that bitcoin’s price corrections have taken many months in the past and it may take some time for the price of the cryptocurrency to hit another all-time high. He criticized bitcoin’s proponents for constantly hyping the crypto regardless of the price.
Veteran trader Peter Brandt cautioned investors Thursday that it could take some time for the price of bitcoin to reach another all-time high.Brandt has been a futures and FX career trader since 1975. He is a chartist and the author of the Factor Report. He trades a variety of markets, including Dow futures, bonds, corn, crude oil, European wheat, Osaka Dow, U.S. dollar, and sugar.He criticized bitcoin’s proponents for constantly hyping the cryptocurrency regardless of what the price is doing. “Cheerleaders who constantly beat the drums of ‘to the moon’ are doing a huge disservice to BTC investors,” the trader tweeted, elaborating:Corrections can be lengthy. Long endurance, not constant hype, should be the message.Brandt also included a chart with his tweet showing major bitcoin price highs and the number of months to exceed them. Specifically, he pointed out that it took 21 months for BTC to reach the next new high in 2013, 40 months in 2017, and 36 months in 2020.The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,892 on Nov. 9 last year based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. Since then, it has fallen more than 42%. At the time of writing, the price of BTC is $39,933.Brandt did not offer an estimate of how long it will take for BTC to hit the next new high. However, the veteran trader recently shared his “scared trading rule,” which is to “Never add to a losing trade.”According to a panel of fintech specialists at Finder.com, bitcoin will peak at $94K this year. By the end of 2025, the panel believes BTC’s price will reach $192,800 and $406,400 in 2030.Meanwhile, global investment bank Goldman Sachs has warned that the price of bitcoin is vulnerable to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates. In January, Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, warned of crypto winter. Nonetheless, global investment bank JPMorgan has a long-term price prediction of $150K for BTC but estimated its fair value to be $38K.What do you think about Peter Brandt’s warning?

80,Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary Expects Bitcoin to 'Appreciate Dramatically' in 2-3 Years,"Feb 19, 2022","Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, has shared what he thinks the price of bitcoin will be in the coming years. He said when institutions get the go-ahead from their compliance departments to invest in bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency “is going to appreciate dramatically.”Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary shared his prediction of the price of bitcoin in an interview with Stansberry Research last week.He explained that many institutions are not allowed to invest in bitcoin, stating: “That’s well-known because it just hasn’t been ruled by the regulator yet. So, as a proxy to getting exposure to bitcoin, they buy the equities of public bitcoin mining companies, Marathon, Riot, etc.”O’Leary detailed:You want to talk about bitcoin going to $100K, $200K, $300K, it’s going to happen when institutions can finally buy it.“I can tell you with certainty right now because I service sovereign wealth funds and pension plans,” Mr. Wonderful continued. “In the indexing business, for all the hype around bitcoin, none of those institutions own a single coin. And they are not going to until their compliance departments allow for the ESG mandates.” In addition, he noted that the crypto asset class itself has to be compliant.The Shark Tank star opined:When they do get that go-ahead, the price of the coin is going to appreciate dramatically.O’Leary further explained that the way to think about bitcoin is not to think about it as a coin but as software.“These institutions own Microsoft. They own Google. That’s software too, so it is very easy for them to get their heads around it. As soon as it’s compliant, they will buy 1% to 3%, and that’s when the price is going to appreciate,” he emphasized, elaborating:I think that’s going to happen in the next two to three years.In October last year, O’Leary said that if the U.S. regulator finally allowed financial services companies to call bitcoin an asset and put it into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like they have in Canada, “there’d be another trillion dollars worth of buying into bitcoin.”What do you think about Kevin O’Leary’s bitcoin prediction?

Bitcoin was also under $40,000, as the global cryptocurrency market cap dropped by nearly 3% as of writing. For a fourth consecutive session, prices of the world’s largest cryptocurrency traded lower, as market pressure continued to keep bulls away.Following a high of $40,827.13 on Friday, BTC/USD is down 1.3% as of writing, and is trading close to its lowest level since February 4. .The move saw BTC hit an intraday low of $39,637.62, which has acted as an area of support in the past.This drop in price comes as price strength has also firmly entered oversold territory, after breaking below the 44.20 floor of the 14-day RSI.We are now tracking at 43.55 on this indicator, which is its lowest reading since February 3, where bitcoin was traded at a low of $36,200. Despite the recent fall, there still seems to be the possibility of further declines, should downside momentum continue to persist.ETH was on the verge of falling below $2,700 as of writing, as the #2 cryptocurrency continued to extend this week’s losing streak.Saturday saw ETH/USD fall to an intraday low of $2,712.96 during today’s session, as such maintaining a two-week low in the process. Looking at the chart, the Relative Strength Index on 14-days has also slipped to multi-week lows, and currently tracks at 41.28, its lowest point since February 2.This drop in price has seen ETH/USD find a floor at $2,685, with the RSI maintaining a support point of 40.However, if these levels cannot be held up due to incoming pressure, we may inevitably see ETH fall towards $2,400.What are the main factors behind this selloff?

Speaking on the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation’s crypto webinar panel, Lummis said that once a regulatory policy is in place it “will make a lot of sense.”This week the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation published a webinar video featuring Bitstamp CEO Bobby Zagotta, former Federal Reserve vice chairman Randal Quarles, and the Republican senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis. The host of the webinar Matt Sandgren mentioned to Quarles that in the early days, bitcoin was met with skepticism from Washington and Wall Street. Sandgren continued by adding that now things seem to be changing and he asked the former Federal Reserve vice chairman if he agreed perspectives have changed.“I think in the early years it wasn’t really clear what the widespread use case would be for bitcoin or similar crypto assets,” Quarles replied. “They solved some technical issues in the payment system but the price volatility made them ill-suited to be an actual payments mechanism. So the principal attractions seem to be independence from the regulated monetary system and anonymity. Neither of those are going to be terribly attractive to Washington.” Quarles continued:For Wall Street, if you are an investor considering a novel technology with an unclear use case that’s likely to attract unwelcome attention from regulators and law enforcement you’re going to move slowly.Quarles then said that things are changing now for a few reasons and one of them includes stablecoins. He thinks because stablecoins “tame the volatility” they are more useful.Following Quarles’ statements and a description of what cryptocurrency is from Bitstamp’s Zagotta, Lummis told Sandgren that she thought it was a “great idea” for the Federal Reserve to purchase bitcoin and hold it on its balance sheet. “Once there is a statutory and regulatory framework, that will make a lot of sense — The fact that bitcoin is completely decentralized, it’s going to make it over time more ubiquitous,” Lummis remarked. The senator from Wyoming added:I think [bitcoin] is going to be something that the Fed should hold on its balance sheet.Senator Cynthia Lummis has been a fan of bitcoin and digital currencies for quite some time and she recently thanked God for bitcoin when the U.S. Congress discussed raising the debt ceiling. During the first week of October, Lummis disclosed that she purchased more bitcoin and said she sees BTC as an “excellent store of value.”However, panel speaker Quarles did not agree with Lummis’ opinion, and he stressed it is unlikely that the U.S. central bank will add BTC to its balance sheet. “For a lot of political, economic reasons,” Quarles said. “I think that it’s best to keep the Fed’s balance sheet.”During her panel statements, Lummis reiterated that she believes bitcoin is a store of value, scarce, and predictable. “Bitcoin is digital gold — it’s hard money — There will only be 21 million ever produced,” Lummis insisted during the panel webinar.What do you think about U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis saying the Fed should hold bitcoin on its balance sheet?

84,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Drops to 2-Week Low Below $40,000","Feb 18, 2022","Losses in cryptocurrency markets extended on Friday, with bitcoin falling to multi-week lows in the process. Ethereum was also lower during the session, whilst the global crypto market cap was down 3.70% as of writing. Bitcoin was down for a third consecutive session, as recent bearish pressure continued to intensify on the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Following a high of $43,327.99 on Thursday, BTC/USD fell below $40,000 during today’s session, and is down nearly 7% as of writing.The move saw BTC hit an intraday low of $39,633 (as of writing), sending prices below its recent support of $41,765.This drop in price comes as market uncertainty continues to heighten, with the situation between Russia and Ukraine likely one of the main culprits. Traders, which typically see BTC as a high-risk asset, have moved to gold instead, leading to prices of the “safe haven” currency climbing to multi-month highs.BTC/USD however seems to have found an interim floor after today’s selloff, with the 14-day RSI also consolidating, after earlier weakness. After barely remaining above the $3,000 level yesterday, the rug was truly pulled from the feet of ETH traders on Friday.ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $2,824.08 during today’s session, which is its lowest level since February 4. The move came as prices of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency fell below support at $2,840. The asset, however, has since regained some of its footing. In addition to this, the 14-day RSI has moved further into oversold territory after this week’s declines, which has seen ETH lose 8% of its value.As of writing, should the current support be broken, bears will likely look to push this toward the $2,500 point. Will this bearish pressure extend into the weekend? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

85,US Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Mitigate Risks From El Salvador Adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender,"Feb 17, 2022","Several U.S. lawmakers have introduced a bill to mitigate the risks from El Salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender. “El Salvador recognizing bitcoin as official currency opens the door for money laundering cartels and undermines U.S. interests,” said a U.S. senator.
The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations announced Wednesday that Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) have introduced a bill titled the ‘‘Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act’’ or ‘‘ACES Act.’’The proposed legislation requires a report from the State Department on El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender and “a plan to mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system,” the announcement details. The State Department report would include an analysis of El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption as legal tender and the risks for cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador.Senator Risch commented:El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises significant concerns about the economic stability and financial integrity of a vulnerable U.S. trading partner in Central America.He added: “This new policy has the potential to weaken U.S. sanctions policy, empowering malign actors like China and organized criminal organizations. Our bipartisan legislation seeks greater clarity on El Salvador’s policy and requires the administration to mitigate potential risk to the U.S. financial system.”Senator Cassidy opined:El Salvador recognizing bitcoin as official currency opens the door for money laundering cartels and undermines U.S. interests.Responding to the bill’s introduction, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted:OK boomers… You have 0 jurisdiction on a sovereign and independent nation. We are not your colony, your back yard or your front yard. Stay out of our internal affairs. Don’t try to control something you can’t control.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year. Since then, the country has purchased 1,801 BTC altogether.The U.S. is not the only country concerned about El Salvador’s Bitcoin law. In November last year, Bank of England (BOE) Governor Andrew Bailey raised concerns about bitcoin being used as legal tender in El Salvador.Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly urged the country to abandon bitcoin as legal tender. According to the IMF, the costs of making BTC legal tender exceed the potential benefits.El Salvador, however, does not see a reason to scale back its Bitcoin law. In fact, President Bukele has predicted that two more countries will adopt BTC as legal tender this year.What do you think about the U.S. introducing a bill to mitigate the risks from El Salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender?

86,Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger Says Government Should Ban Bitcoin — Calls Crypto 'Venereal Disease',"Feb 17, 2022","Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s right-hand man, wishes crypto would be banned immediately. He says the government made “a huge mistake” to allow cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin. “It’s like a venereal disease,” he opined.
Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s right-hand man and longtime business partner, talked about bitcoin and cryptocurrency Wednesday in an interview with Yahoo Finance ahead of the annual shareholders meeting at the Daily Journal, where he serves as chairman.Munger previously called bitcoin “rat poison” and said last year that he hated the success of the cryptocurrency. He was asked if he is surprised that bitcoin has gotten even more mainstream since then.The Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman replied: “If you stop to think about it, it’s an ideal currency if you want to commit extortion, or kidnapping, or have a protection racket or something.”He added: “Why should a civilized government want an ideal untraceable technology to come into the payment system run by a bunch of people who want to get rich quick for doing very little for civilization. Of course, I hate it.” Munger elaborated:I don’t think it’s good that our country is going crazy over bitcoin and its ilk. I think the Communist Chinese were wiser than we were. They just banned it.He was also asked if he had any predictions on what’s going to happen with crypto in the U.S.“No,” he replied. “You let a bad genie out of a bottle, God knows what happens.” The Berkshire executive opined:It was a huge mistake to allow it at all.Munger proceeded to comment on crypto regulation. “The truth of the matter is our regulatory establishment when they quit the government, they go out into this heavily promotional capitalism and so it’s very hard to get the government to make good, wise decisions about something like bitcoin.”At the Daily Journal meeting, Munger reiterated: “I wish it [crypto] had been banned immediately, and I admire the Chinese for banning it.” He continued:I certainly didn’t invest in crypto. I’m proud of the fact I’ve avoided it. It’s like a venereal disease or something. I just regard it as beneath contempt.Munger’s statements echo his previous comments about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He said in December last year: “I’m never going to buy a cryptocurrency. I wish they’d never been invented.”He also advised other investors to never buy BTC. In May, he said: “The whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interest of civilization.”What do you think about Charlie Munger’s comments about bitcoin and crypto?

87,"Bitcoin Hashrate Hits Another Milestone, Network's Mining Difficulty Taps 13-Year High","Feb 17, 2022","The processing power backing the Bitcoin network has continued its upward momentum tapping another all-time high (ATH) on February 15, 2022, at 249 exahash per second (EH/s). Following the latest ATH, the network’s mining difficulty increased on Thursday morning (EST), up 4.78% and reaching a value of 27.97 trillion. The mining difficulty has increased six times in a row since November 28, 2021, which makes it 23.34% harder for bitcoin miners to find bitcoin block rewards since then. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate is coasting along at 212.21 EH/s after cracking a new ATH on Tuesday, February 15. On that day, the hashrate climbed to 249.75 EH/s, according to coinwarz.com’s six-month statistics. The new ATH follows the high recorded three days prior when the hashpower metric tapped 246 exahash per second (EH/s) on February 12. After the new 249 EH/s high on Thursday, the network’s difficulty increased by 4.78% to another lifetime high.At the time of writing and for the next 13 days, the mining difficulty will be approximately 27.97 trillion. It’s a lot higher than the low difficulty value recorded 215 days (seven months) ago on July 17, 2021. At that time, BTC’s network difficulty was only 13.67 trillion because it experienced four decreases in a row — one of them being the largest decrease in history on July 3, 2021 (-27.94%). However, since July 17, there have been 16 different difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) changes and 15 of them increased. The last decrease recorded in the seven-month spread was on November 28, 2021, dropping 1.49%. The jump from 13.67 trillion to the current 27.97 trillion is an increase of 104.60% in seven months. The hashrate seven months ago was less than half the value it is today, at 97.87 EH/s.While bitcoin miners have recorded another ATH, the top pool during the last three days is Foundry USA with 15.59% of the global hashrate and 33.62 EH/s. The second-largest miner during the last three days is F2pool with 14.76% of the world’s hashrate and 31.83 EH/s. Foundry USA and F2pool are followed by Antpool, Poolin, Binance Pool, Viabtc, Slushpool, Btc.com, SBI Crypto, and Luxor, respectively.There are 12 entities dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain and 11 of them are known pools. Currently, unknown hashrate or stealth miners have the least amount of hashrate with 0.83% of the global hashrate, or 1.79 EH/s of dedicated SHA256 hashpower.With the current global hashrate coasting along above the 200 EH/s range, the next epoch DAA estimated to come in 13 days is currently expected to be another increase. While the estimate could change, right now it’s expected to jump 0.04% from the current 27.97 trillion to 27.98 trillion.What do you think about the hashrate reaching new highs and the difficulty increasing close to 5% on Thursday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

88,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC, ETH Prices Fall Lower Against USD","Feb 17, 2022","Cryptocurrency markets were trading lower for a second consecutive session, leaving bitcoin and ethereum both in the red. Overall, the crypto market cap was nearly 2% lower as of writing. Bitcoin bulls were nowhere to be found on Thursday, as bearish pressure continued to dominate recent market sentiment. Following a high of $44,309.03 on Wednesday, BTC/USD fell below $43,000 during today’s session, and is down by over 3% as of writing.The move saw BTC hit an intraday low of $42,685.75, sending prices closer to recent support at $41,765.This drop in price comes as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 14-days fell below its floor of 56, and is currently tracking at 53.10.In addition to the decline in price strength, the shorter term moving average of 10-days (red), is trending downward for the first time since January 30. Despite BTC being down 3.33% in the last seven days, history shows us that the closer we get to support, bulls will likely be waiting to buy the dip.Following a battle to remain over the $3,000 level on Wednesday, ETH struggled to stay above water during today’s session. ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $2,987 on Thursday, following a breakout of its long-term support at $3,022. Although prices have since moved back above $3,000, this was a sign to bears that there could yet be further declines. Many are looking at the $2,840 floor as the next price target, should the current bearish pressure persistLooking at the RSI, price strength remains near the floor of 51, despite a marginal breakout, which could be a good sign to bulls anticipating a reversal.How long will this bearish pressure last?

89,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Remains Above $3,000 as Markets Consolidate","Feb 16, 2022","Following yesterday’s rally in crypto, prices consolidated on Wednesday, as markets were once again fearful of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The uncertainty came as NATO reported that Russia was increasing troops on the border, as opposed to sending some home. BTC, which looked set for a breakout of the $45,000 level yesterday, fell on hump-day, sending the global crypto market cap 1.40% lower in the process. The price of bitcoin hit a high of $44,667.22 on Tuesday, however today dropped to an intraday low of $43,622.02, as markets look set for consolidation.Markets have been fixated with $46,000 as the long-term resistance, however a shorter-term ceiling at $44,800 seems to be the main obstacle to overcome. This drop in price has led to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 14-days falling to 56, a level which seems to be a support point.Although price strength has yet to fall below this level, if it does, markets will likely see an influx of bears pushing BTC/USD to the floor.This floor is located around the $41,800 region, and we could see this tested if current price momentum persists.Ethereum was also lower on Wednesday, however marginally managed to remain above its key level of $3,000.Yesterday, ETH/USD broke past its recent resistance level of $3,022 and looked set for a run towards its higher ceiling of $3,290.However, that move was cut short, and a reversal in momentum sent ETH to an intraday low of $3,072.03 instead.Despite this decline in price, the 14-day RSI has still yet to hit its long-term floor at 51, and is currently tracking at 53. This could either be positive for bulls hoping for a reversal, or bears waiting for further downward pressure. Is this a perfect time to buy the dip? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

90,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Surges Towards $45,000 as Russia Withdraws 'Some' Troops","Feb 15, 2022","Following four consecutive sessions of declines, bitcoin rallied late on Monday, into Tuesday, as it was reported that Russia was withdrawing some troops from the Ukrainian border. Overall, crypto markets are up close to 5% on the day.BTC finally rebounded during Tuesday’s session, as bulls once again re-entered the race to $45,000. Following a low of $41,928.19 yesterday, BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $44,331.96 on Tuesday, with many now expecting further short-term increases in price.Today’s rally came as prices moved away from support which was close to $41,000, helped by the increase in momentum. This rise in momentum came as the short-term 10-day (red) moving average appears to have moved away from its recent horizontal path, and now seems to be trending upward.In addition to this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) broke the resistance of 56.43, which as outlined yesterday, was a key obstacle preventing bulls from re-entering.Now that this has happened, the RSI is currently tracking at 61, however, a new hurdle could be awaiting it at the 65.20 area.Aside from this, the skies look relatively clear as the price of bitcoin looks to fly toward resistance of $45,000.Ethereum was also higher on Tuesday, as bulls once again pushed prices above the $3,000 level.ETH/USD broke past its recent resistance level of $3,022 today, as it hit an intraday high of $3,115.69 earlier in the session.As of writing, ETH was over 6% higher on the day, with the 14-day RSI also moving beyond its ceiling at 51.64, and is currently four points away from the next point of uncertainty.Today’s move comes following a low of $2,867.31 to start the week, however with this new-found momentum, ethereum bulls could likely be targeting the $3,300 region.Similar to BTC, the 10-day moving average seems to have been boosted by today’s swing, which will likely give bulls further confidence. Can today’s momentum continue throughout the week? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

At the end of July last year, there was 2.59 million bitcoin held by crypto trading platforms, and today there’s only 2.36 million held by exchanges, which means there’s 8.8% fewer bitcoin on exchanges than six months ago.According to current statistics, there’s 2.363 million bitcoin, or $100 billion worth, of the leading crypto asset held on exchanges. The current value of the bitcoin (BTC) held by centralized exchanges equates to 12.36% of BTC’s overall $809 billion market capitalization.While 2.363 million is a significant fraction, it’s 8.88% less than the number of bitcoins held on exchanges on July 25, 2021. Too many crypto market participants, and the fact that there’s less BTC on exchanges means less selling pressure going forward.Metrics indicate that the last time bitcoin exchange reserves were this low was ten months ago, back in April 2021. Combined statistics from Bituniverse, Peckshield, Etherscan, and Chain.info show that the exchange Coinbase holds the most bitcoin (BTC) today with 853,530 BTC held in reserves.The value of Coinbase’s BTC holdings equates to 35% of the current $100 billion worth of BTC held on exchanges. Binance is the second-largest bitcoin holder, in terms of exchanges, with 339,870 BTC worth $14.5 billion using current bitcoin exchange rates.Meanwhile, the same can be said about the number of ethereum (ETH) held on centralized exchanges. Data from cryptoquant.com shows there’s 17 million ether held on exchanges today, but that amount has been sliding significantly since May 2021. In May last year, crypto exchanges held 21.9 million ethereum.This means roughly 22.37% of the ETH held on exchanges has left the market environment for alternative solutions. On the other hand, much of the ETH that has left centralized exchanges since last May could have been transferred to decentralized exchange (dex) platforms.Currently, the most active crypto exchange in terms of ether trade volume, Binance, holds 3.59 million ETH in reserves. While less BTC and ETH on exchanges could lead to less selling pressure, metrics show that BTC miners have been selling bitcoin.Miner holdings, according to Glassnode data, went negative on February 5, 2022, for the first time in two months. At the time of writing, cryptoquant.com statistics indicate there’s roughly 1.86 million BTC held by mining entities.What do you think about the number of bitcoin held on crypto exchange trading platforms?

93,"Bitcoin Hashrate Surges Tapping Lifetime High, Foundry Commands Top Mining Pool Rank for 30 Days","Feb 14, 2022","The processing power backing the Bitcoin network has tapped another all-time high (ATH) in 2022, reaching 246 exahash per second (EH/s) on February 12. After the network reached an ATH on January 15, a month later the hashrate increased by 12.43% — this despite the network’s mining difficulty coasting along at record highs as well.Bitcoin mining participants tapped a record high on Saturday, February 12, 2022, as the hashrate reached an ATH of 246.80 EH/s. So far, the hashrate has seen three consecutive ATHs in 2022 with the first record broken on January 1. Two weeks later, the hashrate tapped another ATH at 219.5 EH/s.The record on Saturday was 12.43% higher than the January 15 metric and currently, the hashrate has been coasting along at 239.48 EH/s. The hashrate high is taking place while bitcoin’s price has dropped 38.4% lower than the $69K high on November 10. Furthermore, the network’s difficulty is the highest it’s ever been as well, which means it’s more difficult than ever before to find a BTC block subsidy.At the time of writing, the network’s mining difficulty is approximately 26.69 trillion, and it’s expected to increase 3.33% in three days. On January 20, the mining difficulty jumped 9.32% higher and two weeks later, on February 3, it increased by 0.18%.Currently, out of the 21 million maximum supply, 18,957,962 bitcoin have been mined into existence. During the last three days, the bitcoin mining pool Foundry USA has been the biggest pool in terms of hashrate. Foundry USA has captured 20.16% of the global hashrate, finding 101 block rewards with 41.45 EH/s.Foundry is followed by Poolin (29.14 EH/s), F2pool (24.63 EH/s), Antpool (24.22 EH/s), and Viabtc (22.16 EH/s) respectively. Foundry has been the top miner for 30 days as well, with 17% of the global hashrate finding 758 block rewards.As BTC’s hashrate is riding at its highest levels in over 13 years, 12 known mining pools are mining the leading crypto asset while stealth miners (unknown hashrate) command 1% (2.05 EH/s) of the network’s hashrate.What do you think about the Bitcoin network’s hashrate reaching an all-time high on Saturday?

94,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC, ETH Prices Volatile Following Super Bowl","Feb 14, 2022","Cryptocurrencies were initially in the red to start the week, despite several crypto firms securing lucrative Super Bowl ad slots. Over 100 million viewers watched the “crypto bowl” advertisements, however bitcoin prices started lower on Monday.BTC/USD is lower for a fifth consecutive session to start the week, as markets gave up all of last week’s gains. BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $41,681.96 on Monday, following a peak of $42,693.05 during Sunday’s session.The recent decline in prices has pushed BTC closer to support of $40,800, a level it hasn’t hit since February 5. Monday’s move comes as price strength has continued to slip, with the 14-day RSI falling below recent multi-month highs. As of writing, the Relative Strength Index is tracking at 55, a level which appears to be a short-term floor, however should it move above resistance of 56.43, bulls could re-enter. Looking at the moving averages on 10-days and 25-days, we are starting to see a consolidation in momentum, as these trend lines begin to trend sideways. Although it seems likely that the floor will be hit, long-term traders will likely look at buying this dip.Ethereum was also lower to start the week, as bears continued to circle the world’s second largest cryptocurrency.However, as the session progressed, prices slowly began to gain some bullish momentum, following the U.S. open.As of writing, ETH was marginally higher, as prices were once again looking to trade above the $3,000 level. ETH/USD hit an intraday low of $2,840.26 during the course of today’s session, however it climbed to a high of $2,957.96 shortly thereafter, which is 0.24% higher than Sunday’s high.This comes as the 14-day Relative Strength Index was marginally higher, and approaching its key resistance level of 51. Similar to BTC, the moving averages on ETH/USD have begun to trend sideways, however, many still remain optimistic of a future rally, should we once again break the $3,022 resistance.Will we see an influx of new crypto traders following the Super Bowl?

95,Russian Regulators Find Common Ground — Bitcoin Can’t Be Used for Payments,"Feb 13, 2022","Russian authorities are yet to reach full consensus on the future of cryptocurrencies but government institutions are on the same side of the fence in their intention to ban bitcoin payments. Other operations with digital assets are to be legalized and regulated, representatives of Russian business have revealed. The Central Bank of Russia, the Ministry of Finance and the government have converged on the question of how to regulate Russia’s crypto space. Decentralized digital currencies will not be accepted as a means of payment, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) Alexander Shokhin told reporters following a meeting devoted to digitalization.Last month, Bank of Russia urged for a wide-ranging ban of crypto-related activities, including their use in payments, exchange and mining. The hardline policy proposal was met with opposition from other institutions, including the finance ministry which came up with its own vision of how cryptocurrencies should be treated. Siding with the treasury’s stance, the federal government adopted a plan which favors regulation over prohibition.“It is already clear that both sides in this discussion have generally come closer. In particular, if we are talking about prohibitions, then that is rather about a ban on the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment, while other aspects are subject to regulation,” Shokhin was quoted as saying by the daily Izvestia. According to the government-approved regulatory concept, coins can be bought, exchanged, and sold, the report notes.Vladimir Potanin, co-chairman of RSPP’s Coordinating Council and president of Nornickel, noted that the regulatory bodies are still seeking agreement on the details of Russia’s crypto framework but he emphasized that all of them support a ban on the use of cryptocurrency as a legal tender.“The business community has reached an understanding with the government, the central bank and lawmakers that cryptocurrencies are more complicated and difficult to regulate than digital financial assets,” the billionaire elaborated, quoted by Forklog.While regulating certain aspects of the crypto economy such as the issuance of tokens, the Russian law “On Digital Financial Assets,” which went into force in January of last year, left many unanswered questions. A working group at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is now preparing legislation to fill the gaps.A new law introducing comprehensive rules for the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia, based on the finance ministry’s proposals, is expected by Feb. 18. Earlier this week, the chairman of the Financial Market Committee Anatoly Aksakov announced that a draft is already on his desk. Deputies plan to adopt it during the spring session of the Duma.Do you expect Russia to regulate cryptocurrencies by the parliament’s summer recess? Tell us in the comments section below.

Aspiring rapper Heather Morgan and her husband, Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein, were arrested in New York this week. The Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized 94,636 bitcoins stolen from the Bitfinex hack.
American subscription streaming service and production company Netflix announced Friday that it “has ordered a documentary series about a married couple’s alleged scheme to launder billions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency in the biggest criminal financial crime case in history.”The company explained that Chris Smith — famed for directing “FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened” and “Tiger King” — is set to direct and executive produce the Bitfinex documentary series.In addition, writer and producer Nick Bilton — famed for “Fake Famous,” “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,” and “American Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road” — is set to executive produce the Bitfinex documentary series.The documentary will be about the couple who allegedly laundered bitcoin worth over $4 billion from a 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.Netflix described:Ilya ‘Dutch’ Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan were arrested in their New York City apartment on Tuesday, February 8, and now face charges of conspiring to launder nearly 120,000 Bitcoin tied to the 2016 hack of a virtual currency exchange.While Lichtenstein, who holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, co-founded Mixrank, a Y-Combinator backed startup, Morgan is an aspiring rapper under the name Razzlekahn.The 31-year-old rapper and former Forbes contributor described herself as an “irreverent comedic rapper” and “crocodile of Wall Street.” The videos of her rapping were widely mocked on social media after her arrest.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday that Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Morgan, 31, have been arrested for “alleged conspiracy to launder $4.5 billion in stolen cryptocurrency” from the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Specifically, court documents show that they “allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin” that were stolen from the cryptocurrency exchange.The DOJ also seized 94,636 BTC from them, which the department described as the “largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, valued at more than $3.6 billion” at the time of the seizure. At the time of writing, the value of the BTC seized is more than $4 billion.The court documents further detail the couple’s “numerous sophisticated laundering techniques,” including using fictitious identities to set up online accounts, using computer programs to automate transactions, depositing stolen funds into accounts at various cryptocurrency exchanges and darknet markets, and leveraging “anonymity-enhanced virtual currency (AEC), in a practice known as ‘chain hopping.'”Will you watch Netflix’s documentary series about this couple who allegedly laundered bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack?

Bitcoin was also lower, giving up some of this week’s gains in the process. Following a surge to a high above $45,000 to start the week, bitcoin prices fell for a third straight session, as bullish pressure seems to have calmed. BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $41,892.20 on Saturday, following a peak of $43,810.83 during yesterday’s session.After attempting to breach the $44,750 resistance on Thursday, bitcoin’s price strength has weakened, moving closer to oversold territory. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently tracking at 54, following a high of 65 only 2-days ago.This level of 54 appears to be a short-term floor, leading many to wait and see if it holds, which could then entice bulls to maintain open positions. Despite the current bearish sentiment surrounding markets, price momentum, especially short-term, still trends higher, with BTC/USD still marginally up in the last seven days.Bears will certainly continue to test this trend. The decline of ethereum continued on Saturday, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency fell below its key support level.ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $2,888.66 today, which is the lowest price ETH has seen since February 4. This eight-day low comes as price strength fell into oversold territory, breaking below the neutral zone of 50 on the 14-day Relative Strength Index.Recent momentum has meant that ETH is trading over 3% lower in the last seven days, wiping out sizable gains made during the week.Could ETH be moving towards support of $2,600?

98,Billionaire Bill Miller Has 'Very Big' Bitcoin Position — Calls BTC 'Insurance Against Financial Catastrophe',"Feb 11, 2022","Veteran investor and fund manager Bill Miller says he has “a very big position” in bitcoin and expects to see a lot of institutional adoption this year, particularly among endowments and foundations. “Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe,” he opined.
Famed value investor Bill Miller talked about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. He is the founder of Miller Value Partners and currently serves as its chairman and chief investment officer. He manages the firm’s Opportunity Equity and Income Strategy funds. Prior to Miller Value Partners, he co-founded Legg Mason Capital Management.Referring to bitcoin, Miller described, “It’s like an insurance policy.” He elaborated: “Insurance policies have no intrinsic value. In fact, you want them to have no intrinsic value. You don’t want to have your house burned down or get in a terrible accident but you pay for insurance every year in case that happens.” Miller continued:Bitcoin is insurance against financial catastrophe as we see in Lebanon, or in Afghanistan, or many of these other countries where we saw around the time of the pandemic.Miller also clarified what he said in January about bitcoin being half of his net worth, noting that many media reports misinterpreted what he said. Miller explained that he only put a few percent of his net worth into bitcoin which then grew to become half of his total fortune as the price of the cryptocurrency soared. However, he added that now BTC accounts for less than half of his total net worth because the price has fallen since its high in November.“I put a few percent of my net worth in it a long time ago and it grew to be half of my net worth. Now it’s less than that because it’s down half since November. But it’s still a very big position,” he said.Commenting on KPMG Canada buying bitcoin and ether for its corporate treasury, Miller said he sees the move as bullish for the crypto sector. The billionaire fund manager opined:I think you’re going to see a lot of adoption among foundations and endowments and institutions this year, and that’s going to continue.The veteran investor has long been pro-bitcoin. In September last year, his hedge fund company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a filing that bitcoin has “significant upside potential” as digital gold.When the price of bitcoin fell in May last year, he was unfazed by the falling price, emphasizing that bitcoin price corrections are pretty common.What do you think about Bill Miller’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

99,"13 Years Ago Today, Satoshi Nakamoto Published the First Forum Post Introducing Bitcoin","Feb 11, 2022","13 years ago today, the creator of the Bitcoin network, Satoshi Nakamoto published the inventor’s first forum post on the P2P Foundation website. The forum post called “Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency” introduced the e-cash system to the members of the advocacy and research forum focused on peer-to-peer dynamics in society.There was three occasions in February 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the inventor’s Bitcoin white paper and open source codebase to the P2P Foundation forum members. The occasion on February 11, 2009, was the first time the creator of Bitcoin publicly announced the project using the P2P Foundation forum. Prior to these instances during the month of February, Nakamoto leveraged the email system tethered to the cryptography mailing list hosted on metzdowd.com.The introductory forum post is quite fascinating, and the inventor also leaves a link to the software’s first version on the forum as well. “I’ve developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin,” Nakamoto wrote 13 years ago today. “It’s completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper,” the creator added.Nakamoto is extremely descriptive in the first forum post, and Bitcoin’s inventor explains the issue with conventional currencies. “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” Nakamoto wrote that day. “The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”Bitcoin’s inventor further stressed:We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.Anyone who reads the first forum post Satoshi wrote, can understand that the inventor is trying to get the word out, so more people can test the Bitcoin network during the earliest days. Nakamoto’s forum post did not get a reply until the very next day, as an individual named Sepp Hasslberger was the first to respond to Nakamoto’s first P2P Foundation thread.“Great stuff,” Hasslberger wrote at the time. “This is the first real innovation in money since the Bank of England started to issue its promissory notes for gold in the vaults, which then became known as banknotes. I believe an open source currency has great potential. A bit like Google becoming the default search engine for many of us,” Hasslberger added. A few other individuals in the post talked about “old Chaumian central stuff” and e-currency projects such as e-gold that failed in the past.Satoshi responded to a few questions in the thread and noted that the “old Chaumian central mint stuff,” was the only thing available at the time. Bitcoin’s inventor reminded the P2P Foundation members that the Bitcoin protocol was decentralized and different. “A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s,” Nakamoto replied to one of the thread’s responses on February 15, 2009. “I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system,” the cryptocurrency’s creator added.On February 18, Nakamoto came back to the thread to answer multiple questions asked by inquisitive Sepp Hasslberger at the time. In response to Hasslberger’s questions, Nakamoto laid out three interesting features the Bitcoin network showcased and insisted that the coins would be scarce. Nakamoto said:It is a global distributed database, with additions to the database by consent of the majority, based on a set of rules they follow: [One] — Whenever someone finds proof-of-work to generate a block, they get some new coins. [Two] — The proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted every two weeks to target an average of 6 blocks per hour (for the whole network). [Three] — The coins given per block is cut in half every 4 years — You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount.It’s safe to say that Satoshi Nakamoto’s e-cash system caught on and after 13 years, 18,954,937 bitcoins have been issued out of the maximum supply of 21 million so far. Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization is currently worth more than $800 billion and since its inception on January 3, 2009, the network has been functional with a 99.98713391230% uptime rating. Nakamoto’s invention has also sparked the creation of thousands of crypto coins, and today there’s 12,523 crypto assets within the crypto economy.What do you think about the first forum post written by Satoshi Nakamoto on the P2P Foundation forum?

Bitcoin and ethereum are both lower, giving up some of this week’s gains in the process.Bitcoin followed up Thursday’s volatile session with even more uncertainty today, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency was once again falling. Following a rise to $45,101.17 yesterday, BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $42,864.32 earlier in today’s session, as it appeared that bears were pushing prices towards support.The selloff started after resistance of $44,750 was held during yesterday’s session, with bears piling in, in order to short bitcoin.This comes as the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has flatlined, and is currently tracking at 60, which is still overbought.Some believe with price strength uncertain, BTC/USD could go either way, depending on how momentum begins to mature.As constructed, the short-term ten-day (red) moving average still looks to be bullish, helped by the current ascending triangle which has formed in recent weeks.Bulls will now likely wait to see if this will be enough to inspire fellow buyers to re-enter.Ethereum is trading close to 5% lower as of writing, as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency looks set for consolidation.ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $3,018.56 on Friday, which is the lowest price ETH has hit this week.This selloff from resistance of $3,285 pushed ethereum marginally below its recent support level of $3,022, however, the move appears to be a false break.Recent momentum shows that prices are hitting a streak of higher highs, as seen by the ascending triangle, however a wall seems to have been hit, stopping further progression..Could bulls use today’s low as a chance to “buy the dip”?

Global investment bank JPMorgan has revealed its prediction for the long-term price of bitcoin as well as the cryptocurrency’s fair value.JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a research note published Tuesday that their long-term theoretical target for bitcoin is $150K, up from $146K predicted last year.At this level, bitcoin’s total market value would be on par with that of all gold held privately for investment purposes, they explained.The analysts clarified that bitcoin’s “fair value” is around $38K, up from $35K estimated last year.They calculated the coin’s fair value based on bitcoin being roughly four times as volatile as gold, adding that if the volatility differential narrows to three times, then the fair value of BTC would rise to $50K.The JPMorgan strategists wrote:The biggest challenge for bitcoin going forward is its volatility and the boom and bust cycles that hinder further institutional adoption.At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is $43,855 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. BTC is up almost 19% over the past seven days and almost 5% in the last 30 days.Meanwhile, a JPMorgan client survey shows that the majority of respondents expect bitcoin’s price to reach $60K or more this year. The firm currently offers some crypto investments to clients.Nonetheless, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon continues to warn people about investing in crypto, citing that the assets have no intrinsic value. He called bitcoin worthless in October last year, questioning its limited supply.What do you think about JPMorgan’s bitcoin price prediction? Let us know in the comments section below.

102,Fitch Ratings Downgrades El Salvador Deeper Into Junk Status Citing Bitcoin Risks,"Feb 10, 2022","One of the largest rating agencies in the U.S., Fitch Ratings, has downgraded El Salvador’s long-term default rating deeper into junk status, citing risks from adopting bitcoin as legal tender as a key reason. “The adoption of bitcoin as legal tender has added uncertainty about the potential for an IMF program that would unlock financing for 2022-2023,” Fitch detailed.
Fitch Ratings downgraded El Salvador’s Long Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) from “B-” to “CCC” Wednesday. The American credit rating agency is one of the Big Three credit rating agencies. The other two are Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P).For Fitch, bonds rated AAA, AA, A, or BBB are considered investment grade, while those rated BB, B, CCC, CC, C, or D are considered speculative, or junk grade, bonds. The company explained that CCC ratings mean “Substantial credit risk” with “Very low margin for safety,” and that “Default is a real possibility.”The rating agency explained:In Fitch’s view, weakening of institutions and concentration of power in the presidency have increased policy unpredictability, and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender has added uncertainty about the potential for an IMF program that would unlock financing for 2022-2023.The rating agency also said that “heightened financing risks stemming from increased reliance on short-term debt” ahead of an $800 million global bond payment due next January influenced its decision to cut El Salvador’s rating.In July, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the government of El Salvador’s long-term foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B3 to Caa1. The agency stated that El Salvador’s “outlook remains negative,” citing concerns over the use of bitcoin as legal tender in the country.El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year. Since then, the government of El Salvador has bought 1,801 bitcoins.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently urged El Salvador to drop bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF also wants El Salvador to dissolve its fund used for conversion between bitcoin and dollars, noting the costs of adopting bitcoin as a national currency exceed the benefits. El Salvador, however, rejected the IMF’s call to abandon bitcoin as legal tender.What do you think about Fitch Ratings downgrading El Salvador deeper into junk due to bitcoin risks? Let us know in the comments section below.

103,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH, BTC Volatile as US Inflation Hits 40-Year High","Feb 10, 2022","Prices of ethereum and bitcoin were volatile on Thursday, as markets reacted to U.S. inflation data. Bitcoin briefly recaptured the $45,000 level, but sold off after the data was released. Bitcoin started the day in the green, hitting the $45,000 mark in the process, however as the U.S. equity session opened, prices weighed, as it was reported that consumer prices had risen to 7.5%. BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $45,101.17 earlier in today’s session, as it appeared that bulls were pushing prices up for a second day.The move saw bitcoin marginally break out of the $44,750 resistance level, however this ceiling held firm, pushing prices to a low of $43,402.81.This was the third consecutive false break of this resistance, as the bullish pressure from Monday’s session marginally remained throughout the week. Price strength has also deteriorated, with the 14-day RSI now tracking at 60, which although still being overbought, is below yesterday’s high of 64.Despite recent volatility, bullish pressure remains, with the moving averages of ten and 25 days still positioned for further upside momentum. Ethereum was trading at a multi-week high to start the session, however, similar to BTC, prices fell following inflation data. As of writing, ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $3,126.64 on Thursday, as a short-term ceiling of $3,270 halted today’s attempted price surge. This selloff from resistance pushed ETH towards its recent support of $3,022, which is a level it hasn’t hit since Tuesday. Many who remain bullish will likely maintain positions up until price strength falls below the 56 level on the RSI. Is today’s drop in ETH only a temporary setback?

104,"Ukrainian Volunteer Groups Accept Bitcoin Donations Amid Tensions With Russia, Study Finds","Feb 10, 2022","Non-government and volunteer organizations collecting funds to support Ukrainian forces have been accepting donations in cryptocurrency, a new report has unveiled. The findings have been published amid heightened tensions with Russia, which has been accused of amassing troops at the border with Ukraine.Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups have raised several hundred thousand dollars in cryptocurrency, a study by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has revealed. Donations made in digital assets have increased by 900% last year, the company’s researchers found.Most of these groups were founded during the Maidan revolution in 2014 when they helped protesters. Since the annexation of Crimea by Russia, they have been supporting Ukraine’s war effort against pro-Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region by sending volunteers, weapons, and supplies.In the past few years, the organizations have received millions of dollars in fiat money through bank wires and payment apps. Meanwhile, bitcoin has become an alternative funding channel as it allows donors to circumvent restrictions imposed by the traditional financial system, the authors note.Elliptic has identified several crypto wallets used by the non-government organizations and volunteer groups and found they have received over $570,000 worth of digital coins in total. Most of the funds were transferred over the course of the past year.Among the groups accepting cryptocurrency is Come Back Alive, which supplies the Ukrainian army with military equipment, medical products, and provides training. It introduced the crypto option in 2018. The organization has received almost $200,000 in digital currency during the second half of 2021.Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, whose members have been engaged in cyberattacks on Russian targets since 2016, including against Russia’s defense ministry, takes only crypto donations. In the past year, it received close to $100,000 in BTC, LTC, ETH, and various stablecoins.The Belarus-based Cyber Partisans is another hacktivist collective accepting exclusively bitcoin. It took responsibility for a cyberattack on the Belarusian railroad’s systems, demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from the country. According to the report, it raised $84,000 in BTC in the past six months.Myrotvorets Center is an NGO headquartered in the Ukrainian capital that reveals information about persons working for Russia, from mercenaries to journalists. Since enabling crypto donations, after the closing of its Paypal account, it has accumulated at least $268,000 in BTC.While these organizations are often funded by private donors, some of them are believed to maintain close ties with the government in Kyiv. Thus, Ukraine joins other nations that have employed cryptocurrency to raise funds, Elliptic remarks.The report mentions Iran — which has been using bitcoin mining to monetize its energy reserves and crypto payments to bypass foreign sanctions — as well as North Korea, allegedly implicated in stealing digital coins to finance its weapons programs.The report notes that Russia has in fact used crypto for fundraising since the beginning of the conflict. A series of online campaigns which raised money for the pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine accepted cryptocurrency alongside fiat. One of them, conducted under the banner “Save the Donbass,” registered at least 68 bitcoin donations between 2014 and 2016.Do you expect crypto donations for Ukrainian volunteer groups to continue to increase?

105,Ricardo Salinas Pliego Hints at Elektra Group Selling Bitcoin in Its Stores,"Feb 10, 2022","Ricardo Salinas Pliego, president of the Salinas Group, owner of the Elektra Group stores, hinted at the possibility of the shops selling bitcoin. The executive stated that due to the regulations of the Central Bank of Mexico, his company cannot implement cryptocurrency integration in the Azteca Bank app. However, he did point out that Elektra could sell bitcoin as it is a commercial institution.Ricardo Salinas Pliego, one of the richest men in Mexico and president of the Salinas Group, mentioned the possibility of selling bitcoin in his popular Elektra Group department stores. The remarks were made in a recent Tiktok video, where Salinas commented about the difficulties of including bitcoin in different services due to the regulations of the Bank Of Mexico. On this, Salinas stated:The issue with the Banco Azteca app is that the regulatory pundits won’t let us, the Bank of Mexico won’t let us, but they’re all of them. The Ministry of Finance, the National Banking Commission… the government officials won’t let us.Salinas further explained that bitcoin is not liked by these institutions, and they are bound to comply with the laws until regulations change.Later in the clip, Salinas stated that stores of the Elektra Group could sell bitcoin as merchandise. This is because they are not under banking regulations, and don’t have to protect the money of their investors. The executive clarified:Elektra, being a commercial entity, is not regulated by banking authorities, it does not collect money and it does not have that problem of having to protect people’s deposits. Elektra can sell bitcoin as any merchandise, as it was a bike or a phone.Salinas Pliego has been a supporter of bitcoin since long ago. The executive recommended buying bitcoin last June, where he stated the asset had extraordinary properties. At the same time, he informed that his bank, Banco Azteca, was working to be the first financial institution in Mexico to take and offer financial services in bitcoin. However, the Finance Minister of Mexico, Arturo Herrera, quickly answered these intentions, clarifying that the use of cryptocurrencies was not allowed under the current regulations of the Mexican financial system.What do you think about the statements of Ricardo Salinas Pliego hinting at the possibility of selling bitcoin in Elektra Group stores?

106,"An In-Depth Look at the Couple Accused of Laundering 94,636 Bitcoin From the 2016 Bitfinex Hack","Feb 10, 2022","On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested two individuals that are accused of an “alleged conspiracy to launder” 94,636 bitcoins stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. Interestingly, both of the suspects are known individuals within the tech industry as Ilya Lichtenstein was the co-founder of Mixrank, a Y-Combinator backed startup and Heather Morgan was a writer for Forbes.The U.S. government announced the “largest cryptocurrency seizure to date” after the DOJ seized 94,636 bitcoins that were stolen in the August 2016 Bitfinex hack. On August 2, 2016, a hacker managed to breach Bitfinex and steal 120,000 bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin’s price shuddered 24 hours after the breach losing 22% in USD value during the course of the aftermath. At first, Bitfinex talked about reimbursing customers with a bail-in haircut plan, which means traders would only get a fraction of losses.Two weeks later after the 120,000 BTC was stolen, Bitfinex gave the crypto community an investigation update. Instead of following through with the haircut plan, Bitfinex introduced “recovery rights tokens,” in order to make amends with the customers who lost funds. The coins were called BFX tokens and by April 3, 2017, at 8 p.m. UST (4 p.m. EST), the crypto exchange revealed it had paid its debt in full. However, after this point in time, people stopped talking about the Bitfinex stolen bitcoins, but the addresses holding the coins were monitored.In June 2019, the thieves moved 170 BTC and then 300 BTC in August 2019. On May 21, 2020, 30 coins from the Bitfinex hack started moving, and had been transferred once again to another unknown address. On June 11, 2020, hackers moved stolen Bitfinex coins, as they transferred 416 bitcoin to an unknown address. About a week later, the thieves moved 2,500 bitcoins and in October 2020, the hackers transferred 2,034 BTC to unknown wallets.5,045 BTC was moved by the hackers on December 1, 2020, and then on April 14, 2021, thousands upon thousands of stolen Bitfinex bitcoins were transferred, and caught by blockchain parsers. But the most unusual move of them all was on February 1, 2022, when 94,643.29 bitcoin was consolidated into one address with no privacy-preserving tactics used. The moved bitcoins on February 1, represented 79.03% of the 119,756 BTC stolen on August 2, 2016.Following the odd transfer, the DOJ announced on February 8, 2022, that it seized approximately 94,636 bitcoins and arrested two individuals. The accused Bitfinex bitcoin money launderers were Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31. Both of the accused bitcoin launderers were well known in the tech community and did not hide their presence online. Lichtenstein was the co-founder and CEO of Mixrank, which is essentially a customer discovery platform that works with sales representatives. Mixrank and Lichtenstein managed to raise $1.5 million from Mark Cuban and other investors.Lichtenstein had no problem with public appearances and speaking in interviews about his entrepreneurship. Lichtenstein’s wife Heather Rhiannon Morgan was also not shy and was a contributor at Forbes, and wrote articles about things like cybercriminals. Morgan had close to 5,000 Instagram followers and she considered herself a street rapper and was called “Razzlekhan.” While performing and acting as her alter ego Razzlekhan, she also called herself “the Crocodile of Wall Street,” and the musician published a dedicated website.“Just like her fearless entrepreneurial spirit and hacker mindset, Razz shamelessly explores new frontiers of art,” the web portal razzlekhan.com says. In fact, links are littered all over the internet about Lichtenstein and Morgan, as they both had a lot of entrepreneurial spirit. Morgan’s Linkedin profile says she is a “Serial Entrepreneur, SaaS Investors, and Surrealist.” Lichtenstein studied psychology at the University of Wisconsin and worked for many marketing jobs. He also has a dual U.S. and Russian citizenship after living there during his youth. After Lichtenstein’s career at Mixrank, he allegedly worked for a “stealth security startup.” The duo’s marriage is fairly recent as well, as Morgan and Lichtenstein got married in November 2021.In addition to working for a “stealth security startup,” Lichtenstein was an angel investor at Demandpath. According to the website, Demandpath is “a boutique micro-fund investing in the next generation of promising technologies.” When the duo was arrested in Manhatten, the DOJ said that “thanks to the meticulous work of law enforcement, the department once again showed how it can and will follow the money, no matter what form it takes.” However, the DOJ did not disclose how the couple originally obtained the funds.The U.S. government also did not detail what will happen to the seized bitcoin (BTC), but it’s assumed the coins will be auctioned like prior seizures. While no one knows right now how Lichtenstein and Morgan first got involved with the Bitfinex hack bitcoins, the public is well aware that the duo did not hide or attempt to keep themselves secretive. The couple, who were married in November 2021, broke the news that they would wed in the summer months before the wedding.“[Heather Morgan is my] best friend and the woman of my dreams,” Lichtenstein said at the time.Currently, the couple remains in prison because court prosecutors say the duo “presents a serious risk of flight.” The court prosecutors’ filing claims Lichtenstein and Morgan may still possess 7,506 ill-gotten bitcoin (BTC). If true, that would leave $333.8 million using current BTC exchange rates at the duo’s disposal.“The investigation also showed that Lichtenstein and his wife, Morgan, engaged in extraordinarily complex laundering of a portion of the stolen funds stored in wallet 1CGA4s,” the filing details. “Specifically, beginning in or around January 2017, a portion of the stolen BTC moved out of wallet 1CGA4s in a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms.” The Washington judge presiding over the case halted the couple’s chance at bail after the prosecutors filed the flight risk concerns.What do you think about the couple accused of laundering the 94,636 bitcoin seized by the DOJ? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Many believe that the ceiling for price strength could be 68 on a daily chart, which may dent hopes for longer-term bulls, at least for now. Ethereum was approaching a three-week high during Wednesday’s session, as prices moved closer to their long-term resistance of $3,400. ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $3,163.40 on Tuesday, as bulls bought at support of $3,022. This move comes as the 14-day RSI is currently tracking at 59, which is its highest level since November 12, when prices were north of $4,400.Similar to BTC, the upside crossover with the moving averages has continued to mature, however with price strength currently overbought, bears may still be lurking.Will there be any further hurdles for ETH on the way to $3,400?

109,"US Seizes 94,636 Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack in 'Largest Crypto Seizure to Date' — 2 People Arrested","Feb 8, 2022","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced the seizure of 94,636 bitcoins directly linked to the 2016 hack of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. This is the DOJ’s “largest cryptocurrency seizure to date.” In addition, two people have been arrested in connection with the hack and stolen cryptocurrency.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday that the U.S. government has seized stolen cryptocurrency directly linked to the 2016 hack of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.According to the announcement, this is the DOJ’s “largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, valued at more than $3.6 billion” at the time of the seizure. At the time of writing, the value of the BTC seized is more than $4 billion. The Department of Justice wrote:Thus far, law enforcement has seized over $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency linked to that hack.In addition, two people — Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31 — have been arrested for “alleged conspiracy to launder $4.5 billion in stolen cryptocurrency” from the Bitfinex hack. Specifically, court documents show that they “allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin” that were stolen from the cryptocurrency exchange.In the 2016 Bitfinex hack, stolen bitcoins were transferred in more than 2,000 transactions to a crypto wallet controlled by Lichtenstein. Over the last five years, approximately 25,000 stolen BTC were transferred out of his crypto wallet “via a complicated money laundering process,” the DOJ noted, adding that some of the stolen funds were deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan.The remainder of the stolen funds, comprising approximately 94,636 bitcoins, remained in the wallet, the Justice Department further explained.“After the execution of court-authorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan, special agents obtained access to files within an online account controlled by Lichtenstein,” the DOJ detailed, elaborating:Those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from Bitfinex, and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94,000 bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex.FBI Deputy Director Paul M. Abbate opined: “Today’s case is a reminder that the FBI has the tools to follow the digital trail, wherever it may lead.”Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco commented:Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals.Lichtenstein and Morgan used “numerous sophisticated laundering techniques,” the complaint describes. The techniques included using fictitious identities to set up online accounts, using computer programs to automate transactions, depositing stolen funds into accounts at various cryptocurrency exchanges and darknet markets, and leveraging “anonymity-enhanced virtual currency (AEC), in a practice known as ‘chain hopping.'”“Lichtenstein and Morgan are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison,” the Justice Department concluded.What do you think about this case?

In the investor’s note, Fsinsight’s head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell, said the parabolic growth would be due to “legacy market capital entering the fold.”While last year’s $100K predictions went silent during the last month of 2021, bitcoin (BTC) price predictions are starting to appear again this year. According to the Fundstrat firm Fsinsight, BTC could increase by almost 500% from the current price point to around $200K per unit.The BTC price prediction stems from Fsinsight and the firm’s head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell. Both Fsinsight and Fundstrat are bullish about the upside potential of crypto assets as Fundstrat Global Advisors’ head of research recently insisted bitcoin still has “exponential growth ahead” of it.Fsinsight’s and Farrell’s investor’s note says times are different now that major businesses and “legacy market capital [is] entering the fold.” “This is much different from 2018 where tech stocks were still doing well but bitcoin sold off along with the rest of the crypto market cap,” Farrell explained. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s meeting in March as Fed chair Jerome Powell has hinted at raising benchmark interest rates.Fsinsight’s prediction notes that U.S. policymakers could bring some downside to the leading crypto asset’s price growth. “All assets can sell off and drop another 50% if the Fed hikes 4% tomorrow or next month,” Farrell remarked in the note. “But right now, as things stand, the upside to both bitcoin and [ethereum] is much larger than the downside.”Meanwhile, digital currency values have increased during the last week as bitcoin (BTC) has climbed over 12% and ethereum (ETH) jumped more than 13% over the last seven days. Fsinsight’s prediction also notes that ethereum has the potential to swell in USD value during the last half of 2022. Fsinsight’s investor’s note predicts ETH could climb close to 400% to around $12K per unit.What do you think about Fsinsight’s prediction about bitcoin and ethereum skyrocketing to new highs in H2 2022?

111,"Freedom Convoy Continues, Trudeau Begs Protestors to Stop, Fundraiser Raises $542K in Bitcoin","Feb 8, 2022","During the last week, a large number of truckers are still occupying the streets of Ottawa protesting the vaccine mandates. On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau begged protestors to stop the demonstration and said “It has to stop.” Meanwhile, after Gofundme shut down the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser, crypto advocates have raised 12.41 bitcoin worth $542K in order to help the truckers continue the protest. The Freedom Convoy 2022 is still ongoing as thousands of people have surrounded the parliament buildings in downtown Ottawa, Ontario. The protest started on January 29, as Canadian truckers objected to the new coronavirus vaccine and testing rules.On Monday, after falling ill with Covid-19, while being fully vaccinated and boosted, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed parliament for the first time since he caught the coronavirus last week. ​​”Individuals are trying to blockade our economy, our democracy, and our fellow citizens’ daily lives. It has to stop,” Trudeau insisted.Trudeau’s statements follow the American crowdfunding platform, Gofundme, shutting down the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser and telling the public it would be returning donations. The fundraiser raised $9 million for the truckers before Gofundme shut it down and the decision was met with criticism. After Gofundme reversed the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser, Florida governor Ron DeSantis promised to investigate Gofundme’s decision. “I will work with [Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody] to investigate these deceptive practices,” DeSantis said.Three days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on cryptocurrency advocates reacting to Gofundme’s decision and two crypto-infused fundraisers. A Bitcoin cash (BCH) supporter started a Flipstarter fundraiser in order to raise 100 BCH for the truckers and so far, the Flipstarter has raised 24.10 BCH or close to $8K using today’s exchange rates. Another fundraiser our newsdesk reported on was crafted by a Twitter account dubbed: “Honkhonk Hodl.”Honkhonk Hodl’s fundraiser — hosted on the Tally platform — has raised $541K or 12.41 bitcoin (BTC) so far and people can donate onchain or leverage the Lightning Network to send support. 53% of the BTC donors donated to the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser onchain, while the rest utilized the Lightning Network. According to an interview with one of the fundraiser’s founders and the Toronto Star reporters Alex McKeen and Grant LaFleche, the fund’s keys are being held by five different individuals.“At some point, we could hand it right off to the truckers, because the people that are donating their bitcoin, that’s what they want to happen,” one of the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser creators told the Toronto Star reporters. “We’ve only had one meeting. And, you know, it could be anything, and it could also go into when we could keep it as an endowment.”Furthermore, the bitcoin fundraiser was also noticed by Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. On the broadcast “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Carlson spoke about Gofundme’s decision to stop the fundraiser and how cryptocurrency supporters have stepped in.Carlson spoke about Honkhonk Hodl’s fundraiser hosted on the Tally platform and said: “Now, why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over, because governments don’t control crypto.” Carlson further added:[Bitcoin] goes from person A to person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two — It’s pretty appealing — And you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge, in this country and in Canada, want to make the U.S. dollar irrelevant, they’ll keep acting like this and soon it will be. Either way, it’s becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold that technology has on our human rights is decentralization.The world is watching what happens when a specific portion of society does not comply with the mandates stemming from the collective. So far, the trucker’s Freedom Convoy 2022 in Canada is continuing for its tenth consecutive day and freedom activists worldwide are cheering them on.The occupation in downtown Ottawa, Ontario has also moved toward the Ambassador Bridge which is the busiest border crossing in North America. Ambassador Bridge has shut down and traffic on I-75 and the service drive into Detroit, Michigan has been piling up since Monday evening.What do you think about the truckers continuing the protest for the tenth straight day and Justin Trudeau insisting it has to stop? What do you think about the 12.41 bitcoin raised for the Freedom Convoy? Let us know what you think about this story in the comments section below.

112,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC, ETH Consolidate After Monday’s Surge","Feb 8, 2022","Crypto markets marginally consolidated on Tuesday, following yesterday’s price surge which saw bitcoin and ethereum both rally to multi-week highs. BTC climbed to $45,000, with ETH moving to $3,200.Bitcoin prices were marginally below yesterday’s high, as profit takers look to have closed some of their positions. BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $45,293.87 during Monday’s session, however it’s tracking close to $43,354.61 today.Yesterday’s move, which now looks like a false break, moved beyond its recent resistance of $43,770, en route to its highest point since January 5. The moving averages of 10-days (red) and 25 days (blue) have crossed over on the upside, which many believe shows that the momentum may continue to surge until a true resistance is found.Should we see another swing, many could see this resistance as being close to the $50,000 level, which hasn’t been hit since late December.As of writing, prices have continued to fall, with a doji being formed in today’s chart.Following an intraday high of $3,219.47 on Monday, which was a three-week high, ETH was also consolidating during today’s session. As of writing, ETH/USD fell to a low of $3,062.51 on Tuesday, as bulls liquidated positions in the world’s second largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum now sits marginally above its old resistance level at $3,022, which seems to be forming a new floor. The 14-day RSI has also dropped below its resistance level of 56, and is currently tracking around 54. Similar to BTC, moving averages have also experienced an upside cross, which may give long-term bulls the confidence to maintain positions, despite the current short-term volatility.Will another ETH rally come this week?

114,Colombia Registers First Real Estate Purchase With Bitcoin,"Feb 8, 2022","The first real estate purchase with Bitcoin has been registered in Colombia last week. The company, called La Haus, sold one property in Santa Marta to a buyer that was not in Colombia at the time of the purchase. While Colombia is just starting to consider bitcoin for real estate payments, in neighboring countries like Venezuela, it is becoming more common to use crypto for such transactions.The real estate sector in Colombia has reached a milestone when it comes to cryptocurrency usage, after registering its first purchase with bitcoin. La Haus, an online real estate company, mediated in this purchase after having received a reserve payment for 0.03 BTC a month ago. The purchase was recently completed by a buyer that was not in Colombia, so the operation was completed using Lightning Network through Opennode, a payment processor.The purchase comes roughly one month after the company announced it would accept bitcoin for reservations and payments for each one of the apartments in Natura City, a development located in Santa Marta with 160 units ready to be sold.Executives at La Haus stated that they are working to expand and use these payments for developments all across the country. On this, Jehudi Castro, La Haus’ vice president of future and innovation stated:The fact that this type of transaction has taken only a month to be carried out in Colombia speaks of the unsatisfied need that existed. We are working to bring this type of alternative to the rest of the country, so that the payment methods and the way of investment, are not a barrier to access residential property.However, this is not the first time that La Haus has completed a cryptocurrency-based purchase. The company, which also has operations in Mexico, registered its first crypto purchase in January when a property in Mexico was acquired by a woman living in Peru.Cryptocurrency purchases in the real estate sector are also becoming more and more common in Latam countries like Venezuela, where cars and some properties are being sold for USDT. Last year, one of these purchases occurred in a coastal state of the country, where a buyer used USDT to acquire an apartment for $12,000.What do you think about the usage of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a payment method for real estate purchases?

116,Tesla Holding Bitcoin Worth $2 Billion — Sees Crypto as Both Investment and Liquid Alternative to Cash,"Feb 7, 2022","Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, has filed an annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showing bitcoin holdings with a fair value of almost $2 billion at the end of December. The company sees crypto as both an investment and liquid alternative to cash.
Tesla filed an annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Friday.“We continue adapting our investment strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other marketable securities, digital assets and providing product-related financing,” the company wrote, adding:The fair market value of our bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2021, was $1.99 billion.The report explains that Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in early 2021 and later accepted the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for certain products in some regions. However, the electric car company suspended accepting BTC in May last year. In October, Tesla told the SEC that it may restart accepting cryptocurrencies.Tesla’s latest financial statement shows that the company’s “carrying value” of its bitcoin at the end of December was $1.26 billion, which reflects cumulative impairments of $101 million. Tesla also “had $17.58 billion of cash and cash equivalents” as of Dec. 31. The company noted:In the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.The electric car company further told the SEC, “We may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and on our view of market and environmental conditions,” elaborating:We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash.Tesla’s 2021 annual report does not include income from the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE), which the company began accepting for payments for some merchandise in January this year. Elon Musk has said on several occasions that dogecoin is the best crypto for transactions while bitcoin is more suitable as a store of value.What do you think about Tesla holding $2 billion in bitcoin?

117,"Crypto Economy Recaptures $2 Trillion, Bitcoin Moves Back Into the World's Top 10 Most Valuable Assets","Feb 7, 2022","The crypto economy has jumped back above the $2 trillion mark after falling below that value in mid-January. Statistics indicate that the USD value of all 12,440 coins across 544 crypto exchanges is worth $2.08 trillion, up 5.2% during the last 24 hours.Digital currency values have increased a great deal during the last week which has, in turn, pushed the overall value of the entire crypto-economy northbound. This means more than $500 billion returned to the crypto economy after the market carnage in January. Statistics show on January 24, 2022, the value of all the cryptos in existence was around $1.5 trillion. Since that day, the crypto economy’s USD value swelled by more than 36% climbing to $2.08 trillion on February 7, 2022. While bitcoin (BTC) dominates by 39.4%, ethereum’s (ETH) market capitalization is 17.9% of the $2 trillion in value.Coins that helped push the crypto economy’s value northbound past $2 trillion include gala (GALA), quant (QNT), leo token (LEO), mina (MINA), zcash (ZEC), shiba inu (SHIB), near (NEAR), ethereum classic (ETC), osmosis (OSMO), and decentraland (MANA), respectively. The aforementioned tokens gained anywhere between 30.3% and 95.3% in value against the U.S. dollar in the last seven days.The $10.6 billion worth of privacy coins jumped 3.8% over the last day, the net value of smart contract platforms ($691B) jumped 3.3% in 24 hours. The $41.8 billion worth of meme coin assets jumped 11.8% during the last day as dogecoin and shiba inu saw gains between 7.1% and 24.1%. Additionally, the total value locked (TVL) in defi protocols jumped 2% during the last day, rallying above $220 billion on Monday morning. Ethereum’s defi TVL dominates by 61.17% or $134.92 billion total value locked.While the crypto economy has jumped over $2 trillion — as numerous tokens have seen significant gains and the TVL in defi rises — NFT sales have dropped this past week. Overall sales among 1,449,578 transactions and 309,418 traders amounted to $967.5 million over the week. The weekly NFT sales metric is down 7.83% compared to last week’s NFT sales, and sales on Ethereum are down 9.15%. However, the third and second-largest blockchains by NFT sales are up this week, as Solana NFT sales climbed 5.69% and Avalanche NFT sales jumped by 36.34%.With the crypto economy above the $2 trillion mark, the value is worth more than most market valuations today. The USD value of all 12,440 coins would be ranked just above the fourth most valuable global asset, Saudi Aramco’s (Tadawul: 2222) $1.973 trillion market capitalization. However, the crypto economy’s market cap is below the market caps of gold ($11.544T), Apple ($2.813T), and Microsoft ($2.293T). Bitcoin’s (BTC) market cap today is the ninth most valuable asset in terms of overall valuation with its $821.01 billion market cap.What do you think about the crypto economy surging past the $2 trillion mark? What do you think about bitcoin joining the world’s top ten most valuable assets? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Overall, crypto markets were around 3% higher on Monday. Bitcoin, which consolidated for the majority of last week, moved closer to a three-week high today, climbing by as much as 3% as of writing. BTC/USD rose to an intraday high above $43,500.00 during Monday’s session, as markets reacted to the news that Tesla currently holds $1.9 billion in bitcoin.The move came as bitcoin marginally broke out of its resistance level of $42,060 for the first time since January 21.

Bulls may take this as a sign to add more upward pressure to prices, with some targeting $45,000 as the next point of profit taking. ETH was also tracking at multi-week highs on Monday, as bulls continue to flock to the world’s second largest cryptocurrency.As of writing, ETH/USD climbed to a high of $3,111.16 today, after trading at $2,965.43 less than 24-hours ago.Overall, ethereum is up over 20% in the last week, coming as its 14-RSI broke beyond two key resistance levels in that time. The first break came after a break above 44 on February 3, followed by Saturday’s surge above the 55 ceiling.These moves have created a shift in both the 10-day and 25-day moving averages, which, similar to BTC, is set for a crossover.Is ETH now headed to a resistance of $3,400?

119,The Miner Capitulation Number: A Look at When Bitcoin’s Price Crashed Below the Cost of Production,"Feb 7, 2022","Over the last 30 days, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been coasting along at the highest levels ever recorded during the network’s lifetime. Bitcoin’s price improved recently but it is still down 38% from the crypto asset’s high, making bitcoin less profitable to mine. However, bitcoin mining is still profitable, in contrast to ten years ago, when the leading crypto asset’s value crashed below the cost of production.While bitcoin’s price value has climbed quite high against the U.S. dollar during the last 13 years, the network’s hashrate has also risen to all-time highs. Today, the hashrate is coasting along above two hundred quintillion hashes per second (H/s) which is a lot stronger than the Bitcoin network’s hashrate was on January 5, 2009. On that day, statistics show that nine hundred forty-eight thousand H/s was dedicated to the protocol’s security. Calculations show Bitcoin’s hashrate has increased by twenty-one quadrillion percent — or 21,093,375,098,215,930% — since January 5, 2009.Bitcoin’s hashrate is coasting along at all-time highs, but the crypto asset’s value is 38% lower than it was three months ago, on November 10, 2021. This in turn has made it less profitable to mine bitcoin (BTC), but still profitable for a decent majority of high-powered mining rigs. For instance, using today’s BTC exchange rates, the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro with 110 terahash per second (TH/s) will produce $16.81 per day if the machine’s electrical costs are around $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). SHA256 machines that produce at least 25 TH/s will still turn a profit using today’s BTC exchange rate and $0.12 per kWh.Over ten years ago, on October 18, 2011, the cost of a single bitcoin fell below the price to produce bitcoin (BTC). It wasn’t the only time this has happened, but it was one of the first times the price of bitcoin was said to be lower than the cost to mine the digital currency. That week in 2011, the network’s hashrate was around 8.596 TH/s or 8,596,000,000,000 hashes per second. While the hashrate was much less than today, it was still nine-hundred-six million percent (906,593,161.72%) higher in 2011 than on January 5, 2009.At the time, when BTC’s price fell below the cost of production, it made international headlines. The Guardian’s contributor ​​Charles Arthur wrote about the incident on October 18, 2011, when he explained how BTC’s price crashed from a high of over $30 per unit to $1-2 per BTC in mid-October. That year, Arthur called BTC a “‘Hackers’ virtual currency and favoured means of exchange.” The Guardian writer’s report said that BTC’s price “plummeted across exchanges – to a level where it costs more to ‘mine’ them than they are worth.”About a year after the 2013 price high, BTC’s value started to near dropping below the cost of production again. During the first week of December, the network hashrate declined and the CEO of Spondoolies-Tech, Guy Corem, explained how the crypto asset’s market value was affecting miners at the time. “Under the current bitcoin value, mining gear efficiency of 0.5–0.7 J/GH range and energy cost, we’ll reach equilibrium very soon,” Corem said. The cost to mine BTC was reportedly more than they were worth in mid-January 2015 after Corem made those statements. That month in 2015, the price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $200 mark.According to reports in mid-December 2018, BTC’s price was lower than production costs again. At that time in 2018, BTC was changing hands for $3,200 per unit. Furthermore, on March 12, 2020, often referred to as ‘Black Thursday,’ BTC’s price shuddered and tanked down to the mid-$3K range, making it unprofitable for a majority of the network’s mining participants. While BTC’s price is 38% lower than the all-time high, some believe that it is still near current mining costs. In mid-January of this year, the popular Twitter account dubbed ‘Venture Founder’ told his 14,600 social media followers that “current production cost is $34K.”Venture Founder also mentioned the crypto asset’s value crashing below the cost of production in December 2018 and March 2020. “The worst dumps bitcoin ever had were due to miners capitulation (Dec 2018, Mar 2020), when BTC fell below production costs, it is at risk for miner capitulation,” Venture Founder tweeted. “BTC was at risk for miner capitulation at $30K in May. The current production cost is $34K,” he added.Knowing exactly what the cost of production is, and what a bitcoin miner’s all-in sustaining cost is, would be extremely hard to estimate, but there have been many who believe there is a number. The aforementioned instances describing the times and price-points where people believed the price of BTC had fallen below the cost to mine the crypto asset are a perfect example of this belief.For example, while a miner leverages a 100 TH/s machine and gets a daily profit for that machine of around $16.81 per day with electricity costing $0.12 per kWh, another miner could pay $0.06 per kWh. Moreover, one study published in October 2020 claims that “the cost of bitcoin mining has never really increased.”What do you think about the reported instances where it’s been said that the price of bitcoin fell below the cost of production? What do you think about the estimated $34K current cost of production statement? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

They are creating a vast amount of wealth. They are creating a hedge for people against inflation, inflation is a growing concern across the country. They are creating entrepreneurs in all 50 states.”He added: “I’m also particularly proud that my home state, Texas, is becoming an oasis for the blockchain community, for bitcoin miners, for innovators and entrepreneurs in the crypto world.”However, he warned: “Unfortunately, the one thing that’s capable of screwing this all up is the United States Congress.” Cruz has also raised concerns that most Congress members do not understand what Bitcoin is but they are trying to regulate it anyway.Several U.S. lawmakers have disclosed that they own cryptocurrency, including the pro-bitcoin senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis. Recently, Senator Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania also said he has exposure to cryptocurrency in his portfolio. He believes that crypto is here to stay and diversified portfolios should have some.What do you think about Senator Ted Cruz buying the bitcoin dip? Let us know in the comments section below.

122,A Mining Rig That Boasts 440 TH/s? Miners Question the Legitimacy of New Bitcoin Mining Device,"Feb 5, 2022","The cryptocurrency community has been discussing a newly announced bitcoin miner called the Numiner NM440 that claims to produce speeds of up to 440 terahash per second (TH/s). Furthermore, a publicly-listed company called Sphere 3D has detailed that it purchased 60,000 Numiner NM440 mining rigs and aims to deploy 32 exahash per second (EH/s) of SHA256 hashpower. Furthermore, there’s been some disbelief among members of the crypto community on whether or not the hashrate speed claims are legitimate.**Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to reflect comments from the firm Cerebras Systems concerning the image Numiner uses. A number of crypto supporters have been talking about a new bitcoin (BTC) miner that claims to process speeds that are higher than any mining rig on the market today. Furthermore, the machine called the Numiner NM440 series, allegedly processes at higher hashrate speeds than Bitmain’s upcoming models. That’s because the Numiner NM440s reportedly produces 440 TH/s, in comparison to the Bitmain Antminer S19 XP (140 TH/s) and the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd. (198 TH/s).In addition to the newly announced mining rigs, a publicly-listed firm called Sphere 3D (Nasdaq: ANY) has announced it has purchased 60,000 Numiner NM440s. According to the press release, Sphere 3D will “receive 12 pre-production NM440s for final evaluation and testing to [be] completed on or before June 1, 2022.”Sphere 3D, the data management firm that is merging with bitcoin miner Gryphon Digital Mining in a SPAC transaction, has signed a deal with mining computer maker NuMiner Technologies to purchase 60,000 its high-end NM440 machines for $1.7 billion@Sphere3D— PANONY｜We are Hiring! (@PANONYGroup) February 4, 2022After a final evaluation, more batches will be shipped to Sphere 3D with the option to purchase an additional 26.4 EH/s of machines. The current deal of 60,000 NM440s cost Sphere 3D $1.7 billion, according to the company. Sphere 3D’s stocks saw a rise after the announcement, jumping 30% higher.We launched with ~$1.7B in sales to preferred customer @Sphere3D. With only 60,000 machines, @Sphere3D will be one of the largest bitcoin miners in the global bitcoin mining industry. Learn more: https://t.co/kLQpNqhHhQ— numinerglobal (@numinerglobal) February 4, 2022According to Numiner’s website, the firm says the flagship NM440 is “the world’s most powerful and environmentally friendly miner.” In addition to the massive 440 TH/s, the specifications claim a single NM440 gets an efficiency rating of 20.2 joules per terahash (J/TH). The web portal claims the machines give a 75% reduction in energy consumption and the firm further insists if “all bitcoin miners deployed the NM440, global bitcoin mining energy consumption in 2021 would drop from ~121 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity1 to ~30 TWh.”While the specifications are better than most machines on the market, people are wondering if the machines are legitimate and individuals are curious about the new company. Poolin’s Alejandro De La Torre tweeted about the new miner and said: “Never heard of these guys before.” Luxor Mining tweeted about the announcement as well and on Twitter it asked its followers if people thought it was legit.“Numiner came out of nowhere and announced a 444 TH/s miner with an efficiency of 20.2 J/TH,” Luxor Mining said. “These specs would make it an industry-leading ASIC. What do we think fam, is this thing legit?”Luxor Mining continued to be skeptical and further said: “Jokes aside regarding the Numiner NM440: When we saw Gryphon’s preorder yesterday, we were highly skeptical but gave the rig the benefit of the doubt due to Gryphon’s press release. That said, there are too many red flags for us to regard the NM440 as a legitimate product,” the mining operation added. Luxor Mining further remarked:The NM440’s reported specs are highly dubious, as are Numiner’s marketing materials. Further, there’s very little information on Numiner’s development and team. As such, we cannot attest to the validity of the product and would caution our followers against it at this time.The Chinese journalist known as Wu Blockchain discussed the Numiner project as well on February 3. “Numiner announced its new bitcoin mining machine NM440, uses TSMC chips and cooperates with Foxconn and Xilinx, the highest 440T in history and 20.2 J/T. Sphere 3D has committed to buy 60,000 NM440 for $1.7 [billion]. (The authenticity of the data is questionable),” Wu Blockchain said.The website does say that the Numiner models are being produced in coordination with TSMC, Foxconn and Xilinx. While many questioned the legitimacy of the project, others made jokes about the pictured unit’s Mountain Dew colors, aesthetics and features.#NuMiner claims their new #NM440 bitcoin mining rig delivers an insane hashrate up to 440 TH/s https://t.co/gveVAvxhjF.

The publication further covered Sphere 3D’s acquisition of 60,000 mining rigs from Numiner on Thursday. Gryphon tweeted on February 3, and said that the mining operation was “excited at the prospect of working with Numiner as our pending merger partner, Sphere 3D.” Interestingly, Sphere 3D hasn’t tweeted since February 14, 2019.In a message sent to Bitcoin.com News, the firm Cerebras Systems says that the image of the Numiner NM440 is a misappropriated image of the company’s Cerebras CS-2 product.“We are aware of a startup crypto mining company using a misappropriated, altered image of the Cerebras CS-2 product for their own business purposes,” a spokesperson from Cerebras told our newsdesk. “This image improperly passes off our CS-2 as their own product, as you can see by the Cerebras logo still visible at the bottom of the image. We are not working, or otherwise affiliated, with this company. We are taking steps to address the situation,” the company’s spokesperson added.What do you think about the Numiner NM440?

LEO/USD, rose to an intraday high of $5.48, following its low of $4.02 during yesterday’s session. Today’s news comes as LEO broke past its recent resistance level of £$3.88 earlier this week, before falling in Thursday’s red wave.The move came as the moving averages of 10-days (red) and 25-days (blue) had an upward crossover for the first time since December 29. In addition to this, the RSI now tracks at 81, which is deep in overbought territory, which may giveaway to profit takers over the weekend.Relatively speaking, there were not many bears on Friday, with only 2 of the top 99 cryptocurrencies marginally falling.However, if you scrolled down to the #100 listed cryptocurrency, markets were not so kind to yesterday’s biggest gainer, immutable X (IMX).IMX was down by over 22% today, following its 35% rise on Thursday, as traders likely chose to take profits, rather than maintain their positions.Earlier in today’s session, IMX/USD slipped back to support of $3.01, after trading at a high above $5.40 less than 24-hours ago.

125,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH up Nearly 10%, Crypto Markets Rally","Feb 4, 2022","Following two consecutive sessions of declines, cryptocurrencies rebounded on Friday, as markets prepared for the first non-farm payrolls of the year. ETH was up 8% as of writing, with the crypto market cap 4.4% higher.On the first Friday of each month, non-farm payrolls in the United States are released, and this typically sees an increase in market volatility, across all asset classes.The world’s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, which fell to an intraday low of $36,388.14 during yesterday’s session, was up nearly 5% today, potentially benefiting from this volatility.This came as BTC/USD hit an intraday high of $38,139.66 on Friday, as both traders and investors seem to have bought Thursday’s dip.As a result, the 14-day RSI held its support of 35, which initially appeared to be broken, and this indicator has now surged beyond resistance of 40, and tracks at 41.4.As described earlier this week, bitcoin looks as though it is consolidating after selloffs in December and January, with many still anticipating either a break from support or resistance, to trigger the next sizable price swing. Momentum for this swing is somewhat bullish, based on recent rallies. ETH was once again higher on Friday, with prices of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency moving closer towards the $3,000 level.ETH/USD is currently up around 8% in today’s session, after hitting an intraday high of $2,855.75 earlier. The move saw ethereum briefly rally beyond resistance of $2,844.00, before giving back some of these gains, likely as a result of profit takers closing their positions. Heading into the weekend, the 14-day RSI is trading above resistance of 44, and if there are more bulls added to this run, we could see multi-week highs for ETH.Will the crypto red wave reappear this weekend?

126,Microstrategy CEO on Mainstream Bitcoin Adoption: 'I See Evidence of a Lot More Institutional Adoption',"Feb 3, 2022","The Nasdaq-listed company Microstrategy sees “evidence of a lot more institutional adoption” of bitcoin. The firm cited various reasons including “The circumstances and the currency volatility” in Turkey, South America, and Africa — “all of these things have elevated institutional awareness of bitcoin.”
The Nasdaq-listed software company Microstrategy discussed the future outlook for bitcoin during the company’s Q1 earnings call Wednesday.“With regard to the outlook for bitcoin, I think that in the past 12 months, the asset class has evolved and matured,” Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor explained, elaborating:I see evidence of a lot more institutional adoption, greater adoption amongst macro and other hedge funds.“We’ve made great progress with corporations,” he continued. “There will be 24 publicly traded bitcoin miners by the end of the quarter, so lots of publicly traded companies in the Bitcoin space.”Saylor also predicted that there will be “more and more publicly traded companies holding bitcoin on their balance sheets, more and more public investors with bitcoin exposure, more banks rolling out bitcoin acquisition and trading and custody services, more regulatory awareness and more clarity as to how the entire crypto industry is going to evolve.”The pro-bitcoin executive proceeded to outline many developments that have raised bitcoin awareness. “Many of the macroeconomic developments have elevated the stature and the awareness of businesses and investors in the rest of the world to bitcoin,” Saylor said, noting:The circumstances and the currency volatility in Turkey, the currency volatility in South America, the currency volatility in Africa, all of these things have elevated institutional awareness of bitcoin.In addition, “the capital market volatility, the volatility of equities, the S&P index, the volatility of Nasdaq, of big tech stocks, all of these things have elevated mainstream investors’ awareness to bitcoin,” Saylor described.The Microstrategy CEO further detailed: “There’s a growing sentiment that we see across the mainstream that Bitcoin is here to stay. The crypto economy represents a great opportunity for the entire world. And politicians and investors and corporations are working diligently to come to terms on what this means and how they should adjust their practices.” Saylor concluded:We look forward to the next wave of institutional adoption that, I think, should be driven as people get more educated and more aware of what digital property is.This week, Microstrategy bought 660 more bitcoins, raising the company’s crypto holdings to about 125,051 BTC.Do you agree with Michael Saylor about the future outlook for bitcoin?

127,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: Ethereum Down 6%, Crypto Red Wave Returns","Feb 3, 2022","Bitcoin and ethereum saw recent losses extended on Thursday, as global cryptocurrency markets declined during today’s session. Solana was also in the red, trading nearly 15% lower today.Following Wednesday’s drop in prices, BTC/USD declined for the second consecutive session, trading 5.25% lower as of writing. This selloff saw prices hit an intraday low of $36,375.54, following a high of $38,437.68 during Wednesday’s market session.As a result, the move saw bitcoin prices move closer to support of $35,000, which is a point it hasn’t reached since January 27. In addition to this, the 14-day RSI once again dropped lower, this time falling below the mid-level floor of 35, creeping deeper into oversold territory in the process. The RSI currently tracks at 34, however if this week’s momentum continues to extend downward, we could see this indicator hit as low as 29. Bulls may need to reassess short-term positions as there seems to be a re-emergence of the red wave. Following a strong start to February, which saw ethereum move to an 11-day high this past Tuesday, prices have now moved back toward bear territory.ETH/USD initially broke out of the resistance level of $2,600 to start the week, however after two consecutive days of selling, it is once again back to trading at that level.Prices fell to an intraday low of $2,589.55 during today’s session, dropping by as much as 6% in the process, with the RSI now tracking at 38. As of writing, ETH/USD appears to be using the current price point as support, with the RSI level of 37 also acting as a floor.Will we see the selloff ease at these current levels?

128,"Coinbase Shares Declined 50% From All-Time High, Stock Follows Bitcoin’s Ups and Downs","Feb 3, 2022","Roughly nine months ago, Coinbase’s initial public offering (IPO) via a direct listing on Nasdaq launched, and shares swapped for $342 per share on April 16, 2021. Since then, Coinbase shares have dropped by close to half that value and today, COIN is swapping for more than 45% lower at $187 per unit.Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is a popular crypto firm and digital asset exchange with 8.8 million monthly transacting users during its height in Q2 2021. The business founded by Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong in 2012 officially went public on Nasdaq on April 14, 2021, via a direct listing. As the company heads into its tenth operational year, COIN shares have been trading for much less than the stock’s value on April 16 and November 12, 2021.When COIN first launched, the stock exchange Nasdaq decided on an initial $250 per share reference price. Two days later — and while bitcoin (BTC) reached $64K per unit — COIN tapped a high of $342 per share. The Coinbase stock dropped in value after that day, and dipped to a consolidated low of $242 during the months of May through September, with a few jumps to the $250-278 range during that time.The Nasdaq-traded stock follows alongside BTC’s fluctuations like many crypto-asset firms that have exposure to this new asset class. So when BTC ran up to another price high beyond $64K to an all-time high of $69K, COIN hit another $342 price high. The stock is now close to half the $342 price high, and is 45.16% lower in value, trading at $187 per share. Similar to BTC, the price is much lower than the ATH and in December COIN had a brief Holiday rally alongside the crypto economy’s passing comeback that month.In a recent blog post, the Boston-based data and analytics firm Trefis asked if the Coinbase stock was a good buy after such a sizeable correction. “The stock currently trades at just about 22x our projected 2021 earnings, which is not a particularly rich valuation for a highly profitable and futuristic stock with solid long-term earnings potential,” Trefis said on Wednesday. “For perspective, Coinbase’s net margins stood at an incredible 57% over the first three quarters of 2021.”The data and analytics firm added:However, the cryptocurrency market is inherently cyclical, and the odds are that we could be approaching a market peak given the Fed’s stance on interest rates. This could hurt momentum for Coinbase in the near term. That said, the stock could still be worth a look for long-term investors.What do you think about the current value of Coinbase’s stock and the sizeable correction shares have seen since its ATH?

129,Fidelity Discusses Future of Crypto Ecosystem — Says Bitcoin Is 'a Superior Form of Money',"Feb 2, 2022","Fidelity Digital Assets has released a report explaining why bitcoin is a superior form of money. The report discusses the future of the digital asset ecosystem and compares bitcoin to newer and smaller cryptocurrencies.Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, published a report this week titled “Bitcoin First: Why investors need to consider bitcoin separately from other digital assets.”The report addresses some concerns investors have including whether bitcoin “may be vulnerable to innovative destruction from competitors (such as the story of Myspace and Facebook)” or whether the cryptocurrency “offers the same potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital assets.”Report authors Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter explained:Traditional investors typically apply a technology investing framework to bitcoin, leading to the conclusion bitcoin as a first-mover technology will easily be supplanted by a superior one or have lower returns.They noted, “Bitcoin is currently the most secure and decentralized network but, at the base or native network layer, it is not the most scalable.” This has led to a boom in the digital asset ecosystem, they continued.The report proceeds to discuss two dominant narratives for envisioning the future of the digital asset ecosystem.The first is “a multi-chain world.” The authors described: “In a world of multiple winning chains, it still appears that Bitcoin is likely the best equipped to fulfill the role of the ecosystem’s non-sovereign monetary good with relatively less competition than other digital assets attempting to fulfill alternative use cases.”The second is “a winner-take-all or most world” narrative. The report details: “Given that Bitcoin is arguably the most decentralized and immutable blockchain in existence, it appears as a prime candidate to be one of, or perhaps even the sole winner if this situation were to play out.”After discussing various aspects of Bitcoin, including the Bitcoin network, “its enforceable scarcity,” the Lindy Effect, the blocksize war, the Lightning Network, and Ethereum, the authors wrote:Bitcoin’s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology but as a superior form of money. As a monetary good, bitcoin is unique.“Therefore, not only do we believe investors should consider bitcoin first in order to understand digital assets, but that bitcoin should be considered first and separate from all other digital assets that have come after it,” the Fidelity report concludes.Do you agree with Fidelity about Bitcoin?

130,El Salvador Switches Tech Providers — Chooses Alphapoint to Operate Chivo Bitcoin Wallet,"Feb 2, 2022","On February 2, 2022, the blockchain infrastructure provider Alphapoint has announced that the Salvadoran government has chosen the firm to operate the bitcoin wallet Chivo. The bitcoin wallet is the largest fintech application in the country and Alphapoint “supports the frontend and backend infrastructure that powers the wallet and integrates the entire ecosystem.”The Central American nation of El Salvador has announced it has appointed Alphapoint to handle the country’s bitcoin wallet, Chivo, by allowing it to support its frontend and backend technology. Prior to Alphapoint, the Chivo wallet’s infrastructure was provided by the crypto company Athena Bitcoin. On Wednesday, Alphapoint revealed the Salvadoran government had chosen the firm to help El Salvador “offer financial services and access to Bitcoin for millions of Salvadorans actively using the wallet.”“El Salvador and President Bukele are truly leading globally with this first major experiment in bitcoin adoption at a country-wide level,” Igor Telyatnikov, the co-founder and CEO of Alphapoint said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. Telyatnikov added:No one else has attempted to execute a project of this size. We at AlphaPoint are honored to be involved in the process and provide the scalable and reliable solutions needed for this massive undertaking. The Chivo application is currently supporting millions of Salvadorans, many for their first time accessing financial services.The Salvadoran government’s Chivo wallet has experienced hiccups when it launched and a significant amount of complaints. In mid-September 2021, the Salvadoran Court of Accounts said it planned to investigate Chivo’s kiosk construction. In addition to Alphapoint’s announcement on Wednesday, the Salvadoran government issued a statement about the transition.“The Government of President Nayib Bukele informs that the American company Alphapoint is providing technology for Chivo Wallet, the first national digital wallet in the world,” the statement from Bukele’s government explains. “Alphapoint, which provides financial technology to institutions globally, is adding its expertise to offer financial services and access to bitcoin for millions of Salvadorans who are actively using the Chivo wallet.”What do you think about the Salvadoran government choosing Alphapoint to run Chivo wallet’s underlying tech?

131,Bitcoin Mining Report Shows Network's Emissions Account for 0.08% of the World's CO2,"Feb 2, 2022","During the last year, Bitcoin — the cryptocurrency network that leverages proof-of-work (PoW) to process transactions and secure the protocol — has received a lot of criticism about its environmental impact. This week, the cryptocurrency firm Coinshares published a report that shows talking points condemning the network’s electrical consumption have been greatly exaggerated. According to Coinshares’ data, Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure accounts for 0.08% of the world’s carbon dioxide (CO2) production today.There’s been a lot of disapproval by people who wholeheartedly believe the Bitcoin network is bad for the environment. Many have condemned Bitcoin’s PoW because they believe it requires too much energy to keep the network running strong. Although, the critics never discuss the U.S. dollar’s energy consumption and how it is also enforced by state violence. Detractors also leverage data with extreme bias and inaccuracies stemming from the Digiconomist website. For example, the web portal is operated by Alex de Vries, an employee of De Nederlandsche Bank NV (DNB).Despite the fault-finding critics, numerous reports have shown that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is far less than alternative financial systems. In May 2021, Galaxy Digital published a study on the energy consumption of bitcoin mining, and it found it was far less than the energy the gold or banking industry consumes. Galaxy Digital also described how methane emissions are leveraged by companies like Great American Mining, Upstream Data, and Crusoe Energy Systems by turning wasted flare gas into consumable energy. Galaxy Digital’s study notes:Bitcoin mining is the ideal energy sink: anyone, anywhere, can monetize excess energy by plugging in equipment and switching it off at their convenience. One example of where Bitcoin mining acts as an energy sink is in oil fields, resulting in a direct reduction in methane emissions.This week Coinshares published its bitcoin mining report, a study that provides the most current data concerning the state of the bitcoin mining industry alongside environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. The Coinshares report estimates the Bitcoin protocol emitted 42 megatons of CO2 in 2021.The study highlights that the earth’s total emissions in 2019 amount to 49,360 megatons of CO2. In addition to the network’s mining infrastructure accounting for 0.08% of the world’s carbon dioxide, Bitcoin’s energy draw is also 0.05% of the total energy consumed globally. The Coinshares study says:As a point of reference, total global energy consumption (not production, which is considerably higher) in 2019 has been estimated at 162,194 TWh. At an annual energy draw of 89 TWh, the Bitcoin mining network uses approximately 0.05% of the total energy consumed globally. This strikes us as a small cost for a global monetary system, and on the global energy balance sheet, it amounts to a rounding error.Meanwhile, ESG concerns have caused numerous companies to drop bitcoin support or consider dropping bitcoin in the future. For instance, the software community Mozilla paused the ability to donate cryptocurrencies over “environmental impact” concerns. Tesla also dropped bitcoin acceptance because of its impact on the environment. Following Mozilla, the Wikimedia Foundation considered dropping crypto donations for the same reasons and Wikimedia members leveraged the Digiconomist’s inaccurate data that has been debunked on many occasions over bias and data discrepancies.The bitcoin mining report published by Coinshares this week shows that the ESG concerns over the last 12 months have been greatly exaggerated. Coinshares says that the current focus should be spent more on producing renewable energy resources, rather than attacking a monetary innovation that has an insignificant emission rate and energy draw.“While it is clear that there currently are emissions created as a result of bitcoin mining, these emissions are not only insignificant on a global scale, but they are in no way necessary in and of themselves,” the Coinshares report concludes. “Bitcoin will be 100% renewable as soon as our electricity generation is 100% renewable. Our focus should be on building out renewable power generation, not on stifling the development of monetary technology.”What do you think about the report published by Coinshares that shows the Bitcoin network’s emissions account for only around 0.08% of the world’s carbon dioxide production today? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Bitcoin and ethereum were both trading lower during today’s session. BTC/USD followed up yesterday’s rally with a weak showing on Wednesday, falling by as much as 1.13% as of writing.This decline saw prices hit an intraday low of $38,271.44, following a high of $39,115.13 during Tuesday’s market session, which raised hopes for those targeting $40,000.Today’s move saw BTC’s 14-day RSI once again drop below the resistance level of 40, which it had briefly broken yesterday, hitting its highest price strength since early January in the process. Recent consolidations in price have meant that the 10-day (red), and 15-day (blue) moving averages have moved closer in proximity, which isn’t a bad thing for bulls.Looking at the chart, the 10-day is now upward facing, which increases the chances of a potential crossover, and this could be the sign that longer term bulls have been waiting for.Despite this, we may see markets continue to consolidate prior to this cross.Ethereum was one of yesterday’s big gainers, breaking out of its resistance level in the process, however those gains have somewhat slowed on Wednesday. Following yesterday’s breakout, ETH/USD appears to have found a new resistance level of $2,800, which was the level where today’s decline began.Similar to BTC, this move coincided with the RSI level of 44 acting as a hard ceiling to further gains in strength, leading to prices falling to an intraday low of $2,745.26. As of writing, ETH/USD is trading marginally lower, falling by 0.41% on the day, with the possibility for a decline back to support of $2,600 also a possibility.What would need to happen for the recent strength in ETH to continue this week?

The country’s finance minister reportedly “angrily” said, “No international organization is going to make us do anything, anything at all.”
The government of El Salvador has rejected a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to drop bitcoin as legal tender in the country.The IMF urged El Salvador last week to drop bitcoin’s use as legal tender and dissolve Fidebitcoin, the $150 million trust fund created for the Bitcoin law.El Salvador’s Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya told a local television station that bitcoin is an issue of “sovereignty.” According to the media, he “angrily” said:No international organization is going to make us do anything, anything at all.“Countries are sovereign nations and they take sovereign decisions about public policy,” the finance minister added.According to its analysis, “In the near-term the actual costs of implementing Chivo and operationalizing the Bitcoin law exceed potential benefits,” the IMF stated in its recent report on El Salvador.The International Monetary Fund also recommended that El Salvador’s government start charging fees for the use of its digital wallet, Chivo. In addition, the IMF wants the Salvadoran government to stop giving away $30 in bitcoin to anyone signing up to use the Chivo wallet.According to the IMF’s recent report on El Salvador, the government did not see a need to scale back the scope of its Bitcoin law but agreed that regulation could be strengthened.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as a national currency with legal tender status alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year. Since then, the country has purchased 1,801 BTC for its treasury.In early January, El Salvador said 20 bills are being drafted for the legal structure of its bitcoin bonds which President Nayib Bukele expects to be oversubscribed. He also expects two more countries to adopt BTC as legal tender this year. Furthermore, he predicted “a gigantic price increase” for bitcoin.What do you think about El Salvador rejecting the IMF’s recommendation to drop bitcoin as legal tender?

As a result of this rally, prices have marginally broken out of the long-term descending triangle channel, with many now expecting an imminent rise to $40,000.Looking at the chart above, although the RSI has moved past the level of 40, there still appears to be significant resistance at current levels, which could potentially cause some bulls to tread carefully.Once a full break eventually takes place, BTC/USD may head to as high as $44,000.ETH was also higher to start the new month, and was one of the big movers within the top 10 ranked cryptocurrencies. Following a low of $2,556.16 on Monday, ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $2,788.90 during today’s session, which is a 10-day high.This move, which sees ETH trading nearly 10% higher, comes after it broke out of the $2,600 resistance level, which was in place since January 21st. Similar to BTC, ethereum is now close to a point of uncertainty within the 14-day RSI, and this will likely act as a short-term hurdle to further increases in price. If this resistance is broken, how high could ETH go? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

137,"US Lawmakers Press Bitcoin Mining Firms on Energy Usage, Carbon Emissions, Climate Crisis","Jan 31, 2022","Eight U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have sent letters to top U.S.-based bitcoin mining firms questioning them about their crypto mining operations. “The extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with bitcoin mining could undermine our hard work to tackle the climate crisis — not to mention the harmful impacts cryptomining has on local environments and electricity prices,” Senator Warren wrote.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, announced Thursday that she and seven other senators have sent letters to six crypto mining companies “raising concerns over their extraordinarily high energy usage.”The announcement details: “Senator Warren and her colleagues asked each company to detail their electricity consumption, scaling plans, agreements with electricity companies, and impact on energy costs for consumers and small businesses by February 10, 2022.”The letters were sent to six crypto mining firms: Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Holdings, Stronghold Digital Mining, Bitdeer, Bitfury Group, and Bit Digital.Senator Warren explained:The extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with bitcoin mining could undermine our hard work to tackle the climate crisis — not to mention the harmful impacts cryptomining has on local environments and electricity prices.She claims that “Bitcoin mining’s power consumption has more than tripled from 2019 to 2021, rivaling the energy consumption of Washington state, and of entire countries like Denmark, Chile, and Argentina.”“We need more information on the operations of these cryptomining companies to understand the full scope of the consequences for our environment and local communities,” the senator from Massachusetts stressed.In December last year, Senator Warren sent a similar letter to Greenidge Generation Holdings, which operates one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the U.S. She asked the company about their emissions and impacts on local ecosystems and electricity prices.A report on the bitcoin mining industry published by Coinshares this month notes that “Usage of energy is a contentious and much misunderstood function of the Bitcoin monetary system.” The report explains, “Carbon emissions emitted by electricity providers supplying the bitcoin mining network are inconsequential,” elaborating:At 0.08% of global CO2e emissions, removing the entire mining network from global demand — and thereby depriving hundreds of millions of people of their only hope for a fair and accessible form of money — would not amount to anything more than a rounding error.What do you think about Senator Elizabeth Warren sending letters to crypto mining firms?

138,Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele Expects Bitcoin to Experience a 'Gigantic Price Increase',"Jan 31, 2022","El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, believes that it’s just a matter of time before bitcoin sees a “gigantic price increase.” Bukele stressed on Twitter that bitcoin is extremely scarce and there’s not enough bitcoin in the world for all today’s millionaires.The Salvadoran bureaucrat, businessman, and the 43rd president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, is a big believer in the value of bitcoin (BTC). El Salvador and Bukele’s government are well known for codifying bitcoin as legal tender in June 2021. On September 7, 2021, the price of BTC dive-bombed, so Bukele decided to buy the dip and add it to El Salvador’s growing stash of bitcoins. Bukele and El Salvador have been purchasing BTC on a regular basis during another pandemic scare, and in the midst of even more bitcoin price dips.Bukele has said that when the price of BTC is down, it’s the best time to stock up on the scarce crypto asset. “Most people go in when the price is up,” Bukele recently tweeted. “But the safest and most profitable moment to buy is when the price is down. It’s not rocket science. So invest a piece of your McDonald’s paycheck in bitcoin,” the Salvadoran president added.https://t.co/s1F5kwOBEn pic.twitter.com/LD0I2dBHha— Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) January 26, 2022The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently “urged” the Salvadoran government to drop bitcoin as legal tender. Following the warning, the IMF then published a 114-page report on the subject of El Salvador adopting bitcoin, and said the costs exceed the benefits. Salvadoran president Bukele responded to the IMF with an animated GIF from an episode of “The Simpsons.” Bukele has also met with Turkey’s president Tayyip Erdoğan and the Salvadoran leader allegedly discussed the benefits of bitcoin.This week, Bukele has explained that bitcoin (BTC) is very scarce and he expects BTC’s price to see a giant leap in the future. Bukele tweeted:There are more than 50 million millionaires in the world. Imagine when each one of them decides they should own at least ONE bitcoin. But there will ever be only 21 million bitcoin. Not enough for even half of them. A gigantic price increase is just a matter of time.Of course, gold bug and economist Peter Schiff had to throw in his two cents about bitcoin and Bukele’s scarcity statement. “But why buy an entire bitcoin when a single [satoshi] will do the job just as well (which is nothing),” Schiff replied to Bukele’s tweet. “A bitcoin is merely an arbitrary bundle of one hundred million [satoshis]. It’s far more likely that millionaires who already own bitcoin will sell! A gigantic price collapse is coming,” Schiff responded, mocking Bukele.What do you think about El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption experiment and Nayib Bukele’s belief that it’s just a matter of time before bitcoin sees a gigantic price increase?

139,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC up 10% From Same Point Last Week","Jan 31, 2022","Despite trading lower on Monday, bitcoin is up over 10% from the same point last week, with ETH also gaining within that period. In general, crypto markets were weaker to start the new week.Following some strong rallies over the weekend, BTC/USD gave back some of these gains on Monday, falling to an intraday low of $36,733.57.This comes after the world’s largest cryptocurrency edged closer to the $40,000 level, by hitting $38,168.01 during Sunday’s session.The move saw its 14-day RSI climb to 38, however as on January 18th, price action was simply not strong enough to move past that point.As of now, bitcoin is tracking at 34 on this indicator, and has extended the consolidation between support of $35,470, and resistance of $39,010.Looking at the chart, you can see that the 10-day(red) moving average has begun to slow its downward trajectory, giving way for the potential upside swing. BTC/USD is currently down 2%, trading at $37,259.85, however prospects for a bullish breakout remain, whilst we continue to consolidate at current levels. Some expect that bull run to come this week.On Monday, ETH is up over 17% higher from its price at the same point last week, despite trading in the red to begin the day.ETH/USD fell to an intraday low of $2,489.07 during the session, despite hitting a 5-day high of $2,622.5 late on Sunday.The short-term resistance of $2,600 which has been in place since January 22nd, continues to be a hurdle to further upside swings.In addition to this, the RSI has not moved beyond 36 during that same period, and although prices are oversold, the lack in price strength has deterred bulls from taking longer-term positions.Could that change this week, with more bulls re-entering? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

140,Ark Invest Expects Bitcoin to Exceed $1 Million by 2030 — Says BTC Could Transform Monetary History,"Jan 30, 2022","Ark Investment Management (Ark Invest) has predicted that the price of bitcoin could surpass $1 million per coin by 2030. “Our research suggests that bitcoin has the potential to transform monetary history by providing financial freedom and empowerment in a fair, global, and distributed way,” Ark’s analyst added.
In Ark Invest’s “Big Ideas 2022” report published last week, the firm’s analyst Yassine Elmandjra explained that “As bitcoin’s market capitalization hit an all-time high in 2021, Ark’s research indicated that its network fundamentals remained healthy.”Noting that “Bitcoin’s market capitalization still represents a fraction of global assets and is likely to scale as nation-states adopt [it] as legal tender,” the analyst detailed:According to our estimates, the price of one bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030.El Salvador adopted BTC as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year. The Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, has predicted that bitcoin will be legal tender in two more countries this year. Devere Group’s CEO expects three countries to do so while Bitmex’s CEO said five countries will. Meanwhile, Fidelity said that it “wouldn’t be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.”The Ark report also cites network upgrades and growing adoption by institutions as some of the reasons for the price of the cryptocurrency to soar. In addition, the firm said that bitcoin mining will encourage and generate cleaner solutions. The analyst further wrote:Our research suggests that bitcoin has the potential to transform monetary history by providing financial freedom and empowerment in a fair, global, and distributed way.In addition, the Ark Invest report describes: “Public blockchains are powering novel forms of coordination across money, finance, and the internet. By decentralizing institutions with open-source software, blockchain technology minimizes the need to trust centralized authorities.” Ark’s analysts, including Elmandjra, concluded:We believe bitcoin is the most profound application of public blockchains, the foundation of ‘self-sovereign’ digital money.“The Bitcoin protocol has enabled two other revolutions: the financial (defi) and internet (Web3) revolutions,” they emphasized.Do you agree with Ark Invest’s bitcoin price prediction?

141,Goldman Sachs Warns Bitcoin Increasingly Vulnerable to Fed Rate Hikes as Mainstream Adoption Grows,"Jan 30, 2022","Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has warned that bitcoin is increasingly vulnerable to the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes as the cryptocurrency grows more widely adopted. “Over the last two years, as bitcoin has seen wider mainstream adoption, its correlation with macro assets has picked up,” the Goldman analysts explained.
Global investment bank Goldman Sachs published a research note Thursday detailing bitcoin’s increased vulnerability to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates.Zach Pandl, bank’s co-head of foreign exchange strategy, and FX analyst Isabella Rosenberg explained that as mainstream adoption of bitcoin increases, so does the cryptocurrency’s vulnerability to Fed policy. They described:Over the last two years, as bitcoin has seen wider mainstream adoption, its correlation with macro assets has picked up.Noting that higher bond yields have affected technology stocks in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq 100 index falling more than 13% for the year, the analysts noted: “Bitcoin and other digital assets have likely suffered from the same forces … These assets will not be immune to macroeconomic forces, including central bank monetary tightening.”The markets now expect the Fed to hike interest rates five times this year. Goldman Sachs believes that the Fed could raise interest rates at every meeting this year. The post-meeting statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last week did not provide a specific time for when the increase will come, though indications are that it could happen as soon as the March meeting.Goldman’s analysts further commented:Over time, further development of blockchain technology, including applications in the metaverse, may provide a secular tailwind to valuations for certain digital assets.Recently, Goldman Sachs said that the metaverse could be an $8 trillion opportunity. Rival investment bank Morgan Stanley similarly estimated a comparable size for the metaverse.Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs predicted that bitcoin could reach $100,000 as the cryptocurrency continues to take gold’s market share. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS, has warned of a crypto winter amid expectations of Fed rate hikes and regulation. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $37,502 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. The crypto is up 6.6% in the last seven days but down 20.5% in the past 30 days. However, it is still up 9.8% for the year.A recent report by Crypto.com shows that the number of global crypto owners is expected to surpass 1 billion this year.Do you agree with Goldman Sachs?

142,IMF Tells El Salvador: Costs of Making Bitcoin Legal Tender Exceed Potential Benefits,"Jan 30, 2022","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has told El Salvador that the costs of implementing the country’s Bitcoin law, which makes the cryptocurrency legal tender, exceed the potential benefits. The IMF has also urged El Salvador to dissolve the “Fidebitcoin” trust fund and start charging fees for services provided by the government’s Chivo digital wallet.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a 114-page report on El Salvador Friday with a dedicated section on bitcoin as legal tender and the government’s Chivo digital wallet “as a new means of payments.”El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as an official currency with legal tender status alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year. The IMF report notes that the Salvadoran government’s Chivo wallet, which can be used for dollars and BTC, has “amassed a sizeable number of clients, 3.8 million, although it is unclear how many are using bitcoin in their transactions or holding balances in bitcoin.”The report explains that under El Salvador’s Bitcoin law, “a trust fund, Fidebitcoin, endowed with US$150 million has been established to guarantee the conversion” between bitcoin and dollars. The funds have been primarily used to finance the launch of Chivo, the report states.According to the IMF:In the near-term, the actual costs of implementing Chivo and operationalizing the Bitcoin law exceed potential benefits.The IMF estimates that the short-term budgetary costs are 1% of GDP for 2021-2022 while near-term gains may measure up to ¼% of GDP per year.The report also outlines the risks of adopting bitcoin as legal tender, stating:By adopting bitcoin as legal tender considerable risks are introduced to financial stability, financial and market integrity, and consumer protection … If the use of bitcoin increases significantly, it can risk the dollarization regime that has proven to be [a] successful nominal anchor for the economy.To “address the risks from using bitcoin as legal tender,” the IMF recommends “narrowing the Bitcoin law’s scope, at the minimum by removing bitcoin’s legal tender status, and making explicit its strictly voluntary nature for all type of transactions.”The International Monetary Fund added that “Three other areas require prompt corrective measures.” Two of the areas are “Developing strict Chivo’s regulatory oversight” and “Safeguarding financial stability and adapting the banking regulatory frameworks.”The third area that needs immediate corrective measures is “Containing the budgetary costs.” For this, the IMF wrote:Staff recommends … making Chivo a self-funded company (charging fees for services provided). Staff also recommends ending US$30 subsidy to every new Chivo user and liquidating Fidebitcoin — returning unused funds to the Treasury.What do you think about the IMF’s recommendations for El Salvador?

143,"Russians Aware of Bitcoin Divided on Proposed Crypto Ban, Poll Finds","Jan 30, 2022","A new survey has indicated that Russians who have heard about cryptocurrency are deeply divided in their opinions on the recently suggested ban on operations with digital assets. A third of the respondents support the central bank’s proposal while an equal number of participants in the survey oppose it.Amid ongoing discussions on the future of digital currencies, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (Vtsiom) has published a new study measuring the attitudes of Russian citizens towards crypto assets and operations with them. It comes as officials are trying to put the country’s crypto space in order, not without disagreements between regulators.According to the poll, the majority of Russians (64%) have heard about bitcoin and 17% have good knowledge of the cryptocurrency, an increase of four percentage points in comparison with the data from a 2017 survey. The share of those who are totally unaware of its existence has shrunk by 11 points to just 19%.According to the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain (Racib), over 17 million Russians have cryptocurrency wallets. Russian citizens have invested 5 trillion rubles in crypto (over $67 billion), the head of the State Duma Financial Market Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, announced in December.The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies has forced Moscow to take steps to regulate the market. Citing threats to the nation’s financial stability and risks for its citizens, Bank of Russia proposed a blanket ban on a range of crypto activities including the issuing, using, trading, and mining of coins like bitcoin. The prohibition has been opposed by other institutions and the government has reportedly prepared a roadmap to regulate, not ban crypto operations.Equal numbers of crypto-aware Russians now support and reject the central bank’s idea (32% each), the survey conducted by Vtsiom has shown. A similarly sized group of people, 33%, remain indifferent towards the regulator’s attempt to ban crypto-related transactions. A majority of the young, 54% of those aged 18 – 24 and half of the 25 to 34-year-olds, disagree with the monetary authority. On the other end of the spectrum are those aged 60 and over, among whom only 15% are against the ban.Despite the annual volume of crypto transactions made by Russians reaching $5 billion, according to Bank of Russia’s own estimates, 81% of the respondents do not wish to acquire cryptocurrency against 16% who said they wanted to buy. Over half of the participants in the study (56%) still think bitcoin is a bad investment while one in five questioned (22%) view it as a good option.The majority of Russians familiar with bitcoin admitted that neither they nor those they are close to had ever bought cryptocurrency (74%). A fifth of the polled revealed their relatives or friends had bought bitcoin (21%) and 4% purchased cryptos themselves. At the same time, more Russians (38%) believe a crypto stash is harder to steal, while those who feel fiat holdings are safer came out to 27%.What do you think about the findings in the survey and the proposals to regulate the Russian crypto sector?

Crypto markets were trading close to 5% higher on Saturday.The world’s largest cryptocurrency regained some upward momentum on Saturday, as bitcoin bulls appeared to have re-entered the race.BTC/USD rose to an intraday high of $37,952.88 on Saturday, following a low of $36,211.11 earlier in the session.Today’s rally comes as bitcoin appears to have broken above the key RSI level of 30, and now tracks north of 35 on the indicator. Despite remaining oversold, the breakout invigorated traders who were hoping to take BTC/USD to the $40,000 resistance level.Overall and long-term, the BTC/USD chart is still positioned within a descending triangle. However, the recent shorter-term ascending run has created a slight bottleneck in price.This, along with the potential for the RSI to rise to its next resistance point 41, may be enough to send price to, and potentially above, $40,000.Bulls could attempt to reach this point throughout the course of the weekend.ETH was trading over 8% higher during today’s session, hitting its recent resistance level of $2,570 in the process.Saturday’s rally saw ETH/USD climb to an intraday high of $2,576.46, which is its highest point since Thursday. Looking at the chart below, the moving averages of 10-days (red), and 25-days (blue), were still declining, however as the RSI tracks higher, many will begin to anticipate a potential cross. If this occurs, some may begin to target a range of $2,800 – $3,000. Has the bear run in ETH cooled off for now? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

145,JPMorgan Lowers Its Bitcoin Fair Price Estimate to $38K Amidst Volatility,"Jan 29, 2022","Leading investment bank JPMorgan has changed its view on the estimate of bitcoin’s price on a long-term basis. The institution had estimated a long-term price of $146K back in November when bitcoin was over $60K. One of the most important reasons for this change has to do with the increased volatility the asset has faced in recent times.JPMorgan, one of the biggest financial institutions in the world, has drastically changed its opinion on the price that bitcoin will reach long term. While JPMorgan was bullish last year, when it estimated this number at almost $150K, it has lowered its estimations due to the situation the market is experiencing this year.The new $38K price, about one-fourth of the previously calculated number, was estimated in a different context concerning gold and bitcoin and the volatility of the market. On this, JPMorgan stated in a note:Our previous projection that the bitcoin to gold volatility ratio will fall to around 2x later this year seems unrealistic. Our fair value for bitcoin based on a volatility ratio of bitcoin to gold of around 4x would be 1/4th of $150,000, or $38,000.Another factor that JPMorgan examined is the volatility bitcoin and the crypto market at large have been experiencing. This, according to the bank, makes it difficult for institutions to put their bets on bitcoin for reasons other than being a speculative asset.The note concluded:The biggest challenge for bitcoin going forward is its volatility and the boom and bust cycles that hinder further institutional adoption.The recent slump in cryptocurrency prices was attributed to several factors, and some considered the recent announcements by the Federal Reserve would affect the crypto markets, which have exhibited a correlation with other markets like the S&P500. One of these people was Arthur Hayes, who in a recent digest called “Circo Loco,” recommended a “wait and see” approach for investors wanting to get into the cryptocurrency market.Also, a report from Huobi titled “Taper Landed” issued in December, explained that the upcoming tapering would affect the growth of the cryptocurrency market. JPMorgan believes the market could go down even further, as it also found no signs of capitulation in the recent market movements.What do you think about the lowered expectations for bitcoin by JPMorgan? Tell us in the comments section below.

146,Belgian MP to Receive Entire Salary in Bitcoin — Says Crypto Adoption Will Be 'Exponential',"Jan 28, 2022","A member of the Brussels Parliament, Christophe De Beukelaer, says he will receive his entire salary in bitcoin this year. He believes that the technology will disrupt all industries and crypto adoption is going to be “exponential.”
Christophe De Beukelaer, a member of the Brussels Parliament, said in a blog post on his personal website that he will receive his 2022 salary in bitcoin.The lawmaker explained that “with the blockchain, we are at the dawn of a revolution of the same order as what we experienced with the internet 30 years ago.” He believes that all sectors “will be disrupted,” adding that in other countries, “large institutions are beginning to invest massively in crypto assets in order not to miss this gigantic opportunity.”Noting that “it is the role of politicians to make the population aware of these societal changes that are coming,” he stressed:We can no longer remain ignorant of this new world. It’s a bit like clinging to the carriage or the candle as cars and light bulbs appear. Adoption is going to be exponential.To generate interest around bitcoin and the crypto industry, the lawmaker has “decided to convert his entire salary for the whole of 2022 into bitcoin,” the post details.The lawmaker opined:I am the first in Europe, but not in the world, to want to shine the spotlight on cryptocurrencies with such an approach.He proceeded to reference the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who is receiving his first three paychecks in cryptocurrency. His first paycheck was recently converted into bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) via Coinbase. Mayor Adams said he converted his paycheck into bitcoin to send a message that New York City is open to technology.“I think it’s not too late for Brussels and Belgium to be at the forefront of the cryptocurrency industry. We already have some great companies in the field … but it’s time to position ourselves clearly and create a real ecosystem,” De Beukelaer concluded.What do you think about the lawmaker planning to receive his entire salary in bitcoin? And, do you agree with him that crypto adoption is going to be exponential? Let us know in the comments section below.

147,Finder's Experts Predict Bitcoin Will Peak at $94K This Year,"Jan 28, 2022","Finder’s panel of 33 fintech specialists has forecasted that the price of bitcoin will peak at about $94K before ending the year above $76K. In addition, the panel expects the price of the cryptocurrency to reach $192,800 in 2025 and $406,400 in 2030.
Finder, a major product comparison website, published an updated bitcoin price prediction Wednesday for 2022 by “Finder’s panel of 33 fintech specialists.”According to the panel’s BTC price forecasts:Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to peak at US$93,717 this year before dropping to $76,360 by the end of 2022 … This is roughly 60% higher than the price of bitcoin at the beginning of 2022.The panel of specialists also predicted the price of bitcoin for 2025 and 2030. However, their most recent predictions are lower than their October forecasts. At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is $36,311.13 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.By the end of 2025, the panel believes that the price of bitcoin will reach $192,800, which is 7% lower than their October forecast.As for the end of 2030, the panel expects the price of bitcoin to reach $406,400, which is 28% lower than their October forecast.Finder explained:Potential interest rate hikes might be what’s leading the panel to be more conservative with their predictions compared to back in October.While the Fed did not raise interest rates at its most recent meeting, the market expects the central bank to raise interest rates several times this year. Investment bank JPMorgan, for example, expects four rate hikes this year.While several panelists said that “increasing interest rates will negatively impact the cryptocurrency market,” some believe that it is time to buy BTC, including Finder’s founder, Fred Schebesta.He said:Cryptocurrencies are proving to be a staple competitor to the traditional financial infrastructure of the world, and many projects are now well beyond the theoretical realm of potential value and into reliable delivery.“One powerfully unique aspect of the cryptocurrency landscape is that there are now a number of decentralized finance (defi) platforms that provide access to highly competitive funding, and these offerings are showing zero signs of slowing down,” he further opined.Schebesta personally expects bitcoin’s price to surge to about $105K by the end of the year, he recently told Daily Mail Australia.What do you think about the predictions by Finder’s experts?

The day trader has had his ups and downs with bitcoin over the last few years, and it seems he’s now jumping back into the market.In August 2020, the stock trader and the founder of Barstool Sports blog, Dave Portnoy, told his Twitter followers that he currently owned “zero bitcoins.” “I will wait and watch,” the day trader wrote at the time. “I lost 25K. Just like with the stock market it took my brain time to figure it out. I know this. The Link Marines are weak and the orchid flowers do die in the crypto world. I may or may not be done,” Portnoy added. Earlier in the day, Portnoy seemed very irritated with cryptocurrency markets and stressed in a video:This Bitcoin — I don’t trust this market at all. I may be out of it by the end of today, and never come back.The Barstool Sports blog founder had recently entered into a BTC position when he sold his stash of dogecoin (DOGE), after hearing that Tesla sold some bitcoins in April 2021. “I am the proud owner of 1 bitcoin,” Portnoy said at the time. Now it seems after bitcoin (BTC) dropped over 40% from its November 10, 2021, all-time high, BTC is at the right price for Portnoy’s taste. The Barstool Sports blog founder tweeted:F***ed around and bought 29 bitcoins today.The CEO of Microstrategy Michael Saylor responded to Portnoy’s tweet and said: “Welcome to Team Bitcoin.” The purchase was featured on Barstool Sports blog in a post called “Davey Crypto Just Bought A Million Bucks Of Bitcoin,” written by the blogger Nate. “I thought that was the last we’d see of Parabolic Dave,” Nate wrote. “And then today he reached between his couch cushions and bought 29 [bitcoin]. A coooooool milly. All it took was a little old school Barstool mudslinging from the mean girls and a side order of Smitty and Dave is back in action. I love it.”The Barstool Sports blog founder’s tweet about purchasing 29 BTC for a million dollars was very popular on Twitter getting more than 32,000 likes and over 2,000 retweets, at the time of writing. Many bitcoin supporters welcomed Portnoy back into the fold and supported his decision to spend a million dollars on the leading crypto asset.What do you think about Dave Portnoy messing around and purchasing 29 bitcoin for a million dollars?

149,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Down 14% This Week","Jan 28, 2022","Following a volatile week of trading, the uncertainty in cryptocurrency markets continued on Friday. Overall, the global crypto market cap was almost 2% lower during the session. Thursday’s volatility extended into today’s session, with bitcoin prices continuing to consolidate near its recent support level of $35,600.00.BTC/USD fell to an intraday low of $35,629.28 on Friday, following a high of $37,423.99 earlier in the session.The move comes as bitcoin appears to be trading within a range of support ($35,600.00) and resistance ($38,510.00), in other words consolidating, after recent swings in price. Typically, when we see a trending market, bullish or bearish, prices begin to move with uncertainty when early entrants exit, and take profits, whilst later entrants look to capitalize on the recent trend, by longing or shorting.When this happens, prices tend to trade sideways, as markets have no clear direction, which seems to be the case with BTC this week. Friday’s chart shows that the RSI has slightly crept over 30, and is tracking at 32, however bulls still appear hesitant to re-enter the market.It’s possible they could make their move over this weekend. ETH was trading over 14% lower in the last seven days, and was down over 3% as of writing, hitting an intraday low of $2,328.45 in the process. Friday’s decline sees ETH/USD fall for a second consecutive session, as it continues to trade around support of $2,400.Looking at the chart below, price action is still weak, or oversold, and is tracking at 26 on the 14-day RSI, whilst short-term momentum continues to hint at further weakness.Although the moving averages of 10/25 days look to have exhausted the bearish sentiment on the daily chart, prices do not look like they are ready for an immediate rebound.Could this streak of consolidation be here for some time to come?

150,"Ministries Queried About Missing 200,000 Bitcoins as Bulgaria Explores Crypto Payments","Jan 28, 2022","The recently elected government of Bulgaria has found itself in the position of answering questions about the fate of billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency reportedly confiscated by the country’s law enforcement five years ago. Meanwhile, the new finance minister has revealed that authorities in Sofia are now exploring options to implement a crypto payment mechanism.The mystery surrounding the 213,576 bitcoins believed to have been seized by Bulgaria has entertained the global crypto community for years and raised questions in the Southeast European nation. Club Z, a local news and analysis outlet, and a member of the parliament, have recently asked three Bulgarian ministries to account for the country’s missing crypto fortune.In May 2017, the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) announced that Bulgarian authorities had captured the staggering amount of cryptocurrency in bitcoin wallets owned by suspects targeted in a joint cybercrime investigation in several countries on the Balkans. The operation codenamed “Pratka/Virus” dismantled a scheme to compromise the customs’ computer systems for tax evasion purposes.The information about the confiscated crypto funds was later denied by the head of the Specialized Prosecutor’s Office, Ivan Geshev, now serving as Bulgaria’s Prosecutor General, who attributed the false claim to SELEC. His statement was also supported by Ivailo Spiridonov, then director of the country’s organized crime combating agency, GDBOP.In mid-January this year, local media reported that U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken had listed Bulgaria as the nation with the largest cryptocurrency holding in its “2021’s Crypto-in-Review: Going Mainstream” report. However, the country is not featured in the ranking published with the current version of the document on Kraken’s website. While the press release from SELEC mentions a price of $2,354 per BTC, Bulgaria’s bitcoin, if it exists, should now be worth around $7.7 billion in today’s prices.This week, Club Z reported it had asked the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior for details on the case. The publication has so far received a response only from the finance ministry, which stated that it “has no information on bitcoins confiscated in favor of the state.”The department added that Finance Minister Asen Vasilev had ordered the National Revenue Agency and the National Customs Agency to conduct checks. In correspondence received by the department last August, a deputy prosecutor general confirmed that the Specialized Prosecutor’s Office had not seized and did not keep the said amount of cryptocurrency.Vasilev, who was a caretaker minister at the time, is now the minister of finance in Bulgaria’s new coalition government led by the “We Continue the Change” party he co-founded. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, where he said the EU member state intends to join the eurozone on Jan. 1, 2024, Vasilev revealed the executive power in Sofia is also exploring options to facilitate cryptocurrency payments.A crypto payment mechanism may be introduced “in the short to medium term,” the government official added. Vasilev, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, noted that the cabinet is now discussing the matter with the Bulgarian National Bank and crypto industry players. At the same time, he ruled out the possibility of Bulgaria becoming a crypto mining hub.Another request to shed light on the fate of the country’s alleged bitcoin stash has been made by Ivaylo Mirchev, a lawmaker from the “Democratic Bulgaria” coalition which is also part of the ruling majority. Mirchev has asked the Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov a number of questions including about the exact amount of seized bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. He wants to know how they are stored and whether Bulgarian authorities have access to the wallets. The deputy also seeks answers from the Ministry of Electronic Government.Do you think authorities in Sofia will be able to unravel the mystery of Bulgaria’s missing bitcoins? Tell us in the comments section below.

151,"Global Chip Shortage Looms Over Bitcoin Mining Industry, ASIC Supply Tightens","Jan 28, 2022","While Bitcoin’s hashrate has been coasting along above 175 exahash per second (EH/s) and recently reached an all-time high, a global shortage of semiconductor chips could slow the growing industry. The shortfall of supply worldwide has disrupted major industries, and manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) have seen stocks sink in value. At the same time, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturers are dependent on these chips.During the last 12 months, bitcoin mining operations have been securing million-dollar deals so they can pre-order thousands of ASIC bitcoin mining rigs. ASIC manufacturers such as Microbt, Bitmain, and Canaan have been selling batches of new models by the thousands to operators running data facilities.Meanwhile, the semiconductors ASIC bitcoin mining rigs leverage are extremely hard to obtain as hundreds of industries worldwide are suffering from a global chip shortage. According to a U.S. Department of Commerce survey of 150 companies, the firms only had five days of supply left when usually they have 40 days of supply on hand.“With sky-rocketing demand and full utilization of existing manufacturing facilities, it’s clear the only solution to solve this crisis in the long-term is to rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities,” Gina Raimondo, the U.S. secretary of commerce, said on Wednesday in a press release. The same day, reports showed that China plans to establish a Shenzhen sourcing strategy for semiconductors.China’s issues with the U.S. and the semiconductor shortage have reportedly led to the America Competes Act of 2022. The controversial bill’s proponents, like the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, claim the bill could help ease supply chain woes and the semiconductor shortage by strengthening American competitiveness.The Biden administration agrees and the U.S. president said the proposals will “help bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, and they’re squarely focused on easing the sort of supply chain bottlenecks like semiconductors that have led to higher prices for the middle class.”Meanwhile, the ASIC bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Bitmain announced the launch of two new bitcoin mining machines in the last three months. In mid-November, Bitmain revealed the Antminer S19 XP and on January 17, 2022, the company announced the launch of the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd.Moreover, it was said that five companies had exclusive access to the S19 XP pre-orders and firms like Greenidge Generation Holdings and Bitnile were two participants. Neither of the Bitmain-manufactured machines are due to ship until May and July 2022.Two of the largest ASIC bitcoin mining rig suppliers, Bitmain and Microbt, are sold out of most of their latest models. At the time of writing, Bitmain has Antminer S19j Pro (104 TH/s) machines available for spot orders at $11,024 per machine with a maximum purchase limit of 50 units per user. The company promises units will ship in five working days after they are fully paid.Canaan’s website details the customer must inquire with a representative in order to find out about available stock. The ASIC manufacturer Innosilicon’s supply is currently sold out, according to the website’s miner shopping section. This leads interested customers to deal with the ASIC bitcoin mining device secondary markets where mining rigs can be more expensive and the supply is not as good as it is with direct batches from the producers.Currently, the semiconductor crunch has not affected miners a great deal and past scares and chip supply shortages have been happening since 2020. This week the shortage has caused semiconductor company shares to fall as a few manufacturers like TSMC, Qualcomm, and Micron saw stocks drop in value.What do you think about the semiconductor chip shortage? Do you think it could affect the supply of ASIC bitcoin miners in the future? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

152,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: BTC Prices Shaken as Fed Keeps Rates Unchanged","Jan 27, 2022","Cryptocurrency markets were volatile on Thursday as traders appeared to react to the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Bitcoin and ethereum both saw price uncertainty, as markets now expect a March hike.After making a run towards the $40,000 resistance on Wednesday, trading above $38,000 in the process, BTC/USD fell to a low of $35,690.05 earlier in today’s session .Thursday’s move comes as market uncertainty within crypto increased, resulting in today’s candlestick forming a doji, which typically means prices are neither bullish nor bearish. Following this uncertainty, market strength now hovers at the 30 RSI level, which means we are still within oversold territory. This RSI level appears to be a point of resistance, which may be the cause of today’s inaction in prices, resulting in traders waiting to see if a breakout could be on the cards.Overall, short-term momentum continues to point upward, as can be seen with the current ascending triangle, which is keeping hopes of a $40,000 resistance target alive.Many will now wait to see if this momentum continues on Friday, into the upcoming weekend.ETH was trading nearly 5% lower from yesterday’s high, however prices seemed to be consolidating, opposed to selling off. Following a high of $2,705.78 on Wednesday, which saw ETH/USD briefly break into the 0.236 Fibonacci resistance level, prices today fell to a low of $2,366.13.This drop in price saw markets hit what appeared to be a short-term support point of $2.390, which is an area where ETH has mostly traded this week.Looking at its current RSI trend, similarities can also be drawn with BTC, with both tracking at or below 30.Is this the key indicator traders are currently looking at before taking on new positions?

The man took money from customers but did not provide them with the agreed-upon bitcoin.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced last week that Michael Yusko has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison “for defrauding customers through unlicensed bitcoin business.”The 47-year-old resident of New Orleans sold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to customers in May 2018. “Yusko would promise customers any amount of bitcoin in exchange for U.S. dollars at five percent above market price for a five percent fee,” the DOJ detailed, emphasizing that he failed to follow through on transactions.According to the Justice Department, customers subsequently complained about their bitcoin purchases, stating:Yusko had defrauded them by not providing them with the agreed-upon bitcoin after taking their money.In addition, the New Orleans resident did not register his company as a money transmitting business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the Department of Treasury, the DOJ added, elaborating:Yusko also instructed his clients not to tell any bank employees that the purpose of their wire transfer was to purchase cryptocurrency.Noting that the bitcoin seller had pleaded guilty in this case pursuant to a plea agreement and “admitted to being responsible for $201,399.00 in losses to victims,” the DOJ concluded:Judge Ashe sentenced Yusko to one year and one day of prison, as well as three years of supervised release and a $100 mandatory special assessment fee. As part of his sentence, Yusko was ordered to make full restitution to victims in the amount of $411,009.00.Do you think this bitcoin seller should go to jail for one year?

154,Tesla's Latest Financial Statement Shows Bitcoin Worth $1.26 Billion,"Jan 26, 2022","Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, did not sell any bitcoin in the fourth quarter, according to the company’s latest financial statement. Tesla is holding bitcoin worth $1.26 billion. The company still has not resumed accepting bitcoin payments but now accepts the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise.
Tesla released its Q4 and FY2021 financial statements Wednesday. The company’s unaudited balance sheet shows net digital assets of $1.26 billion at the end of December last year. This amount is unchanged from the third quarter.Tesla’s unaudited statement of cash flows also shows that there was no purchase or sale of digital assets in the last three quarters. The only cryptocurrency purchase Tesla made was bitcoin in the first quarter in the amount of $1.5 billion. The only sale the company made was also in the first quarter.While Tesla never disclosed how much bitcoin it owns, Musk previously hinted that it is close to 42K BTC.The electric car company started accepting bitcoin for payments in March 2021. However, the company halted accepting the crypto in May citing environmental issues.Musk subsequently said that Tesla will resume accepting BTC when bitcoin miners can confirm clean energy usage. “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,” he said. However, Tesla still has not resumed accepting bitcoin.Meanwhile, Tesla is now accepting the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise. Musk, also known in the crypto community as the Dogefather, has been a longtime supporter of dogecoin. He recently tried to tempt McDonald’s to accept DOGE by offering to eat a happy meal on television if the fast-food chain accepts the meme coin. However, McDonald’s replied to Musk that it will only accept DOGE if Tesla accepts “grimacecoin.”What do you think about Tesla holding bitcoin but accepting dogecoin for payments?

155,Valkyrie Files for ETF That Invests in Firms That Derive 50% Revenue From Bitcoin Mining Industry,"Jan 26, 2022","The digital currency asset manager Valkyrie has applied for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund plans invest at least 80% of its net assets into firms that derive at least 50% of their revenue from the bitcoin mining industry.The crypto asset manager Valkyrie has applied for a new crypto-focused ETF that focuses on the bitcoin mining sector. Valkyrie is well known for launching the second bitcoin futures ETF under the ticker “BTF,” after Proshares launched the first bitcoin futures ETF called “BITO.”According to a filing with the U.S. SEC on January 26, 2022, Valkyrie is proposing to launch a fund that leverages firms that derive revenue from the bitcoin mining industry. The company wants to list the ETF on Nasdaq, the same market the bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund BTF trades on today.“The fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund that will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from bitcoin mining operations and/or from providing specialized chips, hardware, and software or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining,” Valkyrie’s filing explains.Cryptocurrency mining has been very profitable over the last 12 months and today, Bitcoin’s hashrate is hovering just above 180 exahash per second (EH/s). Using current BTC exchange rates, the best performing bitcoin miners with 100 terahash per second (TH/s) or more are getting $14 per day with $0.12 per kWh in electricity costs.Valkyrie’s recent application proposal Form N-1A, also explains the risks involved with bitcoin investments. The application notes that the fund will be “indirectly exposed to the risks of investing in bitcoin” and that bitcoin is a “new and highly speculative investment.”Meanwhile, Valkyrie’s BTF climbed 3.41% during the last 24 hours and is trading for $14.87 per share at the time of writing. 30-day statistics indicate BTF shed 25.69% after falling from $20.01 per share a month ago.Five-day metrics show BTF has lost 10.10% after rebounding a few percentages during the course of Wednesday’s trading sessions. Valkyrie’s BTF, Proshares’ BITO, and the Vaneck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) have all been following BTC’s market direction closely.Other types of funds and publicly-listed companies that have exposure to BTC are also following bitcoin’s price patterns.What do you think about Valkyrie’s recent ETF filing with the SEC for a bitcoin mining-focused fund?

156,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Nears 10% Gain, BTC Inches Toward $40,000","Jan 26, 2022","Days after falling to a 6-month low, bitcoin rose for a second consecutive session, as prices slowly approached its key level of $40,000. Today’s gain in BTC comes as the global crypto market cap was 4.7% higher from yesterday’s session, as of writing.The world’s largest cryptocurrency hit an intraday high of $38,415.90 on Wednesday, which is its highest level in the last six sessions. Today’s move comes as the 14-day RSI on BTC/USD broke out of its recent resistance level of 30, which typically signifies prices being oversold, and is now tracking at 38.Despite remaining relatively oversold, this short-term bullish momentum has led to the 10-day (red) EMA slowly curving out, with the potential for an upward cross with the 25-day (blue) EMA gradually increasing. If this were to occur, history shows that there could be increased buying pressure, as prices would likely break above the $40,000 ceiling. Which is an area where previous bull runs have started. However, as we approach this level, there looks to be some resistance ahead, with the RSI indicator showing that a ceiling of 41 could pour cold water on the current streak. This, if the recent bullish pressure isn’t enough to overcome the upcoming hurdle.ETH prices were trading close to 10% higher during the course of Wednesday’s session, hitting an intraday high of $2,648.49 in the process.Similar to bitcoin, ETH/USD moved past recent lows in its 14-day RSI, and currently tracks slightly above the 34 level.This gain in strength has led to prices hitting a 5-day high, now on the periphery of breaking into the 0.236 Fibonacci level.As you can see from the chart below, this fib level, which is at $2,675.00, has birthed several bull runs in the past.With no clear signs of resistance in volumes, are we set to see more gains in the price of ETH?

This month Bukele explained El Salvador was making investments in order to bolster the country’s geothermal energy production.The president of El Salvador has been buying bitcoin and adding it to the country’s treasury, according to his announcements on Twitter. The president of El Salvador said the country purchased 410 bitcoin last week, and the country has a total stash of ​​1,801 bitcoins.In addition to the IMF’s statements about the bitcoin tender law and bitcoin-backed bonds, the global financial institution criticized the Chivo e-wallet.“Directors agreed on the importance of boosting financial inclusion and noted that digital means of payment—such as the Chivo e-wallet—could play this role,” the IMF report concludes. “However, they emphasized the need for strict regulation and oversight of the new ecosystem of Chivo and Bitcoin.”What do you think about the IMF’s opinion that El Salvador should drop its bitcoin tender law?

Overall the global crypto market cap was over 6% higher from yesterday’s session.Bitcoin, which fell to an intraday low of $33,184.06 during yesterday’s session, was up close to 9% as of writing, hitting a high of $37,247.52 in the process.After a false breakout from its support level of $34,170 to start the week, today’s move saw BTC/USD climb from this point, with some anticipating the potential for a rally towards resistance of $40,000.Looking at the chart below, BTC bulls appear to have re-entered as many expected at this level, similar to July’s move, however with the RSI still oversold, many remain skeptical of a full scale bull run. Now that the short-term 10-day EMA (red) has somewhat eased its downward momentum, traders will be anticipating a potential reversal, as the chances of the upward cross gradually increase. One thing to consider is whether we are seeing long-term bitcoiners buying the dip.In the last seven days ETH has fallen over 20% in value, however Tuesday saw a slight easing of this bearish pressure, as bulls re-entered the race.As of writing, ETH/USD rose to an intraday high of $2,463.59, after almost falling below $2,000 on Monday, recording its lowest rate since July as a result.Looking at today’s chart, it appears to show that ETH has found an interim floor, despite the long-term descending triangle hinting at further downside pressure. Similar to BTC, Ethereum price action is still oversold, however as it gradually moves towards the 30 RSI level, the question is if we will see bullish sentiment begin to increase.What are your thoughts on the current market conditions?

Ethereum was also trading in the red, hitting multi-month lows in the process. This comes as the overall global market cap in cryptos was down close to 9% at the time of writing.Bitcoin (BTC), which has been the main focus of the recent decline in crypto prices, was trading 3% lower on Monday (at the time of writing), and almost 20% down from its position at the same time last week. As of writing, BTC/USD hit an intraday low of $33,184.06 during today’s session, which is its lowest level since July 23rd last year. Today’s move comes as prices broke below the recent support level of $40,135 last Thursday and extended throughout the weekend.Looking at the chart below, BTC appears to have found a new floor, reaching $34,200 on a daily chart. Although prices have moved beyond this interim support, some bulls argue that this could be a false breakout, pointing to the rally at the end of July as evidence for a potential reversal at this price range. The RSI also shows that price strength is below 30 (currently tracking at 22), which typically signifies a market being oversold. However, with the real bullish momentum appearing to come in above 30, we may be in for some further consolidation today.Ethereum (ETH) was down more than bitcoin to start the week, as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency was trading over 8% lower during the session. ETH/USD fell to $2,172.30 on Monday, its lowest level since July 27th. Similar to BTC, the chart below suggests that prices are oversold, however, the 10-day EMA also shows that there could be yet more bearish momentum, with a descending triangle highlighting a potential continuation of the current trend.Ethereum bulls will likely be watching the 0.236% Fibonacci level as a potential target for the next significant rally in prices.

The Latam-based unicorn announced on January 20th it had acquired shares of 2TM, the parent company of Mercado Bitcoin, one of the leading exchanges in Brazil, with three million customers. The company also invested in Paxos, a stablecoin issuer and blockchain infrastructure provider.The amounts invested in each of these companies were not provided, but the company informed that the objective of the investments was to “stimulate the regional ecosystem, allowing it to offer increasingly relevant products and services to Latin American entrepreneurs and users, who are at the heart of its strategy.”On this investment, Andre Chaves, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development for Mercadolibre, stated:2TM and Paxos share this vision and our conviction to continue innovating to offer solutions which improve people’s lives, generate value and drive the development of our region. We want everyone to be able to access the digital assets market in a simple and transparent way, this is our goal.The company’s relationship with cryptocurrencies is not new.

165,Bitcoin's Price Drop and the Network's Higher Difficulty Squeezes BTC Mining Profits,"Jan 23, 2022","After Bitcoin’s mining difficulty jumped to the highest value ever at 26.64 trillion, the overall hashrate slumped a hair due to the rise in difficulty and lower bitcoin price. This weekend, Bitcoin’s hashrate is coasting along at 189 exahash per second (EH/s), after dropping to a low of 167 EH/s three days ago. The lower price and difficulty rise has put a squeeze on bitcoin mining profits. Bitcoin’s hashrate remains high after the network saw the mining difficulty reach an all-time high of 26.64 trillion on January 20, 2022. That day, the network difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) increased 9.32% and the next DAA epoch is set to change in 11 days.The last change makes it a lot harder for miners to find a bitcoin (BTC) block subsidy and more difficult than ever before during the last 13 years. Another obstacle bitcoin miners faced this past week is the fact that BTC’s price shed 17.9% over the last week.Both the higher difficulty and the lower price make it less profitable for miners. With 189 EH/s of SHA256 hashrate dedicated to the chain, it doesn’t seem like these factors have slowed miners down. Although, aggregate profits stemming from bitcoin mining rig statistics indicates that SHA256 miners are feeling the pressure from both the price drop and difficulty rise.Currently, the top bitcoin mining rig on January 23, 2022, using $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and current BTC exchange rates, makes around $9.41 per day. The mining rig, Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro processes around 110 terahash per second (TH/s). The second-most profitable miner on Sunday is Microbt’s Whatsminer M30S++ with roughly 112 TH/s.The Whatsminer M30S++ gets an estimated $9.12 per day in profit using current BTC exchange rates. Two weeks ago, these two mining devices were getting $13-16 per day in profits, and two weeks before that, profits were up to $25 per day per machine.Following Microbt’s M30S++ machine, are three models from Bitmain stemming from the S19j series, which process between 96 to 104 TH/s. These three models make an estimated $8.23 to $8.91 per day in profit. The sixth most profitable mining rig today is Microbt’s Whatsminer M30S+, which processes around 100 terahash per second.The M30S+ pulls around 3400W of electricity off the wall and with electricity rates at $0.12 per kWh and current BTC exchange rates, the mining rig can profit by $7.28 per day. A great number of older bitcoin mining machines, with less than 28 TH/s in processing power, are having a hard time grabbing profits unless the electricity rates are lower than $0.12 per kWh.This means that older generation units, like the well known Bitmain S9, are far less profitable today than they were when BTC prices were higher and mining difficulty was less.What do you think about the profits miners are making with the current bitcoin price change and mining difficulty increase? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

167,"Bitcoin Price Slips Below $36K, BTC Dominance Increases, Billions Leave Crypto Economy","Jan 22, 2022","The price of bitcoin tapped a new low this year hitting $34K per unit at just after 5 a.m. (EST) on Saturday morning. Bitcoin is now down over 48% lower than its all-time high (ATH) reached two months ago on November 10, 2021 — when it jumped above the $69K mark. During the last week alone, bitcoin has lost 17% in value and a great number of traders and investors are curious as to when the carnage is going to end.It’s been a blood bath in the world of cryptocurrencies this week, as bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dragged every coin down with it. Today, the entire crypto-economy has lost 11% in the last 24 hours. BTC has been on a downtrend since the crypto asset’s ATH, and since December 27, 2021, back when BTC was trading for $52K, bitcoin has lost more than 32% in value against the U.S. dollar.Just after 5 a.m. (EST) on Saturday morning, BTC’s value dropped to its lowest point of the year so far, tapping $34,000 per unit. The leading crypto asset’s 24-hour range has been between $39,177 and 34,000 per BTC. While BTC has dropped in value a great deal during the last 48 hours from $43,400 to the current $35.5K to $36K per unit, BTC dominance has increased significantly.At the time of writing, BTC’s market dominance is 39.5% which is 5.33% higher than it was on January 6, 2022. Ethereum dominance, on the other hand, has dropped to 17% and a myriad of other crypto assets shed lots of dominance percentages as well. Out of the top ten crypto assets, polkadot (DOT) shed the most during the week, losing 32.1%.Furthermore, solana (SOL) is down 30.5% in seven days, and ethereum (ETH) has dropped by 24.6% since last week. BNB is down 23.9% and xrp (XRP) and terra (LUNA) are both down 21.2% over the last seven days. BTC and ADA saw the least amount of percentage losses this week as ADA shed 12.4% and BTC dropped 16.8%.The crypto economy has shed quite a bit of value this past week, and it has a lot of people talking about the crash on social media. Vertical trends on Twitter indicate hashtags like #cryptocrash and #bitcoincrash are trending alongside discussions about Michael Saylor and Microstrategy’s bitcoin stash. People have been wondering whether or not Saylor and Microstrategy will sell their BTC holdings and people have questioned Tesla holding its bitcoin long term as well.Meanwhile, most of the crypto supporters on Reddit forums and social media channels like Twitter, have no idea when the carnage is going to end. While a number of crypto advocates believe the bearish markets are almost over and new ATHs are on the horizon, others believe BTC could drop even further, below the $20K zone.Youtuber Colin Talks Crypto tweeted that he believes the bull run is not over. “Bitcoin’s price has crashed enormously,” the crypto Youtuber wrote. “Many are fearful and panicking. This is understandable. Zoom out. We’re still up from the July 2021 drop to $29K. For me, the bull run isn’t over unless the bitcoin price is below $29,000 (and not just a momentary dip below it).”What do you think about the recent bitcoin price plunge and how it dragged down the entire crypto-economy? Do you expect more bearish crypto prices or do you think the bull run is not entirely over? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

During Friday’s early morning trading sessions, bitcoin plunged to a low of $38,250 per coin. Furthermore, the market capitalization of the entire crypto-economy has slipped under the $2 trillion mark, down 7.5% to $1.94 trillion.The price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $40K zone for the first time in 122 days. BTC lost roughly 8% during the last 24 hours and during the last month, bitcoin has shed 21% against the U.S. dollar.Bitcoin’s 24-hour price range has been between $43,508 and $38,250 per unit. At the time of writing, BTC has a market valuation of around $735.8 billion. Bitcoin’s market valuation is around 38% of the $1.94 trillion crypto-economy today, while ethereum’s (ETH) market cap is 17.7%.The top trading pair with BTC on Friday is tether (USDT) with 51.86% of all trades. Tether is followed by the U.S. dollar with 21.75% and the stablecoin BUSD with 7.71%. BUSD is followed by EUR (4.86%), JPY (4.25%), KRW (3.05%), and USDC (1.69%).The second-largest crypto asset, ethereum (ETH), is down 9.1% over the last 24 hours and 29.1% during the last month.

All five of these coins lost 25% to 33% of their value during the last week.On Friday morning, Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, shared his analysis of bitcoin’s current market price with Bitcoin.com News. Balani says that the current outlook continues to remain in the bear’s favor.“BTC slipped below the psychological support of 40K amid continued sell-off in risky assets. With this fall Bitcoin has corrected ~40% since hitting ATH in November last year,” Balani said. “We expect BTC to find a bid around the 35K mark, close to 50% from the top. In the short term, we can bounce to challenge the 45K-50K zone but the overall outlook remains bearish as liquidity remains tight.”Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker Globalblock, suggests that BTC may currently be undervalued.“It is important to note that the crypto fear and greed index remains in extreme levels of fear – this usually represents a buying opportunity,” Sotiriou explained. “Also, on-chain metrics continue to be bullish, as net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), which shows the magnitude of Bitcoin holder unrealized profit and loss, as a proportion of the Market Cap, is currently trading at 0.43, the lowest level of network profitability since July 2021.” The Globalblock analyst added:This emphasizes the fear surrounding the market now, as many are capitulating at a loss. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin is undervalued at current price levels due to what has happened in previous episodes of extreme fear.What do you think about today’s bitcoin price action and the rest of the crypto market moves?

Nonetheless, the company stressed that customer funds were never at risk.Crypto.com revealed Thursday the number of users affected by the unauthorized crypto withdrawals that occurred on Jan. 17 and the cryptocurrencies stolen. The company wrote:The incident affected 483 Crypto.com users. Unauthorized withdrawals totaled 4,836.26 ETH, 443.93 BTC and approximately US$66,200 in other currencies.At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is $42,083.95 and ether is $3,178.94 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. Therefore, the value of BTC and ETH stolen during the hack is over $34 million.The CEO of Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, commented on the security breach on his platform in an interview with Bloomberg Wednesday.Noting that his company invests heavily in cybersecurity, he detailed, “We have 200 professionals around the world who collectively spend the last few years building a very robust infrastructure,” which he said has multiple layers.“In this particular incident, some of these layers were breached,” he admitted. However, he pointed out: “We were back up and running in about 13, 14 hours, and during the same day, all the accounts that were affected were fully reimbursed, so there was no loss of customer funds.”Marszalek said that the incident was a great lesson and his company will continue to strengthen its infrastructure.Regardless of the funds stolen, the CEO noted:One has to remember that given the scale of the business, these numbers are not particularly material and customer funds were never at risk.Marszalek was then asked what Crypto.com is doing to make sure that a security breach like this does not happen again in the future. The executive replied, “There are additional layers of security that we are implementing as well as some new programs.”One of the new security measures is the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP) which Crypto.com announced Thursday with the postmortem. The company claims that the WAPP “offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com app and the Crypto.com exchange.” The program restores funds up to $250,000 for qualified users.Since the Crypto.com exchange is based in Singapore, Marszalek was asked whether he has been contacted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank, which regulates the crypto sector in the country. He replied:At this stage, we did not see any outreach from the regulator.“We are a regulated business in multiple jurisdictions so we expect this and we are putting together a report that we will share whenever an inquiry comes in,” the Crypto.com executive concluded.What do you think about the Crypto.com hack and 483 accounts compromised?

176,Bitpay Statistics Show the Use of Bitcoin for Payments Is Dwindling,"Jan 18, 2022","The use of bitcoin as a digital currency for payments has gone down significantly, according to the numbers stemming from Bitpay, one of the leading cryptocurrency payments processors. While most of the purchases were made with bitcoin back in 2020, this dominance has dwindled, opening the space for other tokens and currencies, such as ethereum and stablecoins, to enter the crypto payments arena.Bitcoin’s use as digital payments currency has dwindled since 2020. This was the conclusion that Bitpay, one of the leading cryptocurrency-based payment processors, had when reviewing the numbers the market left them last year. Bitpay told Bloomberg that the dominance of bitcoin for purchases in its platform went down from 93% during 2020, to 65% in 2021. This loss of almost a third of its dominance has to do with the entrance of other currencies into the payment arena.The rise of stablecoins and the popularity that some meme coins enjoyed last year also reached the payments arena, albeit in a small way. Bitpay explained that users of the platform paid with ether 15% of the purchases, while stablecoins accounted for 13% of the payments last year. Other newcomers like shiba inu, dogecoin, and litecoin accounted for 3% of the payments.While the use of bitcoin (BTC) for making payments certainly decreased during 2021, the use of cryptocurrencies for payments, in general, has managed to increase. The total volume of payments that Bitpay did in 2021 presented an increase of 51% year on year. This is a result of the popularization of cryptocurrencies and also of the rise in prices that the market experienced last year. On this, Bitpay’s CEO Stephen Pair stated:Our business ebbs and flows to some degree with the price, when the price goes down, people tend to spend less. We have not experienced as much of a decline in volume with this recent pullback.Bitpay, being one of the most recognized crypto payments companies and managing big volumes in sales, is still dwarfed by traditional payments companies like Visa and Paypal. But to Pair, the field is young and the company is in a very good position for the future. He declared:We really like where we are strategically. This space is still very young. A lot of it has to do with what we think about timing. In the next couple of years we are likely to see very substantial growth.Other traditional companies shave also entered the crypto payments area. Paypal announced it would start processing cryptocurrency-based payments In March.What do you think about the dwindling use of Bitcoin for payments? Tell us in the comments section below.

177,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero Hashrates Tap Lifetime Highs — Dash, ETC, LTC Hashpower Lower Than Prior ATHs","Jan 17, 2022","During the first month of 2022, both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s hashrates have climbed to all-time highs (ATHs). While Bitcoin’s hashpower surged to over 200 exahash per second (EH/s), Ethereum’s hashpower jumped to over 1 petahash per second (PH/s). A few mineable digital asset networks, however, saw their hashrates decline since their ATHs and the processing power behind these protocols hasn’t returned back to the highs captured long ago.At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s processing power is coasting along above the 200 exahash per second (EH/s) zone, after touching the ATH it captured on January 15. Six-month hashrate statistics indicate that on Sunday, January 16, 2022, BTC’s hashrate tapped a daily high of 216.50 EH/s.The top three mining pools on Monday, January 17, include F2pool, Foundry USA, and Antpool, respectively. All three pools have more than 15% of the global hashrate or 29 EH/s of hashpower.Six-month and all-time metrics also show that Monero’s network hashrate is coasting along at all-time high records as well, with about 3.49 gigahash per second (GH/s) at press time.In close to four days’ time, Bitcoin’s network difficulty is expected to increase 6.24% which will bring the network difficulty to an all-time high. The estimated difficulty after the next epoch change will be around 25.89 trillion, according to data at the time of writing.Ethereum’s network hashrate is also managing to hold the 1 PH/s range after first tapping this goal in December 2021. The top mining pool on the Ethereum network is ethermine.org with 295 terahash per second of hashrate, and the percentage of ETH hashrate on Nicehash is 3.66%.While networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero have seen all-time highs, networks like Litecoin have not seen new hashrate ATHs in recent times. LTC’s network hashrate on Sunday is 368.96 TH/s, but during the first week of July 2019, LTC’s hashrate tapped an ATH at 468.50 TH/s.Today, Dash has a hashrate of around 5.24 PH/s, but in September 2020 it hit 7.14 PH/s. In total, that’s a 26.61% decrease in the network’s hashpower in 16 months.The Ethereum Classic network has an overall hashrate of 20.37 TH/s on January 17, which is lower than the network’s ATH in June 2021 at over 23 TH/s.What do you think about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero’s recent hashrate highs?

178,Fidelity Expects More Countries to Acquire Bitcoin Citing 'Very High Stakes Game Theory',"Jan 16, 2022","Fidelity expects more sovereign nation states, or even a central bank, to acquire bitcoin this year. “There is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers,” the firm explained.
Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, published a report on crypto trends and their potential future impact earlier this month. Among the trends discussed in the report is the adoption of cryptocurrency by sovereign nations.“This past year saw some major moves by world governments with regards to digital assets,” Fidelity described. The report discusses countries like China that have banned cryptocurrency and countries like El Salvador that took the opposite approach and made BTC legal tender.“We think the two developments observed this year couldn’t be more opposed. Time will certainly tell which path is more successful,” the report authors opined. However, they noted:An outright ban will be difficult to achieve at best, and if successful, will lead to a significant loss of wealth and opportunity.The authors continued, “We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers,” elaborating:Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance.Fidelity clarified, “In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future.” The investment firm concluded:We therefore wouldn’t be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, also predicted last week that two more sovereign nations will adopt bitcoin as legal tender this year. The CEO of Devere Group, Nigel Green, however, is more optimistic. He expects three more countries to adopt BTC as legal tender this year.Do you agree with Fidelity?

179,Jack Dorsey's Payments Company Is 'Officially Building an Open Bitcoin Mining System',"Jan 16, 2022","In mid-October 2021, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey revealed the payments firm Block Inc. (formally Square) was considering joining the bitcoin mining industry. Three months later, Dorsey tweeted that his firm was “officially building an open bitcoin mining system.”Jack Dorsey and the Block’s hardware general manager Tom Templeton discussed the company’s focus on bitcoin mining this week. Templeton explained that three months ago the Block hinted at building a bitcoin mining system and the firm has ultimately decided to step into the field.Templeton insists the goal is to make mining “more distributed and efficient in every way” and this includes maintenance, purchases, and setting up. “We’re interested because mining goes far beyond creating new bitcoin. We see it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless,” Templeton tweeted.Some of the problematic issues they had found people deal with when it comes to bitcoin mining include things like mining rig availability, machine reliability, and performance. “Some mining rigs generate unwanted harmonics in the power grid,” Templeton said. “They’re also very noisy, which makes them too loud for home use.”Templeton further added that the company has evaluated a number of “IP blocks, open-source miner firmware, and other system software offerings.”Moreover, the Block’s hardware team is building out a crew of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and software designers. Alongside this, Templeton noted the firm is also hiring electrical engineers, analog designers, and layout engineers.Data on January 16, 2022, shows there’s only a handful of ASIC bitcoin mining rig manufacturers today including Bitmain, Ebang, Canaan, Microbt, Innosilicon, Ipollo, and Strongu. Today’s top machines, in terms of profit per day and SHA256 terahash performance, are made by Bitmain, Ipollo, Microbt, and Canaan.A single Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro (100 TH/s) can cost anywhere between $10K to $15K per unit. This machine, in particular, using today’s BTC exchange rates and $0.12 per kilowatt-hour in electricity will generate an estimated $16.23 per day in profits.What do you think about Jack Dorsey’s payment company the Block getting into bitcoin mining?

With this rate of ownership, South Africa is now ranked number 21 out of the 27 countries whose internet users participated in the survey.According to the findings of the latest Finder survey, out of the 2,003 South African internet users that were surveyed, 11.3% said they own cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency ownership rate is said to be marginally higher than that of the United States (10.5%) and Sweden (9.8%).Still, as the survey findings show, South Africa’s latest cryptocurrency ownership rate is yet below the global average, which jumped from 11.2% in October to 15.5% in December 2021. From the total of 27 countries that were surveyed, South Africa is now positioned in 21st place.In terms of the popularity of different cryptocurrencies, the survey findings indicate that 56% of the crypto owners in South Africa own bitcoin. With this proportion of internet users that own BTC, South Africa is the second-highest ranked out of the 27 countries. However, the findings also appear to suggest that other cryptocurrencies are gaining ground.“Between now and the last survey, the number of crypto owners surveyed who said they held BTC has fallen from the 73.5% of respondents who said they own Bitcoin in October to 56% in December,” explains the Finder survey report.According to the findings, ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency with a share of 31.5%. This ownership rate, which is 7.1% higher than the global average of 24.4%, sees South Africa rank as the country with the eighth-highest proportion of internet users that own ethereum. In third place is XRP which is owned by 25.8% of the surveyed users while dogecoin and solana are in the fourth and fifth positions respectively.Meanwhile, the survey also found that out of those that said they own crypto, 62% are men and 38% are women. According to the survey report, this means South African “men are roughly 1.6 times as likely to own crypto than women.”On the other hand, the survey found that 48.7% of South Africans aged 18 to 34 are crypto holders. This figure is 16 percentage points higher than that of South African holders between the ages of 35 and 54.What are your thoughts concerning the findings of the latest Finder survey?

181,"Bitcoin's Hashrate Taps New Lifetime High, BTC Price 20% Above Production Cost, Difficulty Nears ATH","Jan 15, 2022","Bitcoin’s hashrate has been riding high again as the processing power tapped another lifetime high on January 15, 2022, reaching 219.68 exahash per second (EH/s). The new record follows the previous all-time high (ATH) on the first day of the year, when the network’s hashrate tapped 219.5 EH/s.Bitcoin miners are dedicating a lot of SHA256 processing power to the BTC network on January 15, as the network quickly reached an ATH just after 12:00 a.m. (EST). The record was just a hair above the previous ATH on January 1, at 219.5 EH/s as today’s hashrate reached a high of 219.68 EH/s. At the time of writing, the network’s hashpower is coasting along at 199 EH/s.The rise follows the recent drop in hashrate that happened while citizens of Kazakhstan revolted against the government and the internet was temporarily shut off in the country. It was widely speculated that the hashrate dropped 15% because of the issues in Kazakhstan but miners in the region claimed this was not the case. Data indicated at the time that BTC’s price drop and mining difficulty increase contributed to the 15% loss in hashrate.In addition to the price drop and difficulty increase, estimates say the production cost to mine a single BTC today is $34K. Twitter account and analyst Venture Founder recently explained that the production cost price point is around 20% below the current value. “The worst dumps bitcoin ever had, were due to miners’ capitulation (Dec 2018, Mar 2020), when bitcoin fell below production costs, it is at risk for miner capitulation,” the analyst tweeted. Venture Founder added:[Bitcoin] was at risk for miner capitulation at $30k in May. The current production cost is $34k, 20% below [the] current price.While it was expected to happen two weeks ago, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty will likely reach an all-time high during the next epoch change. The next difficulty change is expected to happen in just over 5 days from now and estimates indicate it might rise 3.83% higher than it is today. If it does rise to that point and reaches 25.31 trillion, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty will reach another lifetime high.The last mining difficulty ATH of 25 trillion was on May 13, 2021, and four difficulty decreases — including the largest epoch decrease ever — dropped the difficulty down a great deal. Since then, and after July 17, there’s been a total of 12 difficulty increases and just one decrease.On Saturday, the largest bitcoin mining pool is F2pool with 15.57% or 28.88 EH/s and the second-largest pool is Foundry USA with 15.55% or 28.80 EH/s. Both pools have been jumping back and forth during the last few weeks in terms of Bitcoin’s largest mining pool.What do you think about the recent hashrate high recorded on January 15, 2022, and the upcoming mining difficulty ATH that is expected to happen in five days?

183,"Kingdom of Tonga May Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender, Says Former Member of Parliament","Jan 14, 2022","The Kingdom of Tonga may adopt bitcoin as legal tender, according to a former member of Tonga’s parliament, Lord Fusitu’a, who tweeted about a possible timeline for this event to occur. Fusitu’a believes that by next fall a bill will be passed by Tonga’s parliament and bitcoin could be legal tender in the region by November.Tonga’s chairman of the Commonwealth Pacific Parliamentary Group on Human Rights, Lord Fusitu’a, is a bitcoin advocate and on January 11, he explained on Twitter that the Kingdom of Tonga’s government may adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The news follows El Salvador’s push to make bitcoin (BTC) legal tender last year. A few months ago, the law was codified by the Salvadoran congress and BTC was deemed legal tender in El Salvador.Lord Fusitu’a, who was once a member of Tonga’s parliament, claims the same thing will happen in Tonga. On Tuesday, an individual asked Lord Fusitu’a what the ETA was in regard to the Polynesian country legalizing bitcoin as tender.“Sept/Oct Bill goes to Parliament. Passed,” Lord Fusitu’a replied. “[It gets] sent to Palace Office for submission to His Majesty for Royal Assent. A month – HM, as advised by Privy Council, assents to Bill. 2-3 Weeks Gazetted by Govt activation date set.”Lord Fusitu’a added:On activation date [bitcoin] becomes legal tender.After Lord Fusitu’a tweeted out the five-point plan, a person asked whether or not “the bill passed already, or is it still with Parliament and ‘passed’ is the goal?” Lord Fusitu’a replied to the question and said: “The Bill will be submitted to the House in Sept/Oct. [Parliament] opens for [a] new session in June. June by law = National Budget. By Law, July Constituency visits. By Law August – Govts Legislative package for the year. By law, Sept/Oct Private MPs Bills may be tabled.”It’s not the first time Lord Fusitu’a has hinted about Tonga legalizing bitcoin as tender in the country. On July 5, 2021, on the podcast What Bitcoin Did episode 368, the former member of Tonga’s parliament explained how bitcoin adoption would be beneficial to Tonga.“The economy will first benefit by every customer having a disposable income increased by 30% and because our country imposes a 15% VAT, every person is putting an extra 30% into that 15% VAT, because they’ve got an extra 30% disposable income just from the rails,” Lord Fusitu’a said on the show.On the podcast, Lord Fusitu’a further explained:Simultaneously with that extra 30%, there’s some are going to be saving it rather than putting it into the economy and stacking sats which will appreciate. For the first time, someone who’s a village fisherman, and has been hand to mouth all his life, has a glimpse at possibly having savings that might be the foundation for financial freedom.As of now, it is uncertain whether or not Tonga’s active parliamentary members and the Tongan people will be willing to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. While El Salvador passed the bitcoin law, which was enacted on September 7, 2021, there was some opposition toward the government’s decision. Since then, president Nayib Bukele and the Salvadoran government have been adding BTC to the treasury and a bitcoin mining farm powered by volcanic energy was introduced.What do you think about the former member of Tonga’s Parliament hinting about the country adopting bitcoin as legal tender?

184,"Bitcoin ETF Launch Hype Fades as Funds Slip in Value, BTC Futures Open Interest Down 38% in 2 Months","Jan 14, 2022","Following the charged-up debut of the Proshares bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures ETF and the Vaneck bitcoin strategy ETF, interest in these types of funds seems to have faded a great deal. After the Proshares bitcoin ETF BITO reached an all-time high on November 10, the ETF is down 39% over the last 64 days. Valkyrie’s bitcoin ETF has also shed 37% in value over the last two months.A large portion of the cryptocurrency community was very hyped up for years about the launch of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), as a number of bitcoin ETF applications were denied prior to 2021.Finally, when the first U.S. bitcoin futures ETF was approved, the debut of Proshare’s bitcoin futures ETF smashed records, capturing close to $1 billion in total volume during the first 24 hours. Months later, the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is exchanging hands for $26.96 on January 13, 2022, but that price is 39.12% lower than the 44.29 high on November 10, 2021.Bloomberg author Katherine Greifeld explained in mid-November that the “bitcoin futures ETF frenzy is fading.” “While the Proshares fund absorbed $1.1 billion in just two days — the quickest an ETF has ever done so — that pace of growth has cooled considerably,” Greifeld said at the time.The financial author further discussed the Vaneck ETF, as she noted that lower management fees could differentiate the fund from the rest. At the time, Greifeld quoted Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, who said:There’s definitely a lull going on right now relative to the launch mania and so Vaneck has their work cut out for them in trying to get people excited again.The same can be said for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) when it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $26.67 per share on November 9, 2021, and today it’s changing hands for $16.70 per unit or 37.38% down from the ATH.The Vaneck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) is only down 27.70%, as the ETF exchanged hands for $58.08 per unit on November 19, 2021, and today it’s trading for 41.99 per unit. While Proshares and the Valkyrie ETFs debuted well before Vaneck’s offering, all of the funds have a strong relationship with spot price of bitcoin and the crypto asset’s futures markets.Futures markets have seen a decline in open interest, as total bitcoin futures open interest across cryptocurrency exchanges has declined since mid-November as well. The highest number of bitcoin futures open interest was on November 11, 2021, with over $28 billion.Today, the aggregate open interest across the most popular derivatives exchanges is $17.22 billion. That equates to a loss of 38.50% over the last two months and the pattern is quite similar to bitcoin’s (BTC) spot market price action.What do you think about the three bitcoin futures ETFs and their overall performance during the last few months? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

According to the company, Luxor’s new trading desk will give miners and investors access to bitcoin ASIC mining rigs “at a fair market price.” The bitcoin mining firm Luxor aims to purchase and sell bitcoin mining machines via the company’s new ASIC trading desk service.

Luxor’s ASIC trading desk announcement details that the company is confident in its equipment procuring process.“After moving tens of thousands of machines and serving miners across a few continents, we established a streamlined process for procuring equipment. Our multinational team has a deep network of ASIC manufacturers, re-sellers, miners, and investors,” Lauren Lin, Luxor’s operations manager remarked during the announcement.The move to establish a mining rig trading desk follows Foundry’s mining machine marketplace announcement last December. The market is called Foundryx and the firm’s announcement claimed at the time that it had 40,000 mining machines ready for resale. During the first week of June 2021, Canaan revealed the company has established an overseas after-sales center in Kazakhstan.Luxor says the firm will take “principal positions in ASICs to help miners gain access to rigs at fair market prices. “Our ASIC Trading Desk is an important step on our roadmap to becoming a full-scope mining services firm,” Alex Brammer Luxor’s VP of business development explained. Brammer added:Whether it’s an institutional miner replacing a fleet of new-generation machines or retail buying one rig, we are able to maximize our clients’ capital efficiency and minimize their risk. Our goal is to simplify the procurement process so our miners can spend more time building hashrate and less time worrying about how to find it.What do you think about the Luxor ASIC trading desk?

Seba Bank is a digital assets banking platform licensed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).Regarding the price of bitcoin this year, he said:We believe the price is going up.

The question is always timing,” he noted.When asked if his bank’s prediction refers to the price of bitcoin in 2022 and whether BTC will test some of the record highs seen last year, Buehler replied: “I think so, though volatility remains high.”The Seba Bank boss further explained that institutional investors will help boost the price of bitcoin in 2022.

Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, explained that his objective for bringing the app to the country has to do with providing a platform for Argentinians to hold a stable value in cash. This value will be held in the form of USDT, with no option for storing bitcoin, at least at launch.Strike, a popular bitcoin-based wallet, has launched in Argentina, bringing a new way for Argentinians to store their savings via stablecoins. The announcement of this development was made by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, who explained that due to the financial woes the citizens of the country are experiencing, there is a migration to foreign currencies such as the dollar.Mallers stated:There is now unprecedented demand for an open monetary system that lives within a distributed network, has a known monetary policy, a fixed supply, and is resistant to censorship.Mallers further explained that Strike, in its Argentinian installment, will offer “a stable cash balance that can be spent both instantly and with no fees.”While Strike is known for its Bitcoin and Lightning Network capabilities, it launched in Argentina with USDT as its backbone. This was considered strange by some local media outlets, considering that Mallers has publicly been a big supporter of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and that Strike has implemented these services in other locations already, including El Salvador.The current version of the application for Argentina uses USDT, the popular stablecoin issued by Tether, as a backbone to store value for users. USDT has a market cap of more than $78 billion dollars, being the most valuable stablecoin project in the whole cryptocurrency market. The USDT version that Strike uses is an ERC20 token, which uses the Ethereum blockchain.However, as Strike is a custodial wallet, users won’t have to deal with the high fees that are plaguing some ethereum users currently, as transactions using Strike are free of charge. In its terms of service the wallet explains that Bittrex is used for the custody of the assets, and that the company is not responsible for the custody of the cryptocurrency in its wallet.What do you think about the launch of Strike in Argentina?

189,Jack Dorsey Introduces Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund to Protect Open Source Developers,"Jan 12, 2022","A recent letter published to the Bitcoin developers mailing list written by Square founder Jack Dorsey indicates that a legal defense fund has been created for open source developers in order to protect them “from lawsuits regarding their activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem.” Dorsey’s letter is also signed by Alex Morcos of Chaincode Labs and Martin White, the co-founder of Hudson River Trading.According to an open letter from Jack Dorsey, Alex Morcos, and Martin White, “the Bitcoin community is currently the subject of multi-front litigation.” While the letter does not specifically detail any of the legal cases developers are dealing with, it mentions that “individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support.”However, the letter does hint at the Tulip Trading lawsuit, which involves Craig Wright, the Australian who claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto and the inventor of Bitcoin. “The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is a nonprofit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects such as the Lightning Network, Bitcoin privacy protocols, and the like,” the letter from Dorsey, White, and Morcos states. The open letter continues:The fund’s first activities will be to take over coordination of the existing defense of the Tulip Trading lawsuit against certain developers alleging breach of fiduciary duty and provide the source of funding for outside counsel. At this time, the fund is not seeking to raise additional money for its operations but will do so at the direction of the board if needed for further legal action or to pay for staff.The letter explains that interested people with questions or concerns can email the fund’s team and the email domain “bitcoindefensefund.org” is mentioned. The website seems to be under construction at the moment, as a message from the domain host Namebright notes the site is “coming soon.” Of course, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund became a trending topic on social media after the open letter was published.Open source developer Bryan Bishop tweeted that he was “very grateful to see Jack’s support on the Bitcoin Developer Legal Defense Fund.” Bitcoiner Marty Bent wrote: “Shoutout to Jack, Alex Morcos, and Martin White for stepping up to protect Bitcoin developers from getting bogged down by lawsuits so they can focus on what they do best. Really cool to see come through the bitcoin-dev mailing list this evening,” Bent added.What do you think about the Bitcoin Developer Legal Defense Fund information Jack Dorsey published on the developers’ mailing list on Wednesday?

He also commented on whether investors should buy bitcoin.Gundlach is the CEO of Doubleline Capital, which has over $137 billion in assets under management (AUM). He is sometimes referred to as the “Bond King” after he appeared on the cover of Barron’s in 2011 as “The New Bond King.” Institutional Investor named him “Money Manager of the Year” in 2013 and Bloomberg Markets named him one of “The Fifty Most Influential” in 2012, 2015, and 2016. According to Forbes, his net worth is currently $2.2 billion.He was asked whether there will be a recession in 2023. “I think the bond market is already showing enough of a recession indicator that by 2023 it seems pretty likely,” Gundlach replied.“I don’t think a lot of the Fed officials, economists, and investors appreciate the fact that the economy keeps buckling at lower and lower interest rates, so I think the Fed only has to raise rates four times and you’re going to start seeing a plethora of recessionary signals,” he warned, adding:It’s certainly a non-zero probability that you get a recession in the later part of 2022.On Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that the Federal Reserve might have to raise short-term interest rates more than four times this year. “It’s possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it’s just four increases this year,” said the JPMorgan boss.Earlier this month, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania warned about inflation and predicted that the Fed will hike rates “many more times than the market expects.”Regarding bitcoin, Gundlach stressed that the cryptocurrency is “for speculators.” Citing recent BTC price movements, he opined:At the present moment, I would advise against bitcoin … Maybe you should buy it at $25,000.Noting that he has never owned any bitcoin, the Doubleline CEO admitted, “That’s just not in my DNA.”He elaborated: “Bonds fit my culture of cowardice. I’m not a momentum investor at all, and in fact I’m sort of an anti-momentum investor, and I think bitcoin is for momentum investors only.”What do you think about Jeff Gundlach’s comments?

Bukele explained that the power coming from the volcanoes, managed and maintained by a state company called Lageo, produces more than 1,000 gigawatts for the nation yearly.The company is now adding more wells to increase its power production. According to statements from Bukele, the company is preparing the inclusion of four new wells to the system, that would contribute to production. One of the more advanced wells will supposedly be able to provide more than 95 MW (megawatts) of energy to the national grid. Regarding the nature of the energy provided, Bukele stated:[It will be] clean, cheap and renewable energy, from a source that will last at least a couple of million years.On the topic of powering Bitcoin City with geothermal energy, Bukele stated that they are also drilling new wells for this purpose. According to an article published by the presidency of the country, Bukele stated:We have a 90% probability of finding a well (with capacity) to (contribute) at least 42 MW. Enough to provide energy to the entire Bitcoin City.He further explained that if the city has more power demand than was anticipated, other wells that are in preparation can be used to supplement it. Bitcoin City, announced September 2021, is to be powered with energy from the volcanoes that is renewable and green.However, the project has been criticized by some that believe the volcanoes around the city are unable to produce this energy. This is the case of economist Steve Hanke, who said that the volcano which will supposedly power the city (the Conchagua) was inactive. However, Bukele rebuffed this position by stating that most geothermal wells were constructed around inactive volcanoes.Others have also criticized the usage of geothermal energy for mining bitcoin in the country, stating that it could end in an environmental disaster.What do you think about El Salvador’s new investments in geothermal energy?

193,"Bitcoin's Hashrate Slides 15% in 10 Days, Price and Difficulty Puts Pressure on BTC Miners","Jan 10, 2022","The price of bitcoin has been on a long losing streak since November 10, 2021, when the leading crypto asset tapped an all-time high at $69K per unit. During the last two weeks, bitcoin has shed more than 19% in value, and the network’s hashrate has dropped from over 200 exahash per second (EH/s) to 174 EH/s losing roughly 15% in ten days.This week the civil unrest in Kazakhstan caused a lot of people to speculate on whether or not it would affect Bitcoin’s global hashrate. The reason for this assumption is because it is estimated that Kazakhstan accounts for at least 18% of the global hashrate, according to the most recent estimates from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF). Looking at the 30-day chart for Bitcoin’s (BTC) hashrate indicates that the protocol’s hashpower lost roughly 15% in ten days.Reports stemming from Kazakhstan indicate that the civil unrest has stabilized and the country’s Data Center Industry and Blockchain Association of Kazakhstan (NABCD), said the issues did not affect digital currency miners. There were a few issues that may have affected bitcoin miners over the last week that are not associated with the problems in Kazakhstan.Five days ago, bitcoin (BTC) was exchanging hands for $46.5K per unit but the price slid more than 10% in value. Moreover, over a month ago, the best performing mining rig with more than 100 terahash per second (TH/s) would get $25 to $30 per day, per machine, and an electricity rate of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour. Today, that same mining rig will produce $14.87 per day at the time of writing, using the same electrical consumption. The bitcoin price drop could most definitely affect the hashrate and could be one of the reasons it has dropped 15%.Another reason why the hashrate dropped 15% could be because of the last mining difficulty increase. The last increase took place on January 8, 2022, as the network’s mining difficulty jumped 0.41 % higher. While that may not be that much of an increase, the difficulty is awfully close to the metric’s all-time high, and the network has seen three consecutive increases in a row. In more than 11 days from now, the mining difficulty is expected to increase again, up 0.67% from where it is today.Currently, pool distribution statistics over the last three days show F2pool and Foundry USA are the world’s top mining pool today, as both pools have 16.74% of the global hashrate each or 29.03 EH/s per pool. There are 13 known mining pools dedicating SHA256 hashrate to the BTC chain and unknown hashrate represents 1.40% of the aggregate or 2.42 EH/s. Despite the recent hashrate drop, from December 31 up until today, the hashrate is up 26.08% since the day before the new year.What do you think about Bitcoin’s hashrate losing 15% in the last ten days? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

They’re going to see those as attractive levels to buy,” he said.The CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, talked about the outlook for the cryptocurrency market in an interview with CNBC last week. He was asked about the falling prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin.“Part of the bitcoin story was the debasement of fiat currency and as the Fed looks to get more hawkish, some of that comes off,” he explained.“Crypto had a monster year last year. It’s hard to think you’re going to grow to the sky nonstop. This is a pullback,” he stressed, adding:We see a tremendous amount of institutional demand on the sidelines. I’m not nervous in the medium-term.Nonetheless, Novogratz cautioned, “We are going to have a lot of volatility in the next few weeks.”Novogratz was also asked if he thought there was a floor at $38,000 for bitcoin after he said, “you will find a lot of support for bitcoin” around $38K to $42K. The Galaxy Digital executive replied:I know big institutions who are going through their process to put positions on. They’re going to see those as attractive levels to buy.“On the charts, $38,000, $40,000 feel like where we should bottom,” he emphasized. On Friday, Novogratz tweeted, “We entered the buy zone…”The price of bitcoin fell more than 12% over the past week. At the time of writing, the price of BTC is $41,955.39.This was not the first time Novogratz said institutional investors see bitcoin’s declining price as an opportunity to buy. He made a similar statement in June when the price of BTC fell below the $30K level.In September, he said that the crypto market was in good shape despite the falling prices of cryptocurrencies. “The ecosystem is so much more mature. The amount of players that are moving in are so much more mature,” he explained. “Every single bank is working on their own crypto project, how they can get bitcoin to their wealthy clients.”Do you agree with Mike Novogratz?

However, he expects established cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, to “do quite well” once regulations come into focus.Mai Capital Management’s Chris Grisanti shared his outlook for the cryptocurrency market in an interview with CNBC Thursday. Grisanti, CFA, is chief equity strategist and regional president of Mai Capital Management, a wealth management firm that provides planning and investment advisory services.Noting that crypto is “almost a victim of its own success,” Grisanti detailed:I think it’s going to be a tougher year for crypto … There will be calls for regulation from all over the place — from China, from Europe, and here in the United States.Nonetheless, the equity strategist sees some cryptocurrencies coming out ahead. “I do think there will be a great winnowing as well. I think the more established coins like bitcoin and ethereum will do quite well after regulations come into focus,” he described.The strategist elaborated:Once regulations are in place, institutional investors, I think, will get more comfortable treating bitcoin not like a currency but like gold, which is a hedge against inflation and other things.A recent survey by Nickel Digital Asset Management, a regulated European digital asset hedge fund manager, also shows that institutional investors are optimistic about more regulation coming to the crypto industry.Commenting on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) being granted more power to regulate the crypto space, “73% of institutional investors and wealth managers believe this will have a positive impact on the price of crypto and digital assets and 32% believe it will have a very positive effect.”What do you think about the predictions by the equity strategist?

196,"Game on NFT™, a Work of Art That Celebrates Bitcoin and Bitcoiners","Jan 9, 2022","PRESS RELEASE. Chicago, IL – 9th January, 2022 – Denjary Watru, the creator of the Game On NFT™ has dropped an NFT that is sure to become highly sought after by all those who know and understand Bitcoin, its implications for society going forward, and who have an appreciation for the value of digital art. According to Denjary, the inspiration for the Game On NFT™ happened during his routine treadmill workout and while talking on the phone to a friend, attempting to explain Bitcoin.Surrounded by sports themed pictures on the walls of the exercise area of his home, he had the thought of using a football metaphor to help his friend (who loves football) to better understand Bitcoin. At the end of the call, when the friend said the metaphor had really helped him to get it, Denjary went to his desk and began sketching some of the ideas expressed during the call. Eleven months later, after assembling a team of creatives, the Game On NFT™ was born.The artwork is titled Game On because it symbolically characterizes the date that Satoshi (Bitcoin’s inventor) introduced Bitcoin to the world as the first provably scarce digital cash, making the concept of a digital asset a reality, as the beginning of a gutsy resolve to provide an exit from the fiat system. The Game On NFT™ tagline is “Its Game On…Until Its Game Over”. The artist incorporates more than twenty-one (21) different elements within the artwork that personify the Bitcoin story and its supporters. Knowledgeable Bitcoin enthusiast will recognize the symbolism used throughout the piece and appreciate the deep thought that went into each carefully selected image or meme that represents some key attribute of Bitcoin or the network. Since Bitcoin enthusiast are more than likely to own or have owned Bitcoin for some extended period, they are stakeholders in its success and will find value in an NFT that celebrates the story of the Bitcoin (the cryptocurrency that created the digital asset category).Also, since the Game On NFT™ is an inspired, custom, work of art, it differentiates itself from the crowd of randomized computer-generated groupings of pixelated art, that are presently an over-represented segment of the NFT art category. Many others in the crypto community will find the Game On NFT™ highly desirable, since besides being a piece of custom artwork, it can also be used as an educational tool to help others understand Bitcoin and grow its adoption.The Game On NFT™ is available on the OpenSea platform where prospective owners can choose a one of one seat and row in any of the eight sections, Cypherpunks, Full Nodes, Miners, Developers, Speculators, Maximalist, Merchants, or Consumers.

Brandt has been a futures and FX career trader since 1975. He is a chartist and the author of the Factor Report. He trades a variety of markets, including Dow futures, bonds, corn, crude oil, European wheat, Osaka Dow, U.S. dollar, and sugar.Replying to a comment on Twitter stating that there may be additional opportunities for long-term hodlers to buy even cheaper bitcoin in the coming months, Brandt wrote:A sacred trading rule I have used is never add to a losing trade.He explained in a tweet that people were saying the same thing about silver futures in 1980 after it topped $50. “lt then sank to a low of $3.65 and did not start back up for 24 years,” he stressed. The trader clarified, however, that he is not predicting that bitcoin will follow the same path.The price of bitcoin has fallen significantly this week, losing over 10% in the past seven days. At the time of writing, the price is $41,657.45 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Brandt commented on bitcoin’s violation of the parabolic advance on the Bitcoin Live discussion Thursday.However, he tweeted Friday: “I saw the violation of the parabolic advance and commented on it in real time to members of Bitcoin Live in real time, but in hindsight, I might not have taken the event seriously enough. We’ll see.”He followed up with another tweet. Noting that “Some view predictions as a ‘one-and-done’ event. I am [a] student of Bayesian probability. Predictions and analysis must always morph relative to the events of the time,” he concluded:When circumstances change, predictions must change. The parabola might not be the driving force in BTC.What do you think of Peter Brandt’s advice? Let us know in the comments section below.

198,CEO of Mirror Trading International Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Arrested in Brazil,"Jan 8, 2022","Johann Steynberg, the wanted CEO of Mirror Trading International was recently arrested by Brazilian law enforcement after he was caught using a fake document. The arrest, which took place in the country’s Goiás province, was carried out by the Brazilian military police. Johann Steynberg, the CEO of Mirror Trading International (MTI), a bitcoin Ponzi scheme, was recently arrested by Brazilian law enforcement after he was caught using a false document, reports from the South American country have said. Following the arrest, credit cards, laptops, and fake identification were also seized.As per several Portuguese language reports, Steynberg, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, was apprehended in the Goiás province by members of an elite unit within Brazil’s military police.In a statement confirming the arrest, the Brazilian military police also shared details of the steps taken before the decision to capture Steynberg was made. The statement explains:After an intense work of identification and follow-up, and with the help of information passed on by the Federal Police, it was possible to identify and approach the suspect, who presented a false document at the time of the approach.On top of being arrested for his role as the key mastermind behind the MTI bitcoin Ponzi scheme, the Brazilian military police said Steynberg must also pay a fine relating to his use of a false document.As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, Steynberg disappeared in late December 2020 when reports emerged that several MTI investors were unable to withdraw their funds. Shortly after his disappearance, a South African court ruled that MTI had to be placed under provisional liquidation.However, since then, other masterminds of MTI — which was named the biggest bitcoin scam in 2020 — have waged a battle to stall the process of liquidating the collapsed company. Meanwhile, a court ruling on a petition that seeks to have MTI declared an illegal business is still pending.What are your thoughts on this story?

201,"Mid-Way Cool Down: Analysts Believe Bitcoin Price Cycle Is Incomplete, Trader Says BTC’s 'Next Move Should Be Cycle's Top'","Jan 7, 2022","The price of bitcoin is down 16% over the last 30 days and since the crypto asset’s all-time high (ATH) on November 10, 2021, bitcoin has lost more than 38% since it surpassed $69K per unit that day. Meanwhile, crypto advocates are furiously debating whether this is a bitcoin bear market or if the bull market is still intact. To many observers bitcoin’s current market cycle is not complete, as no solid peak had formed, and speculators still expect another bubble to come to fruition.Many digital currency traders pay attention to tops and bottoms and the four stages of the market cycle. The stages include the accumulation phase, the uptrend phase, the distribution phase, and the downtrend or capitulation phase. One could say that the accumulation phase took place 666 days ago on March 12, 2020, when the price of bitcoin slipped below the $4K per unit zone. On that day in March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the world was dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak and dubbed it a “pandemic.”If you were wondering why this cycle's bull run looks a little different from the previous ones. It's just the beginning. 🚀 #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/q3X3z51x6X— Bitwatch 🟠 (@TheBitwatch) January 3, 2022On that day, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday,’ global markets worldwide were roiled and the crypto economy shed billions in a matter of no time, but the crypto economy recovery and accumulation phase started the very next day. The price of bitcoin (BTC) continued to uptrend and moved steadily into the markup phase as BTC had finally surpassed the $20K 2017 all-time high. By January 7, 2021, BTC’s price touched $40K for the first time in history. In mid-May, BTC’s price made it to the $66K zone for the first time and slipped below that region shortly after.Bitcoin’s price slid below the $40K zone around September 21, 2021, and people claimed that the price top was not in yet. They were correct as 50 days later, the price of bitcoin (BTC) hit a lifetime price high at $69K per unit on November 10, last year. Still, crypto advocates believe that the bull cycle is not over and one more parabolic uptrend may be in the cards. Most bitcoiners try to measure cycles by leveraging the time between BTC’s halving cycle.In the 1st and 2nd #Bitcoin halving cycles, price hit a linear 4.236 fib extension before finding support near linear 2.618 and moving higher.In the 3rd #Bitcoin halving cycle, price has hit a linear 4.236 fib extension and is trying to find support near linear 2.618. pic.twitter.com/7EbsaaXRAA— TechDev (@TechDev_52) January 5, 2022Typically, because of bitcoin’s scarcity, the price rises before the reward halving, and the next halving is expected 850 days from now on May 6, 2024. That’s still more than two years away and people wholeheartedly believe that the bull market that led BTC to $69K is still in play. Bitcoiners are still expecting a double-bubble similar to 2013 where the price exceeds the $69K zone and peaks higher. Crypto market pundit Bobby Axelrod thinks that in early February observers will witness the next big move.“This next leg up, this next 60-day cycle beginning,” Axelrod tweeted. “Early February will be THE MOVE. Where bitcoin’s price ends up after the next move should be the cycle top IMO. At least I will be treating it as such.”Crypto supporter Colin, host of the Youtube show “Colin Talks Crypto” thinks the market cycle has been lengthened. “Because of the apparent lengthening cycle of this bull run, I now think it is *more likely* for us to see a $300,000 bitcoin price than a mere $100,000 bitcoin price,” the Youtuber said on January 5. The same day, Colin tweeted:I’m happy that the bitcoin price is crashing— not because I like the price to go down, but because it means the upside surge is sooner to come. It’s like, ‘let’s get this crash over with so we can move into more bullish territory!’Many other crypto supporters feel the same way. The Twitter account dubbed “Wicked Smart Bitcoin” wrote: “Perfect place to bounce IMO. Rekt everyone who longed at $43k and now everyone short (expecting a break down to $40k) will get rekt. Choppity chop chop. Don’t trade or use leverage. Just buy spot, self custody, and HODL for a cycle or two. Let hyperbitcoinization do its thing.”The Twitter account called @therationalroot shared a chart of all the bitcoin price cycles and the all-time high (ATH) price positions that were recorded within the cycles. “The 2021 cycle so far gave us 32 blue dots (ATH’s),” the bitcoin advocate said. “We had 72 in the 2017 cycle and 52 in the 2013 cycle. Let the fireworks for 2022 begin.” The trader, entrepreneur, and investor Bob Loukas described the cycle as a “midpoint puke.” Loukas said:Day 31 of the bitcoin Cycle, the midpoint puke. The overlay is the Cycle from May 23rd – July 20th 2021. Not a fan of overlays, I don’t trade off them, but similar conditions. I think $40k was always the more important level. More important is the early [February] timing.Currently, bitcoin’s logarithmic growth curve shows three bull runs with extreme peaks yet the current cycle looks incomplete and almost undecided. The chart shows that there have only been two times in bitcoin’s price history where it slid below the yellow low dev line, and the last time it happened was on March 12, 2020 (Black Thursday). The end of the chart and the yellow low dev line indicates that BTC’s price won’t go lower than $25K if it maintains the power-law corridor model without deviation.It’s safe to say that most bitcoiners even with the most advanced technical analysis skills are unsure of where bitcoin’s price is headed. Tai Zen, the crypto trader, entrepreneur, and CEO of the trading web portal cryptocurrency.market says people should wait until the bear market to acquire altcoins.“Bitcoin is on sale under $50K (laser eye price),” Zen tweeted. “We do not recommend buying any coins during the middle of a bull market. However, if u have extra cash & itching to jump into crypto, then the only coin I would buy is BTC [and] nothing else,” Zen added.What do you think about bitcoin’s current price cycle?

203,"Chinese Crackdown Bolsters Bitcoin Mining in Thailand, Bigger Investors Eye Setting Up Operations in Laos","Jan 7, 2022","A crackdown on bitcoin mining by China has led to an increase in the number of Thai investors that have acquired and are operating mining rigs, a report has said. The report adds that many of these investors are currently earning between $30 and $40 per day from each mining rig. The number of bitcoin miners in Thailand surged in 2021 after China’s ongoing crackdown on bitcoin mining forced major players in the industry to quit or to ship their equipment to countries with friendlier regulations.As explained in an Aljazeera report, a brief price drop that followed the restrictions made it possible for many smaller investors to acquire the mining gear from the fleeing, China-based miners. Although prices of mining rigs have since returned to more than $13,000 for each new machine, it’s suggested that demand for the machines has not waned.To support the assertion that Thai investors are still buying the mining gear, the report quotes Pongsakorn Tongtaveenan, a businessman who has been buying the Antminer SJ19 Pro from miners fleeing China and selling these to local investors. In the report, Tongtaveenan offers his thoughts as to why his fellow countrymen are investing in the mining rigs.He said:Bitcoin is the gold of the digital world. But a mining rig is like gold mining stocks: you’re paid dividends according to the gold price. There’s around 100,000 Thai miners now.According to the report, some of these miners are earning between $30 and $40 from running the machines. For others, like one unnamed bitcoin enthusiast-turned-miner, the Chinese crackdown proved to be an important turning point.“The moment China banned crypto, we were ecstatic. I made it all back in three months,” said the miner who claims to have used $30,000 to kickstart his solar-powered mining operation.Meanwhile, bigger Thai investors are reportedly considering setting up operations in neighboring Laos, which recently gave mining licenses to six companies and where the cost of electricity is cheaper. However, just like other potential investors, Thai investors that wish to invest in Laos will have to meet the initial terms which include buying electricity worth $1 million from the Laotian state grid per annum as well as paying a large operating fee.What are your thoughts about this story?

He is more bullish than El Salvador’s president who predicted that two countries will make bitcoin their national currency.The CEO of Devere Group, an independent financial advisory and asset management firm, predicted earlier this week that three more countries will adopt bitcoin as legal tender in 2022.His prediction is more bullish than the one made by El Salvador’s president one day prior. The Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, predicted that two more countries will adopt BTC as legal tender this year.“I’m confident that the young, maverick President, Nayib Bukele, is correct about other countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2022,” Green said, emphasizing:But I would go further still. I believe possibly three more nations will follow El Salvador’s pioneering, future-focused lead into the digital age.“This is because low-income countries have long suffered because their currencies are weak and extremely vulnerable to market changes and that triggers rampant inflation,” he opined.The Devere CEO added: “By adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender these countries then immediately have a currency that isn’t influenced by market conditions within their own economy, nor directly from just one other country’s economy.”Green further noted that cryptocurrencies could help “bolster financial inclusion for individuals and businesses” in developing countries. The Devere boss concluded:Due to their similar reliance on remittances, amongst other factors, other countries, including Panama, Guatemala and Honduras, could also adopt bitcoin.How many countries do you think will adopt bitcoin as legal tender this year?

205,Goldman Sachs Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $100K as BTC Continues to Take Gold's Market Share as Store of Value,"Jan 6, 2022","Goldman Sachs has predicted that the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000. The global investment bank believes that bitcoin will continue to take market share away from gold as cryptocurrency adoption grows.Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange strategy, outlined the future outlook for bitcoin in a research note to clients Tuesday.The Goldman Sachs analyst expects that bitcoin will continue to take market share away from gold in 2022 as cryptocurrencies become more widely adopted. The research note details:Bitcoin may have applications beyond simply a ‘store of value’ — and digital asset markets are much bigger than bitcoin.The analyst noted that bitcoin’s float-adjusted market capitalization is currently under $700 billion. The cryptocurrency accounts for a 20% share of the “store of value” market, which comprises gold and bitcoin. This market is worth about $2.6 trillion, the note explains.In its list of 2022 predictions, Goldman Sachs said bitcoin will “most likely” become a bigger proportion over time.Pandl said that if bitcoin’s share of the store of value market were “hypothetically” to increase to 50% over the next five years, the price of BTC would increase to just over $100,000. The analyst added:We think that comparing its market capitalization to gold can help put parameters on plausible outcomes for bitcoin returns.Furthermore, the Goldman Sachs analyst pointed out that even though the Bitcoin network’s consumption of resources may be an obstacle to institutional adoption, it will not stop the demand for the asset, the note said.Goldman Sachs relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk last year. In June, the firm expanded its cryptocurrency offerings to include ether futures and options.Do you agree with Goldman Sachs about bitcoin and gold? Let us know in the comments section below.

206,"Kazakhstan Shuts Down Banks, Internet Amid Unrest That Threatens Bitcoin Mining, Hashrate","Jan 6, 2022","Measures imposed by authorities to quell mass protests in mining hotspot Kazakhstan are affecting cryptocurrency markets and the Bitcoin network hashrate. To deal with the civil unrest caused by rising fuel prices and a worsening economy, the government restricted access to the internet and closed down local banks. Fears are rising that the turmoil may spark another major migration of miners now that some are already leaving the country, which also faces power shortages. Thousands of Kazakhstanis took to the streets this week to express their anger over the socioeconomic conditions in their country after the government removed a cap on prices of natural gas and other fuels. Protests erupted in the country’s largest city, Almaty, the capital Nur-Sultan, and in the western Mangistau province. Authorities have imposed a state of emergency.Over 1,000 citizens have been injured, official media reported, during the demonstrations in which government offices were attacked, guns fired, and people killed both among protesters and law enforcement officers. On Jan. 5, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev dismissed the government, blaming ministers for the situation that threatens to spiral out of control. Russia has already sent “peace keeping” troops after Tokaev asked the allied country for help in the face of a “terrorist threat.”Kazakhstan has been largely offline in the past couple of days, with disruptions affecting phone connections as well. The monitoring group Netblocks revealed on Wednesday that the country is in an internet blackout. On Thursday, the state-run Khabar 24 TV news channel confirmed that access to the world wide web has been restricted with users being unable to reach social media platforms and messaging apps.Meanwhile, all bank offices across the nation have been closed down, according to a representative of the National Bank of Kazakhstan quoted by the Russian Interfax news agency. The official, Olzhas Ramazanov, explained that the regulator has made the decision after “taking into account temporary internet interruptions as well as to protect the health and life of employees of financial institutions and consumers of financial services.”The rapidly developing events in Kazakhstan affected cryptocurrency markets and the price of bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $44K mark on Wednesday when the crypto economy shrank by around 4.5% to $2.25 trillion, as Bitcoin.com News reported. The cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization is trading under $43,000 per coin at the time of writing on Thursday.Amid the crackdown on crypto mining launched by the Chinese government in May, Kazakhstan became a magnet for companies involved in the minting of digital currencies, thanks to its capped electricity rates and generally positive attitude towards the industry. The country’s average monthly hashrate share exceeded 18% last year, with the Central Asian country turning into a major mining hotspot.Starting the new year at almost 229 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Jan. 1, the mean hashrate of the Bitcoin network fell below 170 earlier this week. It currently stands at 167.86 EH/s, at the time of writing. Members of the crypto community have expressed fears that a further deterioration of the situation in Kazakhstan could affect the indicator even more as miners may begin to relocate to jurisdictions with a more stable political environment and power supply.While Kazakhstan initially welcomed mining companies and has taken steps to regulate the sector, authorities have blamed the country’s growing problems with electricity shortages on the influx of mining companies. The power deficit exceeded 7% in the first three quarters of 2021 and interruptions in energy supply have already forced some businesses to shut down crypto farms and move equipment to other mining destinations such as the U.S.Do you think the crypto world will witness another major migration of miners in 2022 due to the events in Kazakhstan?

207,"Bitcoin Dominance Sinks to Lowest Level in 3 Years as Ethereum, Numerous Competitors Gain on BTC","Jan 6, 2022","Bitcoin dominance has dropped to the lowest level in just over three and a half years since June 3, 2018, at 37%. Last year, at the end of March, bitcoin dominance hovered just above the 60% zone but since then, numerous digital asset market caps have swelled in value and gathered prominence in the market rankings along the way. The crypto economy currently has roughly 12,247 crypto assets traded across 542 exchanges worldwide. Crypto markets have shed more than 7% over the last 24 hours, dropping to a low of $2.16 trillion by 8:00 a.m. (EST).While people measure the individual crypto market capitalizations regularly, bitcoin’s market valuation dominance, compared to the rest of the capitalizations, has been measured since the existence of multiple crypto markets.During the first few years, BTC dominance was well above the 90% range, in terms of market capitalization dominance. Dominance was recorded more so during the month of May 2013, and at that time, BTC dominance was 94%.This was measured against crypto assets like namecoin, novacoin, litecoin, terracoin, feathercoin, and freicoin. Between May 2013 and February 2017, bitcoin’s market dominance remained above 80%.However, since February 26, 2017, bitcoin has not been able to jump back above the 80% zone and has only managed to get as high as 70% just over a year ago, last January.BTC’s dominance is currently coasting along at 37.7% while ethereum (ETH) commands 18.6%. While ethereum is a formidable foe, many other crypto caps have been moving in on bitcoin’s dominance territory.Tether, binance coin, solana, usd coin, cardano, and xrp command more than 15% of the $2.18 trillion crypto economy. The aforementioned coins, plus terra, polkadot, avalanche, dogecoin, and shiba inu equate to 20.63% of the crypto economy.All of these coins, including ethereum and removing SHIB, hold more than 1% or more in crypto market valuation dominance. Since January 2021, when BTC’s dominance was 70%, a myriad of altcoins have been nipping at bitcoin’s market cap heels.What do you think about bitcoin’s low dominance levels today?

He highlighted “two simple reasons” why he is bullish about the price of bitcoin this year.Antoni Trenchev, the co-founder and managing partner of Nexo, a major cryptocurrency lender, has shared his bitcoin price prediction in an interview with CNBC Monday. He said:I think [bitcoin’s] going to reach $100,000 this year, probably by … the middle of it.Nexo has issued more than $6 billion in credit and manages assets for more than 2.5 million users globally.The executive explained that there are “two simple reasons” why he expects to see big gains in the price of bitcoin.Firstly, he pointed out that institutions are increasingly putting bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. The Nasdaq-listed company Microstrategy, for example, has bought 124,391 BTC for its treasury.Another reason is that Trenchev expects “cheap money” is here to stay, which would boost the prices of cryptocurrencies. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates several times this year. Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel recently predicted that “The Fed is going to have to hike many more times than what the market expects.”The Nexo executive added:I quite frankly think that as soon as we see a rate hike, it’s going to be a dip into equities and the bond market — and quite frankly, the last few years, we haven’t seen much political will to … power through any sort of correction in the traditional financial markets.Recently, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, also predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $100,000 this year.Meanwhile, the CEO of Microstrategy, Michael Saylor, foresees bitcoin’s price reaching $6 million.

212,Kickstarting the Bitcoin Network: A Look at the Genesis Block and Source Code That Sparked a Financial Revolution,"Jan 3, 2022","13 years ago today, the anonymous creator of the Bitcoin protocol kickstarted the network by mining the genesis block. Satoshi started the genesis block on Saturday, January 3, 2009, at precisely 1:15 p.m. (EST), and since then more than 700,000 blocks have been mined into existence.Today, bitcoiners and cryptocurrency advocates worldwide are celebrating the 13th anniversary of the Bitcoin network’s launch. On this day, 13 years ago, Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto launched the genesis block, otherwise known as “block zero.” There are several unique characteristics of the genesis block that make it different than the blocks that followed.For instance, the genesis block has a 50 BTC block reward subsidy that can never be spent. Block zero also has two more leading hex zeroes in the hash which was common for bitcoin blocks mined in the early days. The genesis block also contains a special message stored in the coinbase parameter. The message derives from a London Times January 3, 2009 headline and reads:The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.Many people are unaware that the Bitcoin protocol did not produce another block until six days after the genesis block was mined. It is assumed Satoshi had a reason for this wait time, as it resembles something out of Machiavellian folklore or the King James Bible’s Genesis tale when the earth was created in seven days.Satoshi Nakamoto mined the Bitcoin network with a standard personal computer or central processing unit (CPU). It is assumed Nakamoto was a Microsoft user, and the protocol’s codebase was written in the coding language C++. In addition to the coding language, users leveraged a Windows GUI mining application to mine BTC blocks back then.When bitcoiners examined a pre-code release prior to Jan. 3, 2009, distributed to bitcointalk.org member “Cryddit,” a number of interesting findings were discovered. For instance, the document mentioned the term “bitcoin miner” for the first time, and it also referred to the blockchain as a “timechain.” The pre-release Bitcoin source code also contained an early framework for an IRC Client, a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace, and a virtual poker game.Additionally, according to Bitcointalk.org user Deepceleron on Dec. 23, 2013, and a few other armchair sleuths, “there’s no source code to recover off Sourceforge through the Internet Archive, but here’s a screenshot from January 3, 2009, (same date as genesis), with an unreleased blockchain at block 213 and three other connections.” It is assumed by some people that Nakamoto and some early users may have tested the blockchain launch prior to January 3, 2009.Last year, on the 12th anniversary of the genesis block, a mystery miner spent 1,000 BTC from 2010 after letting the bitcoin sit idle for well over a decade. The 13th anniversary follows BTC’s lifetime price high on November 10, 2021, when the crypto asset tapped $69K per unit. Furthermore, on January 1, 2022, the network’s hashrate reached an all-time high of over 200 exahash per second.On January 9, 2009, Bitcoin’s hashrate was around 68.96 kilohash per second (KH/s) or 68,000 (sixty-eight thousand) hashes per second (H/s). That also equates to around 0.068 megahash per second (MH/s) or 0.000068 gigahash per second (GH/s), too low of a denomination to measure in terahash per second (TH/s).Whoever was mining at this time on January 9, 2009, and the following week (we assume it was Satoshi Nakamoto), was still dedicating more computational power than it would take to mine bitcoin (BTC) with paper and pencil (0.67 hashes per day) or a Nintendo Game Boy (0.8 H/s). Since that day on January 9, 2009, the network’s hashrate has grown exponentially stronger by a whopping two hundred sixty-seven quadrillion percent.What do you think about the 13th anniversary of the Bitcoin network’s genesis block?

213,Argentinian Government Inquires About Energy Bitcoin Mining Companies Use Amidst Power Cuts,"Jan 3, 2022","The Argentinian government is starting to inquire about the power consumption of bitcoin mining companies after some provinces in the country faced power cuts during the last days of 2021. Cammesa, the state-owned power wholesaler, has sent a memo to big power consumers to reveal whether they are mining cryptocurrency. If so, the companies should reveal their actual power consumption so a price hike can be coordinated, and they will need to invest in power infrastructure.The Argentinian government is trying to pinpoint the exact power usage that bitcoin miners require from the national power grid, in order to take measures to improve the current power crisis the country is facing. Cammesa, the state-owned energy wholesaler, has sent a letter to all registered large-scale consumers, requesting they report the energy consumption of possible mining operations they may host, including the power consumed by what the company calls the “server group,” the refrigeration equipment to cool the miners, and other associated equipment.According to local media reports, the Argentinian government — via the Undersecretary of Electric Energy — could be planning to take action to get miners to pay more for this energy, launching a new tariff scheme and making cryptocurrency miners invest in the power system directly. This with the objecting of relieving the stress these operations are said to be causing the national grid, which in some cases has faced power cuts affecting more than 80,000 citizens and provoking protests.Local cryptocurrency experts explained some companies have migrated to offer their space to host cryptocurrency mining operations, something that has affected the grid negatively. An unnamed source disclosed that these businesses were common and that there are more than 200 farms of this kind in the country, with at least half of them operating in Buenos Aires, the Argentinian capital.The reason for the covert operations popping up is said to be the profitability investors can achieve by avoiding taxes. Doing things covertly can speed up return on investment (ROI) times for mining investors, who can reportedly recover their investment in six months, compared to ROI times of up to 18 months for other operations.Bitcoin mining companies have been eyeing Argentina due to its affordable power costs. One of these groups is Bitfarms, which is already building a mega-mining complex in a partnership with a private third party that will ostensibly provide the power without impairing the national grid.What do you think about the new measures the Argentinian government is planning to take regarding bitcoin mining?

He expects two more countries to adopt bitcoin as legal tender this year. Meanwhile, he expects El Salvador’s Bitcoin City to commence construction during the year and his country’s volcano bonds to be oversubscribed.The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, tweeted on Jan. 1 his six predictions relating to bitcoin for the year 2022. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in September last year.Firstly, President Bukele expects the price of BTC to reach $100,000. Secondly, he believes that two more countries will adopt bitcoin as legal tender.El Salvador has purchased about 1,391 BTC altogether since bitcoin became its national currency.Bukele is not the only one who expects more countries to adopt bitcoin as legal tender by the end of 2022. The CEO of crypto exchange Bitmex, Alex Hoeptner, predicted in October last year that by the end of this year, “we’ll have at least five countries that accept bitcoin as legal tender.” He noted that “All of them will be developing countries.”Furthermore, the Salvadoran president expects Bitcoin City to commence construction this year. He announced his plan to build the world’s first bitcoin city powered by a volcano and financed by bitcoin bonds in November. He also said there would not be any taxes in the bitcoin city except for value-added tax (VAT). Another prediction Bukele made was that the volcano bonds will be oversubscribed.His Bitcoin City announcement came one day before the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a report warning El Salvador against using bitcoin as legal tender due to various risks associated with cryptocurrency. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey also raised concerns about bitcoin being used as legal tender in El Salvador.Bukele also predicted there will again be a “huge surprise” at the Miami Bitcoin Conference 2022 and that BTC “will become a major electoral issue in U.S. elections.”What do you think about the 2022 predictions by El Salvador’s president?

He also said that bitcoin has become the new gold for the millennials.Wharton’s finance professor Jeremy Siegel shared his outlook for various markets that he believes investors should have exposure to this year in an interview with CNBC Friday.Siegel is Russell E. Palmer Professor Emeritus of Finance at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. His research focuses on demographics, financial markets, long-run asset returns, and macroeconomics.He was asked about gold and commodities as investments going forward. Noting that gold “has been disappointing,” he stressed that “it’s a fact that the young generation is regarding bitcoin as the substitute” for gold. The professor opined:Let’s face the fact, I think bitcoin as an inflation hedge in the minds of many of the younger investors has replaced gold … Digital coins are the new gold for the millennials.“Old people remember the 1970s,” he continued. “That inflation time, gold soared. This time it is not in favor,” he noted.Professor Siegel also believes that investors should have exposure to commodities, which he said could be done by investing in emerging markets, which are commodity-sensitive.The finance professor proceeded to discuss inflation, which he has raised concerns about on multiple occasions. “I’ve been saying this for a long time. I’ve been warning about inflation for a year and a half,” he emphasized.“The Fed and the fiscal authorities so way overdid it, particularly the Fed on liquidity,” he described. “They are so far behind the curve that we have a lot of inflation that is embedded in.” The professor concluded:The Fed is going to have to hike many more times than what the market expects.What do you think about the finance professor’s inflation warning and his comment about bitcoin and gold?

216,Billionaire Ray Dalio Insists Governments Could Outlaw Bitcoin,"Jan 2, 2022","Billionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has reiterated his warning that governments could outlaw bitcoin. “In history, they’ve outlawed gold and they’ve outlawed silver and so on, and they could outlaw bitcoin,” he stressed.Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio talked about bitcoin as he reiterated his warning that governments could outlaw the cryptocurrency on the Investor’s Podcast Network, published Saturday. Dalio currently serves as Bridgewater Associates’ chairman and co-chief investment officer. His firm’s clients include endowments, governments, foundations, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds.Dalio warned that “there are regulatory issues” surrounding bitcoin. “When you have an alternative currency, that’s a threat to every government,” he elaborated. “Every government wants a monopoly in their own currency and particularly if you get a better currency because it doesn’t get devalued.” Dalio added:In history, they’ve outlawed gold and they’ve outlawed silver and so on, and they could outlaw bitcoin.Nonetheless, Dalio admitted that he has a small amount of bitcoin in his portfolio for diversification. “I’m Mr. diversification,” he said. The Bridgewater Associates boss also recently revealed that he also owns some ether (ETH).Commenting on the recommendation by another famous fund manager, Bill Miller, who said that investors should hold about 1% to 2% of their portfolio in bitcoin, Dalio said, “I think that’s right.”Despite the worry that governments may ban bitcoin, Dalio opined:It’s very impressive that this concept was programmed something like 10, 11 years ago and has stood the test of time.The billionaire previously said he does not believe that bitcoin will replace gold as some people have suggested. He also does not believe that the price of BTC could reach a very high number such as $1 million.In contrast, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor has repeatedly said that bitcoin will replace gold. The pro-bitcoin executive also expects the price of BTC to reach $6 million. In addition, fund managers are increasingly opting to invest in bitcoin over gold, seeing the cryptocurrency as a better store of value.The Bridgewater Associates founder has warned about governments banning bitcoin for quite some time. In September last year, he said that regulators will kill bitcoin if it becomes “really successful.” In addition, he said in May last year that the success of cryptocurrencies could bring tough regulations. For example, he noted regulators could impose “shocking” taxes on digital currency.Do you agree with Ray Dalio? Let us know in the comments section below.

During the last 12 months, Bitcoin’s hashrate has increased by 47.92% from the 141.55 EH/s recorded on January 3, 2021.The processing power and security dedicated to the Bitcoin (BTC) network has never been higher, and the network tapped a milestone in 2022. According to the one-year hashrate chart hosted on coinwarz.com, BTC’s hashrate tapped a high of 209.39 EH/s on January 1, 2022. At the time of writing, the hashrate is still coasting along the two hundred three quintillion hashes per second (H/s) zone, and 30-day statistics indicate the network briefly tapped 224.32 EH/s on Saturday.Bitcoin.com News recently reported on the BTC network reaching 194.95 EH/s not too long ago on December 8, 2021. It’s also worth noting that the Ethereum (ETH) network also reached an all-time high tapping 1 petahash per second (PH/s).On December 22, 2021, the Ethereum network reached 1.0122 PH/s and today’s metrics show ETH’s hashrate is still above the 1 PH/s on Sunday. On January 3, 2021, Bitcoin’s hashrate was 141.55 EH/s or 47.92% lower than today’s BTC hashpower statistics.Moreover, on June 28, 2021, China’s crackdown against BTC miners caused the hashrate to plummet to 69.11 EH/s. The network’s hashrate has grown ​​202.98% since that day as a great majority of mining operations relocated to other countries. At the time of writing, the largest bitcoin mining pool is Foundry USA with 19.45% of the global hashpower or 34.79 EH/s. The second-largest mining pool in terms of global hashrate is Antpool with 16.91% of the hashrate or 30.25 EH/s.There’s only 11 known mining pools mining BTC today and 3.81% of the global hashrate stems from unknown hash or stealth miners. BTC miners have faced two bitcoin mining difficulty increases during the last two epochs. On December 11, the difficulty jumped 8.33% and on the 25th of December, it increased by 0.32%. Bitcoin’s next mining difficulty change will bring it awfully close to the difficulty’s all-time high at 25 trillion. In just over five days, the difficulty is expected to increase by 2.90% to 24.98 trillion.What do you think about Bitcoin’s global hashrate growing 47% during the last 12 months and tapping an all-time hashrate high on January 1, 2022?

218,"Kevin O'Leary Reveals Crypto Strategy, Why He Prefers Ethereum, Says NFTs Will Be Bigger Than Bitcoin","Jan 1, 2022","Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, has shared his cryptocurrency investment strategy and which coins he owns. He also discussed crypto market bubbles, diversification, regulation, and why he thinks non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be bigger than bitcoin.Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary discussed cryptocurrency, his investment portfolio, diversification, market bubbles, meme coins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a recent interview with Forbes, published Friday.He explained that he views “the entire crypto industry as software development teams,” adding that he is betting on “really strong creative software engineers.” While talking about his cryptocurrency holdings, he revealed:Ether is my largest position, bigger than bitcoin.“It’s because so many of the financial services and transactions are occurring on it,” the Shark Tank star described. “Even new software is being developed like Polygon that consolidates transactions and reduces the overall cost in terms of gas fees on Ethereum.”O’Leary then mentioned some of the cryptocurrencies he owns, stating:I own hedera, polygon, bitcoin, ethereum, solana, serum — these are bets on software development teams and there are many, many use cases for them.Moreover, Mr. Wonderful added that he holds “a significant and material position in USDC,” noting that he is “starting to pay for assets and get paid in the stablecoin.”“At the end of the day, what determines the platform’s success and value is the speed and level of adoption. That occurs when the team has developed a platform that solves an economic problem,” he opined.O’Leary proceeded to offer his opinion about meme cryptocurrencies. Noting that “long term coins that have no economic value are that because they don’t solve anything or create any value,” he cautioned:I’m very skeptical of meme coins long term.The Shark Tank star was also asked whether he thinks bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. He replied: “The thing to realize is, the market is the market. No one person can manipulate it, even though people claim they can … It’s millions of decisions being made every second in terms of what something is worth. And it applies to every market, whether it’s tulips, watches, bitcoin, real estate or gold.”Noting that “Over the long run, it’s a fool’s game and you can’t win,” he stressed:You can’t know when it’s a bubble, you simply can’t. And if you think you do, you’re absolutely wrong.O’Leary believes in portfolio diversification. The cryptocurrency portion of his portfolio has been growing. He detailed that at some point cryptocurrency “might get to 20% of my operating company — but right now, it’s about 10.5%.” He clarified:Within that portfolio, there’s no one token coin or chain that’s more than 5% of that portfolio. So yes, I am actively adding and trimming based on volatility.In addition, he said that he is doing a lot of staking. “Most of my positions are now being staked,” he confirmed, noting that he’s using the crypto exchange FTX for staking. Mr. Wonderful announced in October that he is taking an equity stake in the crypto exchange and will be “paid in crypto to serve as an ambassador and spokesperson for FTX.”When asked whether there is a chance that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could determine some of the cryptocurrencies he owns to be securities and what he will do if that happens, O’Leary promptly replied:The minute that information gets out, I will want nothing to do with them. If I had a position I would sell it. I have no interest in going into conflict with regulators over my crypto portfolio. I want to be 100% compliant.He said the same about XRP in November. XRP is the subject of an SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. “I have zero interest in investing in litigation against the SEC. That is a very bad idea,” he stressed.O’Leary also discussed non-fungible tokens (NFTs). “They offer so much value around authentication, inventory management, and all kinds of use cases in different asset classes,” he described, adding:I think non-fungible tokens are going to be bigger than bitcoin.He proceeded to draw attention to his NFT project. “I prefer NFTs tied to hard assets, physical assets; the one that I’m working on developing a white paper for is the watch industry,” he said. “I made a material investment in Jordan Fried’s company, Immutable Holdings, which owns nft.com, which he’s launching in January, as well as Wonderfi.”What do you think about Kevin O’Leary’s comments?

219,Gold Bug Peter Schiff Claims Bitcoin's Yearly Gain of 60% Was Achieved in First 5 Weeks of the Year,"Jan 1, 2022","Gold bug Peter Schiff has claimed that though bitcoin went up by 60% during the past twelve months, most of these gains were achieved during the first five weeks of the year in 2021. He insists that the majority of those that bought the asset in 2021 have not gained.With the calendar year ending and bitcoin up more than 60% since last January, one of the crypto asset’s chief critics, Peter Schiff, has claimed in a tweet that this gain was only achieved in the first five weeks of 2021. Schiff argues that the majority of people who bought the digital asset in 2021 have not gained.Indeed, after starting 2021 trading at just above $29,300, the price of bitcoin — as shown by Bitcoin.com data — more than doubled and was trading just above $63,500 by mid-April. This is in contrast to Schiff’s gold which started the year trading at around $1,900 per ounce but had dropped to $1,730 at around the same time.While prices of both assets continued to fluctuate throughout 2021, year-end data shows that the crypto asset had again outperformed gold after it recorded double-digit gains once more. This performance suggests that despite it being a very volatile asset, it still generated positive returns for investors, even after February.Gold, on the other hand, ended the year nearly 4% lower, a fact Schiff does not mention in one of his last anti-bitcoin tweets of 2021. Instead, he uses the crypto asset’s price in February 2021 to support his argument that bitcoin has not generated positive returns for a majority of investors. Schiff said:Bitcoin bulls point to bitcoin’s 60% gain in 2021 as more evidence that it’s the best asset to buy. But all of those gains occurred during the first five weeks of the year. Bitcoin is lower now than it was in Feb. The vast majority of people who bought Bitcoin in 2021 are down.Besides bitcoin, which ended the year 60% higher than it started, numerous other cryptocurrencies also outperformed gold. Ethereum, which hit an all-time high of $4,891 in November, had a net gain that surpassed 500% by the end of 2021.Also, a Bitcoin.News report shows that about ten crypto assets had gains of more than 10,000% during the same period.Schiff’s tweet has riled bitcoin proponents. For instance, in their response to the gold bug’s latest attack on BTC, one Twitter user named Moon Landing asked why Schiff worries too much about bitcoin. Another user, Benjamin Cowen suggested that gold no longer keeps up with inflation. He tweeted:“The vast majority of people who bought gold over the last decade have just watched it not even keep pace with inflation.”Do you agree with Peter Schiff’s latest claims?

The chief of police noted:The arrested man was remanded for four days and is being investigated under Sections 379 and 427 of the Penal Code and the Electricity Supply Act 1990.In July, Malaysian authorities completely destroyed 1,069 bitcoin mining machines with a steamroller. The coins were confiscated earlier this year.What do you think about this case? Let us know in the comments section below.

Today, metrics indicate there are 59 companies, a few countries, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with 1,499,493 bitcoin held in treasuries.Over the last 12 months, a great number of companies have disclosed that they have added bitcoin (BTC) to the firm’s balance sheet and even countries like El Salvador are now storing BTC in their national treasury.On March 1, 2021, Bitcoin.com News reported that there were 42 firms that consisted of public and private companies, alongside bitcoin funds as well. At the time 1,350,073 BTC was held by the company’s and it represented 6.43% out of the 21 million maximum supply.Now similar to Microstrategy announcing a BTC purchase every so often, the Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele has also been telling the public about El Salvador’s BTC acquisitions. For instance, El Salvador purchased 21 BTC to celebrate the 21st day, year, and century on December 21.The Bitcoin Treasuries list hosted on buybitcoinworldwide.com shows that there are 59 companies that hold BTC on their balance sheets and five different countries. At the time of writing, the web portal claims 1,499,493 BTC is held by these entities.This equates to $71.6 billion in USD value and 7.14% of the 21 million BTC supply cap. Now the Bitcoin Treasuries list notes that five countries own BTC and the first one on the list is Bulgaria, however, the stash of 213,519 BTC held by Bulgarian authorities is controversial and many people believe the coins were sold.In April 2018, the regional news publication Bivol explained that Bulgaria’s finance minister, Vladislav Goranov, explained that the BTC was sold. Goranov noted that the BTC was sold to “several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors.” It also noted that Deloitte and the FBI helped facilitate the sales and the BTC was sold for €15,000 per unit.If that stash is taken off the Bitcoin Treasuries list’s aggregate, the current BTC held by companies and four countries would be 1,285,974 BTC worth $61.1 billion. The Bitcoin Treasuries list then says El Salvador holds 1,391 BTC, the UK government holds 46,351 BTC, Finland has 1,981 BTC, and Georgia has 66 BTC.That would leave the Bitcoin Treasuries list down to ETFs, private companies, and public firms. The publicly listed company with the most BTC at the time of writing according to the Bitcoin Treasuries list is Microstrategy, with 122,478 BTC or $5.8 billion worth of coins.However, the company’s CEO Michael Saylor told the public it purchased 1,914 BTC on Thursday. The Bitcoin Treasuries list shows that Tesla and Galaxy Digital hold the second and third largest amount of bitcoin in terms of public companies.Tesla holds 42,902 BTC according to the list and Galaxy Digital has a stash of 16,400 BTC. Those two public firms are followed by Voyager Digital LTD (12,260 BTC), Square Inc. (8,027 BTC), and Marathon Digital Holdings (7,649 BTC).That leaves 39 public companies holding BTC on their balance sheets with firms like MOGO Financing (18 BTC), Phunware, Inc. (127 BTC), Coinbase Global, Inc. (4,482 BTC), and Brooker Group’s BROOK (BKK) (1,150 BTC).Six private companies hold bitcoin as well including Block.one (140,000), The Tezos Foundation (17,500), Stone Ridge Holdings Group (10,000), Massachusetts Mutual (3,500), Lisk Foundation (1,898), and Seetee AS (1,170).14 funds hold 809,848 BTC according to the list and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holds 648,069 BTC of that total. Following GBTC, there are funds like CoinShares / XBT with 48,466 BTC, Purpose Bitcoin ETF with 22,411 BTC, and 3iQ Coinshares Bitcoin ETF that holds 21,237 BTC.The Bitcoin Treasuries list gives a fairly good glimpse of a number of companies claiming to hold BTC on their balance sheet and it’s a great deal larger than it was last year. However, just like the discrepancy with the Bulgaria bitcoin stash mentioned above, none of the so-called “who owns all the bitcoin” lists are entirely accurate.In fact, without cryptographic proof, these types of lists don’t hold water when it comes to actual onchain verification and actual “proof-of-reserves.” Despite this issue, the lists are useful for a visual perspective, of what could be the case, if a majority of these entities are being truthful about their BTC reserves.What do you think about the Bitcoin Treasuries list at the end of the year? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

222,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk Praises Dogecoin, Criticizes Bitcoin, Guesses Identity of Satoshi Nakamoto","Dec 30, 2021","Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk says dogecoin is “fundamentally better than anything else” he has seen while he criticizes bitcoin. He also discussed the identity of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the official currency of Mars.Elon Musk shared his thoughts on cryptocurrency, dogecoin, bitcoin, and the identity of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in an interview with Lex Fridman, published Tuesday.Musk, who has long been a supporter of the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE), revealed:Part of the reason why I think there is some merit to dogecoin, even though it was obviously created as a joke, is that it actually does have a much higher transaction volume capability than bitcoin.“The cost of doing a transaction, the dogecoin fees are very low,” the Tesla executive added.In contrast, he said: “Right now, if you want to do a Bitcoin transaction, the price of doing that transaction is very high, so you could not use it effectively for most things, and nor could it even scale to a high volume.” Following the publication of this interview, many people took to Twitter to remind Musk of the Lightning network.This is not the first time Musk said that dogecoin is better than bitcoin for transactions. During his “Person of the Year” interview with Time Magazine, he noted that bitcoin is better as a store of value while dogecoin is better suited for payments. He also recently announced that his electric car company, Tesla, will start accepting DOGE.The Tesla CEO, who is sometimes known in the crypto community as the Dogefather, further opined:I’m not saying that it’s the ideal system for a currency but I think it actually is just fundamentally better than anything else I’ve seen, just by accident.Musk was also asked if he is still considering making dogecoin the official currency of Mars. He replied: “I think Mars itself will need to have a different currency because you can’t synchronize due to the speed of light, or not easily.”He explained: “Mars is, at closest approach, it’s four light minutes away roughly, and then at furthest approach, it’s roughly 20 light-minutes away, maybe a little more. So you can’t really have something synchronizing if you’ve got a 20-minute speed of light issue if it’s got a one-minute blockchain. It’s not going to synchronize properly.” The Tesla boss continued:I don’t know if Mars would have a cryptocurrency as a thing, but probably, seems likely. But it would be kind of localized thing on Mars.The Spacex boss was asked whether he is Satoshi Nakamoto as some people believe him to be. “I’m not,” he quickly replied. “Would you tell us if you were?” he was asked. “Yes,” he affirmed.He proceeded to share his theory of who Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, might be.“You can look at the evolution of ideas before the launch of Bitcoin and see who wrote about those ideas,” he began. While emphasizing, “Obviously I don’t know who created bitcoin for practical purposes,” he detailed:The evolution of ideas is pretty clear for that, and it seems as though Nick Szabo is probably more than anyone else responsible for the evolution of those ideas.“He claims not to be Nakamoto but I’m not sure that’s neither here nor there but he seems to be the one more responsible for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else,” Musk concluded.What do you think about Elon Musk’s comments?

224,Close to $50 Million in Bitcoin From 2011 Moved for the First Time in 10.5 Years,"Dec 30, 2021","On December 29, two addresses from 2011 containing 500 bitcoin each transferred 1,000 coins for the first time in 10.5 years. Furthermore, another wallet from 2011 woke up on Wednesday, moving 40 bitcoin for the first time in over a decade. On Wednesday, an address created on July 10, 2011, at 11:22 p.m. (UTC) with 500 bitcoin (BTC) transferred the BTC for the first time in 10.5 years. Another wallet, created on the same day in 2011, dispersed another 500 BTC worth more than $23 million at the time of transfer.Furthermore, a wallet from August 12, 2011, containing 40 BTC worth $1.8 million transferred coins for the first time in over a decade. At the time of transfer, BTC was trading for $47,500 per unit, and the aggregate 1,040 BTC from 2011 spent on Wednesday was worth over $49 million.One can assume the 1,000 BTC stemmed from the same owner as the bitcoin wallets were both created on July 10, 2011. It’s possible the 40 BTC could have been the owner as the 40 BTC wallet was created about a month later.There haven’t been that many 2011 bitcoin spends in December besides four previous 2011 transactions this month. Two coinbase rewards were spent on December 1 and December 14. Ten bitcoin (BTC) from a wallet created in 2011 was transferred on December 11 and 20 BTC from another wallet created in 2011, moved on the same day.The bitcoin wallet that sent 500 BTC sent the funds with a “moderate” level of privacy or a score of 65 according to blockchair.com’s privacy tool. Four issues were found during the send as “several indicators we were able to link the similar types of addresses involved in this transaction” including “matched addresses identified.”Bitquery.io data shows that one of the transfers may have been tethered to a known Coinbase address. Similarly, blockchair.com’s privacy tool gives the other 500 BTC transaction the same rating, and Bitquery.io data from that address shows money flow tied to a known Coinbase address.When the 40 BTC was transferred the privacy was lower and had a ranking of 45 according to blockchair.com’s metrics. Just like the previous two BTC transfers from 2011, the outgoing send was tethered to matched addresses.Bitquery.io statistics indicate that another known Coinbase address is tied to the wallet’s money flow. The 1,040 BTC sent on Wednesday follows similar patterns as many of the old coins transferred in 2021. Researchers from the Telegram channel “GFIS” and the creator of Btcparser.com told Bitcoin.com News that the old coins may be desired by exchanges.“We at (GFiS) have a theory on why some major exchanges may desire having old bitcoins,” the researchers said. “The presence of these old bitcoins may help to purify a whole pool of bitcoins that might already hold dark tones. And now if they mix it up with the white and shiny ones from 2010-2011, it will help all of them to pass through various AML and risk analysis bots.”Statistics from amlbot.com indicate that the addresses that sent the 500 BTC had low-risk assessments. The funds from the address that sent the 40 BTC derived from an address that once contained 31,723 BTC and emptied the last of its coin on May 11, 2012, when it sent 101 BTC.The transaction hash data that shows the 1,000 BTC sent, makes it look as though the funds derived from a miner as ten addresses sent 50 BTC to the wallet and 0.05437193 BTC was paid in fees. It’s not certain if these coins were sold on the open market or even over-the-counter (OTC), as the owner of these old school coins could have moved them to disperse them into addresses with smaller amounts of funds.What do you think about the 1,040 bitcoin from 2011 that moved for the first time in 10.5 years on Wednesday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

225,"Over 20,000 Bitcoin ATMs Installed in a Year","Dec 30, 2021","The number of cryptocurrency ATMs around the world has grown exponentially in 2021, with over 20,000 new installations made since last December. That’s more than the total of all crypto teller machines put into operation in the previous seven years.ATM locations offering users options to buy and exchange cryptocurrencies with fiat money are increasing at an unprecedented pace. Data compiled by Coin ATM Radar shows that their number towards the end of 2021 is nearing 34,000.In a year that saw crypto market all-time highs, over 20,000 new devices have popped up globally. According to the installations growth chart updated by the tracking website, bitcoin ATMs were fewer than 13,000 in December 2020 — that’s all ATM locations registered since October 2013 — while 12 months later they exceed 33,900.Crypto teller machines can be found in almost any corner of the planet but their spread is still quite concentrated. Around 30,000 of all BATMs (bitcoin ATMs), approximately 90% of the gross figure, are running in the U.S. Its northern neighbor, Canada, is a distant second with a little over 2,200 machines.Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador is already among the leaders with its 205 machines, overtaking EU countries such as Spain, which has less than 200, and Austria with its 142. As of Dec. 29, the whole of Europe has only 1,384 cryptocurrency ATMs, lagging behind key markets in North America.A number of companies now manufacture automated teller machines supporting cryptocurrencies. The biggest players in the market are Genesis Coin with almost 14,000 devices, General Bytes with more than 7,500, and Bitaccess with close to 5,000. Coinsource and Bitstop, with less than 2,000 each, complete the top five.At least 6,000 businesses maintain crypto ATMs in different parts of the world, with the 10 largest operators running 70% of them all. The largest companies in the sector are Bitcoin Depot, which holds a fifth of the market with over 6,600 machines, followed by Coincloud (over 4,600), and Coinflip (almost 3,500).The teller machines support various cryptocurrencies and are either one-way or two-way devices. The latter offers users the ability not only to buy, but also to sell their digital coins. Most BATMs provide an opportunity to purchase bitcoin (BTC), and many offer other major coins such as bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), and litecoin (LTC).Do you expect the number of bitcoin ATMs to continue to grow exponentially in 2022?

226,"As Bitcoin and Ethereum See Sharp Drops, 18 Crypto Assets Captured Double-Digit Gains Last Week","Dec 29, 2021","While the crypto economy shed billions in value this week, 18 different digital assets have accrued double-digit gains during the last week. At the same time, the top two leading crypto assets by market capitalization, bitcoin and ethereum, have lost between 2.8% to 6.2% in value in seven days.Bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) have lost a bit of value according to weekly statistics, and a number of alternative digital assets have done a whole lot better. Today, the crypto economy is worth $2.36 trillion and it is down 2.9% during the last day. BTC has shed 2.8% in value during the last seven days, and ETH has lost 6.2% since last week. However, 18 crypto tokens have accrued double-digit gains against the U.S. dollar this past week.For instance, Sushiswap’s decentralized exchange (dex) token sushi (SUSHI) has gained 67% during the last seven days. Near (NEAR) jumped 57.8%, fantom (FTM) climbed 49.6%, and oasis network (ROSE) spiked 48% during the course of the week. Other top weekly gainers included convex finance (+35.7%), aave (+33%), theta network (+24.8%), uniswap (+19.2%), osmosis (+18.2%), kadena (+16.8%), iota (+15.8%), and the sandbox (+15%).Cosmos, polkadot, enjin, monero, celo and curve token also saw double digit gains this week as well. Out of the $2.36 trillion in value, across more than 12,000 crypto assets, BTC’s dominance is 38.3% while ethereum’s dominance is 19.1%. Discussing bitcoin (BTC) prices with Bitcoin.com News, the co-founder of Huobi Group, Du Jun, said that the price of bitcoin tends to stabilize and traders should “pay attention to the changes in price direction.”“According to data from Huobi Global, BTC’s price stabilized during [the] daytime, after a sharp drop at night, fluctuating back and forth from $47,500, changing directions several times,” Huobi’s co-founder explained to our newsdesk. “From the 4h k-line, three EMA lines descended steeply, k-line was located near the lower rail of the Bollinger Bands, and the opening of the Bollinger Bands expanded significantly,” Jun added. The analyst further added:Although the decline has been blocked, the short side is still relatively strong, especially seen from the daily line. This decline has caused the BTC price to fall again at a similar rate after a one-week price increase, and there is a trend of forming a downward channel again. Short-term upside is less likely. In short term, pay attention to the changes in the price direction and the support of the $45,500 position below.While the values of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) have both seen declines, numerous alternative crypto assets are gaining on the dominant crypto markets. A recently published study indicates that altcoins have surged threefold since 2014, and 2021’s top ten performing crypto assets outshined BTC and ETH by a longshot in terms of gains. Despite the losses bitcoin (BTC) is still up 76.1% year-to-date (YTD) and ethereum’s YTD metrics indicate ether has gained 416%.As far as ethereum (ETH) markets are concerned, Huobi Global’s Du Jun said that ethereum markets were very similar to BTC’s market patterns. “[The] price of ETH stabilized during daytime after a sharp drop at night, oscillating slightly back and forth, changing directions several times, echoing the BTC price trend, and it is now near $3,800,” Jun added on Wednesday. Jun’s ethereum (ETH) market outlook continued:From the 4h k-line, the downward adjustment is strong and the momentum is relatively large. Each moving average descended steeply, and the trading volume increased. From [the] daily level, the downside trend is less obvious. In the short term, pay attention to the support of the 4680 position below. Once it breaks through, the price downward trend will be formed.What do you think about the 18 crypto assets that have recorded double-digit gains this past week? What do you think about the two leading crypto market assets’ recent performance? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

227,"Tokenized Bitcoin in Circulation Nears a Half Million BTC, Bitcoin-Pegged Token Value Exceeds $21 Billion","Dec 28, 2021","According to data recorded on December 28, there’s approximately 434,265.43 bitcoin-pegged or wrapped bitcoin tokens worth more than $21.3 billion across several blockchains. Ten different bitcoin-pegged projects exist today and the project Wrapped Bitcoin dominates 59.66% of all the tokenized bitcoin in circulation.Toward the end of 2018, when tokenization really started heating up in the crypto space, a number of different projects launched bitcoin-pegged token protocols. On January 30, 2018, Bitcoin.com News reported on the Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) project launching on Ethereum.By the end of July 2019, WBTC eclipsed the Lightning Network (LN) in terms of total value locked. Today, WBTC is the largest bitcoin (BTC)-pegged token project with 259,090 BTC in circulation on the Ethereum network.Statistics indicate that there are seven BTC-pegged projects on Ethereum and altogether, the seven projects command 323,264 BTC total value locked (TVL). The second-largest tokenized BTC protocol on Ethereum is HBTC with 39,884 BTC.HBTC is followed by RENBTC (17,054), SBTC (4,203), IMBTC (1,317), PBTC (888), and TBTC (828), respectively. Accordingly, the 323,264 BTC TVL held in Ethereum is 74.43% of the aggregate BTC-pegged tokens in circulation today.There’s another tokenized BTC protocol that leverages the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) called BTCB that’s just below WBTC in terms of TVL. At the time of writing, there’s around 105,115.44 BTCB in circulation on December 28.BTCB has a fully diluted market capitalization of around $5.52 billion and $43.6 million in global trade volume. The most active exchanges swapping BTCB today include Hitbtc, Pancakeswap v2, Thorchain, and Pancakeswap v1.There are also two other tokenized BTC projects operated by Blockstream and RSK. Today, RSK has 2,522 RBTC in circulation, which is also backed by 95 exahash per second (EH/s) of BTC hashpower.Blockstream’s federated sidechain, Liquid, has around 3,363.99 LBTC in circulation at the time of writing. RSK has around $124 million in tokenized bitcoin in circulation while Liquid’s LBTC value is $165.4 million.Liquid’s LBTC is only 0.77% of the aggregate tokenized BTC in circulation today across ten protocols. RBTC is even lower as its RBTC assets represent only 0.58% of the 434,265.43 aggregate. At the current trajectory of all the tokenized BTC projects today, there will soon be approximately half a million tokenized BTC leveraged on several alternative chains.What do you think about the 434K tokenized bitcoin in circulation today?

His firm’s clients include endowments, governments, foundations, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds.The Bridgewater boss was asked whether he thinks it is possible for the price of bitcoin to reach a very high number, such as $1 million. Dalio promptly replied:I don’t think that’s possible.“The way I look at it is there’s a certain amount of it [bitcoin] and there is a certain amount of gold,” he elaborated. “I’ll use gold as a benchmark,” he added, noting that the market cap of bitcoin is currently about $1 trillion and the market cap of the entire crypto market is about $2.2 trillion.“If you take the amount of money that is in gold that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks — and I assume bitcoin won’t be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes — that amount of gold is about $5 trillion,” he explained. “So right now if you were to have a portfolio that has gold and … bitcoin, it’s worth about 20% of the value of gold.”The billionaire emphasized that he does not think bitcoin will be worth more than gold. “I think that 20% sounds kind of about right,” he affirmed but admitted, “I really don’t know what the right answer is.”The Bridgewater founder concluded, “If you use gold as a measure, it just makes no sense that it’s going to be used that much more.” While admitting that he is “not sure about anything,” Dalio said:Logically it seems to me that there’s a limitation on its price in relationship to other things like it.Dalio previously revealed that he has a small amount of crypto in his portfolio for diversification. Regarding bitcoin, he said: “I think it’s very impressive that, for the last 10, 11 years, that programming has still held up. It hasn’t been hacked and so on, and it has an adoption rate.”Some people disagree with Dalio about how high the price of bitcoin could reach. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor, for example, expects the price of BTC to keep climbing against the dollar. The pro-bitcoin executive specifically mentioned that it could reach $600,000 and then $6 million a coin in the future.What do you think about Ray Dalio’s prediction and comments?

Calling fiat “fake money made of paper and lies,” he stressed that “central banks are printing more money than ever before.”Mexico’s third-richest billionaire, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, gave some advice Friday in a video he posted on Twitter to wish his followers happy holidays. Salinas is the founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas, a group of companies with interests in telecommunications, media, financial services, and retail stores. According to Forbes’ list of billionaires, his net worth is currently $13 billion.One of the three pieces of advice he gave concerns bitcoin and central banks. The billionaire said:Stay away from fiat money. The dollar, the euro, the yen, or the peso — they are all the same story. It’s fake money made of paper and lies. The central banks are printing more money than ever before. Invest in bitcoin.This was not the first time Salinas has advised people to buy bitcoin. In November, the billionaire tweeted “Buy bitcoin right now” citing that the U.S. is “looking more and more like any other irresponsible third world country.” He also posted a chart showing what he described as “the scale of fake money creation.”In June, he announced plans for his bank to accept BTC. “I recommend the use of bitcoin, and me and my bank are working to be the first bank in Mexico to accept bitcoin,” he tweeted. He also believes that “Bitcoin is the new gold,” noting that it is “much more portable.”In December, Salinas announced that his retail chain, Grupo Elektra, a leading retailer in Latin America, has started accepting bitcoin.Do you agree with Mexico’s third-richest billionaire about fiat money and bitcoin?

230,Colombian Real Estate Platform Allows Users to Acquire Property With Bitcoin,"Dec 27, 2021","A Colombian real estate platform is now allowing users to purchase properties with Bitcoin. The platform, called La Haus, is promoting bitcoin payments for a new real estate project in Santa Marta, called Natura City. This is an expansion of the platform, which has already established such a service in Mexico.A Colombian real estate platform, La Haus, is enabling bitcoin investors to buy real estate with the cryptocurrency directly. To kickstart this initiative in the country, the platform is featuring a new housing project in an exclusive part of Santa Marta, called Natura City. The location is less than 200 meters from the Colombian beaches and construction of the complex is estimated for completion by 2025.La Haus partnered with payment processor OpenNode for this task and allows users to pay for the properties via Lightning Network or on-chain, depending on the needs of the buyer. The buyer can pay 100% in bitcoin, or just pay a portion of the total in BTC, paying the remaining amount via traditional avenues. Each apartment is valued at approximately 2.19 bitcoin or 400 million Colombian Pesos.This is not the first time La Haus has been involved with cryptocurrency payments in the sector. Earlier this year, in November, the company started accepting bitcoin payments for a housing development on Playa del Carmen, Mexico. At that time, La Haus stated that its intention was to extend this payment option to all of the properties listed on its platform.On the evolution of accepting bitcoin payments, La Haus president and co-founder Rodrigo Sanchez-Rios, stated:We think that Bitcoin will be the reserve currency of the future. At our core, we’re a tech company. It’s natural for us to be pioneers with this technology.However, the issue of bitcoin as a payment method for real estate companies can be complex due to regulations. In the U.S., bitcoin can be considered property, so that any income or loss resulting from the sale of the asset is subject to capital gains tax. Real estate purchases in crypto continue, however, such as the purchase of an apartment in Venezuela with stablecoin tether.What do you think about La Haus accepting bitcoin payments for real estate in Colombia? Tell us in the comments section below.

231,"BTC Proxy Institutional Bitcoin DeFi Bridge to begin (3,3) Rebase Staking Jan 1, 2022","Dec 27, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. BTC Proxy (the institutional-grade Bitcoin DeFi bridge to both Polygon/Matic and Ethereum networks) has set the release date as January 1st, 2022 to launch its version of DeFi 2.0 Rebasing Rewards enabling stakers to earn 2500% + (3,3) APY alongside institutional participants.BTC Proxy’s founder (Donn Kim) originally announced the release date as November 19th, 2021 but was delayed due to technical/calculation issues and was further exacerbated by the 80M Ascendex Security Breach.The upcoming rebasing rewards program is a fork of the Olympus DAO but will take advantage of the scalability and cheaper fees on Polygon. The purpose of the development is to raise POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity) by selling Bonds intended to be paired with future institutional onboarding of BTC and to build a treasury to back the value of the $PRXY token.BTC Proxy’s primary use case is liberating the value of BTC held by long-term hodlers, whales, Investment Funds and the “MicroStrategy’s” of the world by wrapping Bitcoin into $BTCpx. The difference between other wrapped solutions is the use of insured custodians to create a safer holding environment which seems to be of even greater importance in the wake of so many security breaches.With the initial announcement of the Vesting and Development Update, the $PRXY token saw a significant price rally and heightened user awareness as the (3.3) community seemed to embrace its use case. 11-27 AMA with @takegreenpillStaking is set to start at 2500% APY with the potential to rise to 8000% and Bonding will begin with $USDC/wETH/BTCpx single assets.Bonding is the mechanism of minting new $PRXY tokens at a reduced market price by using $USDC/wETH/BTCpx with the potential to earn 5-30% ROI in return for a 5 day vesting period.What is BTC PRoxy BTC Proxy launched on July 30 2021, to provide a more scalable layer-two protocol to decentralize the tokenization of Bitcoin mainly for multi-national institutions. At its core, BTCpx is a Bitcoin bridge using insured multisig third-party custodians to facilitate the unlocking of an otherwise dormant BTC. With Proxy Finance liquidity mining and rebase staking programs, these BTC holders can now participate in a DeFi 2.0 protocol, to earn significantly higher yields.In other words, BTC Proxy has changed Bitcoin’s utility narrative by giving it access to the vastly expanding DeFi landscape. Bitcoin has been outside the DeFi blockchain world, but Proxy has brought these worlds together and “Bitcoin Maxies” can now take full advantage of DeFi 2.0 directly with Proxy Finance at prxy.fi.What’s in Store for 2022As Bitcoin’s price continues to bounce between $45000 and its All-Time High (ATH) price of $69,044.77. After a prolonged 5-month slump below $50,000, the bullish trend is anticipated to continue. A Bitcoin rally can bring a rising tide that will raise the market as well as many Altcoins.According to Donn Kim, “Once large funds and institutions have accumulated or mined BTC, it is usually moved into storage to be locked away and possibly put to work in a lending program, earning ~7.0 APY. We hope to crush that yield amount with double/triple digits” BTC Proxy’s value proposition of accessing that BTC to earn substantial yields with minimal risk and movement is a wise alternative to consider seriously.Recent News from Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s CEO, proves correct as big institutions are more readily considering alternative yielding strategies. The BTC Proxy team anticipates increased interest from similar Bitcoin Institutions in the new year.What’s Driving Value to the NetworkValue is added to BTC Proxy through its governance token $PRXY and with the participation of the network to increase circulation supply and liquidity. Participants are attracted to the high reward rates from staking and the short term ROIs from Bonding which builds the protocol’s treasury and the value backing the $PRXY token. This is a ground floor opportunity for participants to earn high yields through compounding rewards 3x daily and price appreciation of the token.Participants can easily track their rewards in the program within their wallet with Staked PRXY (sPRXY) pegged 1:1 to the $PRXY token, which rebases to track their staked balance. The program begins on Jan 1, 2022 at Proxy Finance prxy.fi This is a press release.

The bill will also propose creating a new entity to oversee the digital asset market.U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis is reportedly preparing to introduce a comprehensive crypto bill next year. The Republican senator from Wyoming explained that the bill will cover everything from how cryptocurrencies are taxed and categorized to consumer protections, Bloomberg reported Thursday.The bill will provide clear guidance on which asset class a particular asset belongs to and will also establish a framework to regulate stablecoins, a senior aide for the senator told the news outlet. In addition, it will propose creating a new entity to oversee the crypto market that will operate under the joint jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Lummis is a member of the Senate Banking Committee. She has repeatedly said that bitcoin is a great store of value. The senator recently confirmed that she owns about five bitcoins and has no plan to sell them. Her BTC is part of a broad portfolio that includes her family’s cattle ranches.In October, Lummis said in Congress: “Thank God for bitcoin, and other non-fiat currencies, that transcends the irresponsibility of governments, including our own.”Several bills have already been introduced in Congress with the intention of regulating the crypto sector. In August, U.S. Rep. Don Beyer introduced the “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.” The bill provides the SEC with authority over digital asset securities and the CFTC with authority over digital assets.In April, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill introduced by pro-bitcoin Congressman Patrick McHenry which requires the SEC and the CFTC “to establish a working group focused on digital assets.”In August, two U.S. lawmakers urged the chairman of the SEC and the acting chairman of the CFTC to establish a joint working group for the regulation of crypto assets. Other efforts to regulate the crypto industry include the “Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020 (DCEA)” and the “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020.”What do you think about Senator Lummis planning to introduce a comprehensive cryptocurrency bill?

235,"Bitcoin's Hashpower Remains High, Up 163% in 5 Months, Foundry USA Commands Top Mining Pool","Dec 23, 2021","The hashpower behind the Bitcoin network has continued to stay above the 180 exahash per second (EH/s) zone after recently reaching a lifetime high. Five months ago the hashrate tapped a low at 69 EH/s and since then, the hashpower has increased by 163% during the last 178 days, or five months ago.Miners dedicating SHA256 hashpower to the Bitcoin blockchain have been keeping the processing power above 180 EH/s. At the time of writing on December 23, BTC’s hashrate is hovering just above the 186 EH/s zone. The recent hashrate highs follow BTC’s lifetime hashrate high tapping 194.95 EH/s on December 8, 2021. Since then, metrics indicate that the hashrate has been hovering below that region and 30-day stats show a few times when the it quickly came close to the December 8 high.BTC’s hashrate is currently doing a whole lot better than records show on June 28, 2021, when the processing power plummeted to 69 EH/s. Thanks to the crackdowns on Chinese mining operations located in China, the network lost 63.87% of its hashpower from 191 EH/s on May 9, to the 69 EH/s at the end of June. Five months later, the hashrate has rebounded and regained the processing power lost during that time frame. At the end of June, BTC’s price was much lower, swapping for $34K per unit.This past week BTC has been trading at prices between $46.5K to $49.5K and this has kept the hashrate running strong — even after the network’s mining difficulty jumped 8.33% higher on December 11. In fact, the network difficulty may see a downward adjustment for the first time since the November 28 1.49% drop. At the time of writing, and over 24 hours from now, the difficulty is expected to drop again a hair, down 0.23%. This would bring the current 24.20 trillion mining difficulty down a notch to 24.14 trillion.Currently, the largest bitcoin (BTC) miner in terms of overall hashrate is Foundry USA with 17.17% of the global hashpower or 29.82 EH/s. The second-largest miner today is Bitmain’s Antpool with 14.78% of the global hashpower or 25.67 EH/s. Antpool is followed by Viabtc (14.57%), F2pool (13.26%), and Binance Pool (12.17%). Unknown hashrate or stealth miners command 12.17% of the network’s hashpower and are the sixth-largest entity in terms of global hashrate. The unknown hashrate at the time of writing has around 21.14 exahash per second of hashpower.What do you think about the current state of the proof-of-work (PoW)-powered Bitcoin network’s hashrate? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.

236,Report: Illegal Trades Account for Less Than 3% of Total Bitcoin Transactions,"Dec 23, 2021","According to a new report, illegal transactions, scams and gambling together make up less than 3% of the volume on the Bitcoin blockchain while exchanges and trading desks account for around 80% of volume. A new study called “Blockchain Analysis of the Bitcoin Market” has found that illegal transactions, scams, and gambling combined account for just 3% of all onchain bitcoin trade volume. On the other hand, the study asserts that exchange and trading desk-related volume — which is mostly speculative — constitutes about 80% of the total volume.In their analysis, the authors of a report released by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) appear to debunk the assertion that illegal transactions dominate bitcoin (BTC) trade volumes. In particular, the authors, Igor Makarov from the London School of Economics and Antoinette Schoar of the MIT Sloan School of Management, explain how earlier studies were likely to be overstating the economic value of illegal trades.To support their argument, the two authors point to a 2019 study that had concluded that more than 46% of BTC transactions are due to illegal transactions. The authors stated:First, Foley et al. (2019) intentionally drop all exchange-related volumes from their calculations, since they want to focus only on payments for goods and services. Since we show above that trading constitutes the main activity on the blockchain, this choice severely changes the denominator.In addition, the authors said the estimate of volume in the Foley study is based on what they termed an imputed network of illegal clusters where any cluster recursively is deemed illegal if the majority of its transactions are with previously identified illegal clusters.Although the two authors agree that this method is appealing, they nonetheless argue that this “does not discriminate between real users and short-lived pass-through clusters that exist solely to obfuscate tracing.”Unlike the method that was used in the 2019 study, Makarov and Schoar do incorporate exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, or trading desk data when computing the non-spurious BTC volumes. Consequently, in their analysis, the two authors conclude that exchange and trading desk-related volume constitutes about 80% of the total volume while other known entities are only responsible for a minor part of total volume as of the end of 2020.While Makarov and Schoar suggested in their report that they agreed with the general concern over the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin transactions, they however insisted that it is “important to get the magnitudes of transaction activities right in order to understand what are the ultimate drivers of bitcoin value.”Do you agree with this study’s conclusion about the size of illegal transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain?

241,Bitcoin's Bearish Prices at the End of 2021 Not Much Different Than 8 Previous Year-End Cycles,"Dec 20, 2021","The price of bitcoin is down more than 33% from the crypto asset’s all-time high captured about a month ago on November 10. A while back, people expected the price of bitcoin to be extremely bullish during the months of November and December, and many expected a $100K bitcoin price by the year’s end. However, during the last 13 years, more so than not, bitcoin prices are typically bearish in the last two months of the year.There have been a few occasions when BTC had a monumental November and December run in terms of price gains. This year has not been so bullish and people don’t realize that for most of bitcoin’s life, these months have been bearish a majority of the time. For instance, after bitcoin started seeing real-world value and a USD exchange rate in September through November 2010, after November 10, just like this year, BTC’s price slid from a high of $0.35 per unit to $0.17 by December 10, 2010. That’s a 51.42% loss in bitcoin’s fiat value over 30 days over 11 years ago.In 2011, BTC had a decent bull run jumping from $2 per unit in mid-November that year to $6 by the year’s end, or a 200% increase in USD value. In 2012, bitcoin (BTC) meandered between $10 and $13.50 during the months of November and December. The price had already tapped $13.50 per coin in August and remained lackluster until January 2013. In 2013 during the months of November and December, BTC’s price was once again bullish. In mid-December 2013, BTC’s price came awfully close to $1,200 per coin.The months of November and December 2014 were bearish as BTC slipped from $471 per coin in mid-September to just above $300 per coin by mid-December 2014. The price of BTC lost 33.12% during that period of time in 2014. The price of BTC in 2015 was again bearish during the two months and in 2016 the price was bullish in November and December. 2017 was a bullish time for BTC during those two months, as the price came very close to $20K per unit.The following year, during the first week of November 2018, BTC’s price was bearish and valued at $6,376 per unit. By the first week of December 2018, the price was $4,139 per BTC. It’s safe to say that those two months were bearish and by the year’s end BTC was trading for $3,865 per unit. In 2019, around October, BTC was swapping for $9,223 per BTC and on November 4, 2019, it was trading for $9,424 per coin. Ten days later BTC was swapping for $8,639.18 and by December 23, 2019, bitcoin was exchanging hands for $7,324 per unit. The last two months of 2019 were definitely bearish in terms of price movement.The end of 2020 was decent for bitcoin (BTC) prices and by October 13, 2020, bitcoin’s value was $11,425 per coin. Ten days later the price was $12,931 and by the end of 2020 on December 23, BTC was swapping hands for $23,241 per unit. The data clearly shows that November and December 2020 were considered a bullish two months for bitcoin (BTC). Of course, we all know what happened in 2021, and the new bitcoin price highs that were recorded this year.Despite BTC being 33% below the crypto asset’s all-time high of $69K per unit, it is still 90% above the price it held this time last year. However, bitcoin’s (BTC) price sentiment in November and December 2021 has been bearish and in a continuous downtrend. Bitcoin advocates will have to wait and see how the rest of December 2021 plays out and if it miraculously changes from bearish to bullish by then, or by the first month of 2022.If the last two months of the first year of bitcoin (2009, with no real-world prices) are considered bearish, and 2021’s November and December are also deemed bearish, then only 5 out of the 13 years of bitcoin’s existence have seen the November and December time interval as bullish for BTC.What do you think about bitcoin’s price during the last two months of every year? Would you consider 2021’s November and December bearish? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

242,"Crypto Economy Loses 3% Overnight, Bitcoin Slides Below $46K, Analyst Says 'Downward Force Still Strong'","Dec 20, 2021","The crypto economy has slid in value 2.9% during the last 24 hours and bitcoin slipped under the $46K price zone on Monday. Furthermore, the top ten digital currencies have lost anywhere between 3% to 7% in value during the last day following bitcoin’s price slide. The price of bitcoin (BTC) is down 3.7% today and trading for $45,738 per unit at the time of writing. While year-to-date, bitcoin is up more than 90% in value, during the last 30 days BTC shed 21.8%. Currently, BTC has a market valuation of around $864 billion which represents 38.6% of the $2.24 trillion crypto economy.The second-largest crypto asset in terms of market valuation is ethereum (ETH) and it has slid 4.4% during the last 24 hours and 8.7% during the last day. At the time of writing, ether is exchanging hands for $3,787 per unit. Ethereum’s dominance today among the rest of the coins in the $2.24 trillion crypto economy is 20%. On Monday, ETH has an overall market valuation of $448.8 billion.Four tokens managed to gather gains during the last 24 hours which include yearn finance (YFI) up 6.5%, olympus (OHM) up 3%, okb (OKB) up 2.8%, and leo token (LEO) up 2.1%. The biggest losers on Monday include curve dao token (CRV) down 10%, compound (COMP) down 10.5%, and waves (WAVES) down 10.2%. Out of the 11,836 crypto coins today traded on 533 exchanges worldwide, there’s $102.8 billion in global trade volume.Speaking with Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi Group, Jun says that bitcoin began to fall again after jumping above the $48K region this past weekend. “According to data from Huobi Global, BTC began to fall after reaching a high of 48,300 on weekends,” Jun told our newsdesk. “It is now around 46,000 and the downward trend is relatively stable. It is likely to further break through the 45,500 pressure level. From 4h K-lines, the price is still in a stable downward channel. DIF crossed DEA and formed a downward signal.“The K-line ran near the lower rail of the Bollinger Bands, and the trading volume was relatively sluggish,” the Huobi Group executive said. “At the daily level, price fluctuations have gradually slowed down in recent days, and price fluctuations were temporarily controllable. In short term, pay attention to the downward momentum and the breakthrough of the 45500 position below.”Jun further added:[Ethereum] declined steadily during daytime, falling from a high of 3980 to a low of 3760, and is now near 3780. Judging from the 4h k-line, the k-line fluctuated greatly today, which changed the stability of the past days. However, it is not difficult to see from the daily line that the drop is to pull the k-line back into the downward channel, indicating that the downward force is still relatively strong. In short term, pay attention to extent of the price drop.What do you think about the recent price drops across the crypto economy and Huobi Group’s bitcoin and ethereum outlook?

244,Hundreds of Millions Worth of 'Sleeping Bitcoins' Woke up After BTC's Mid-November Price High,"Dec 19, 2021","On Sunday, December 19, a dormant address that received 235 bitcoin in 2013 was activated after more than nine years of sitting idle. Bitcoin’s price has dropped lower after reaching its all-time high on November 10, and throughout December, records show a great number of so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ have activated during this period.The day that bitcoin (BTC) tapped an all-time price high at $69K per unit on November 10, a miner from 2010 spent 1,000 sleeping bitcoins and 1,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) as well. The 1,000 bitcoins stemmed from 20 block rewards mined well over a decade ago in 2010. This same entity spent another 1,000 BTC and 1,000 BCH the following day. Additionally, a single block from 2010, worth 50 BTC or $2.3 million was spent on November 3.During the month of November, a total of 11 block rewards that were ten years old and mined in 2011, were activated and sent to new BTC addresses. That’s a total of 550 BTC worth $25.8 million using today’s bitcoin exchange rates. So far, for the month of December 2021, a total of four 2011 block rewards with 200 BTC worth $9.3 million was activated. There haven’t been any 2010 block rewards spent but seven blocks from 2012 were activated, 14 blocks from 2013, and five blocks from 2014.Today, a dormant address from 2013 that originally had 235 bitcoin activated for the first time in 9.1 years by spending 100 BTC. *The address still has 135.80 BTC and Blockchair’s privacy-o-meter explains the transaction was sent with 0 privacy score and had “critical” privacy concerns. One transaction vulnerability seen in the transaction was “matched addresses identified.” On Thursday, December 16, a dormant address containing 225 bitcoin was activated after 8.4 years. The address spent approximately 25 BTC worth $1.1 million and still holds 200 BTC. Both of these whale addresses did not spend the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoinsv (BSV).On November 22, a dormant address that had 187 bitcoin sitting ide for eight years, moved 13 BTC and kept 174.43 BTC sitting idle in the wallet. The wallet’s corresponding BCH and BSV still hold 187 coins each and were not spent. Two days prior, another wallet with sleeping bitcoins that sat for 8.1 years was activated on November 20. The whale address spent a whopping 1,299.98 BTC that day worth $61 million today but it did not spend the 1,299 BCH and BSV.Two more idle addresses with old bitcoins were activated during the month of November on the 10th and 11th. On November 11, an address with 234 BTC was activated after 7.5 years and unloaded 53.16 BTC that day. The day before, when BTC tapped $69K per unit and the mystery whale spent 1,000 BTC from 2010, a dormant address from 2013 or 8.1 years ago was activated. The address moved 2,207.60 BTC or $103.7 million worth of bitcoin using today’s exchange rates.Whatever the case may be, the owners of very old bitcoin wallets decided to transfer their coins for the first time in many years. It’s worth noting that the terms “spent” or “spend” in this article, do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party for fiat or another crypto asset.The so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ could have been sold or could have been merely transferred to different wallets. Lots of these wallets see coins move from legacy bitcoin addresses to addresses that support Segregated Witness (Segwit) addresses (Bech32). Although, most of the popular crypto exchanges worldwide support Bech32 addresses and many of these coins very well could have been sold for fiat.* Editors Note: After this article published, the dormant address with 235 BTC from 2013 sent the wallet’s entire stash and the wallet is now completely empty. (12/19/21 6:00 p.m. EST). What do you think about all the old wallets waking up after many years of sitting dormant in November and December 2021? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

246,Cornell Professor of Economics: Defi Promise Is Real but Bitcoin May Not Last Much Longer,"Dec 17, 2021","A Cornell University economics professor says that the promise of decentralized finance (defi) using blockchain technology is real but bitcoin may not last that much longer. Nonetheless, he admitted bitcoin “has really set off a revolution that ultimately might benefit all of us either directly or indirectly.”Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University, talked about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, decentralized finance (defi), and central bank digital currencies in a recent interview with CNBC, published Friday.Prasad, the author of “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution is Transforming Currencies and Finance,” is the Nandlal P. Tolani senior professor of trade policy and professor of economics at the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. He previously served as chief of the financial studies division in the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s research department and head of the IMF’s China division.Noting that blockchain technology will be “fundamentally transformative” in finance and in the way we conduct our day-to-day transactions, he opined:The promise of decentralized finance using blockchain technology is a real one but bitcoin itself may not last that much longer.The professor of economics explained: “Bitcoin’s use of the blockchain technology is not very efficient. It uses a validation mechanism for transactions that is environmentally destructive that doesn’t scale up very well.”He asserted that there are newer cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology far more efficiently than bitcoin does.“With any assets, the question is where is the fundamental value proposition,” he continued, adding:Given that bitcoin is not serving well as a medium of exchange, I don’t think it’s going to have any fundamental value other than whatever investor’s faith leads it to have.He proceeded to discuss currency competition and stablecoins. “There is an interesting element of currency competition that it has set off. There are stablecoins now that could, in principle, create more effective ways of transacting in basic ways,” he described.The professor added that cryptocurrencies have “lit a fire under central banks to start thinking about issuing digital versions of their own currencies.”Professor Prasad explained that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) “could be good in many ways in terms of providing an additional payment option, a low cost payment option that everybody has access to, increasing financial inclusion, and potentially also increasing financial stability.”He concluded:Much as you might not like bitcoin, it has really set off a revolution that ultimately might benefit all of us either directly or indirectly.Do you agree with Professor Eswar Prasad?

247,"Canaan Secures Order for 30,000 Bitcoin Mining Rigs From Genesis Digital Assets","Dec 17, 2021","The application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rig manufacturer Canaan has announced the company has secured a follow-on contract from Genesis Digital Assets for 30,000 mining machines. The sale is part of an agreement between Canaan and Genesis that gives the mining operation the option to purchase up to 180,000 ASIC bitcoin mining rigs.At the end of August, Genesis Digital Assets purchased 20,000 of Canaan’s top ASIC bitcoin mining rigs and explained that it had the option to buy 180K more. Following the announcement, Genesis raised $431 million from strategic investors at the end of September, and the following week it revealed a new data center in Texas. Now Genesis is following up on its deal with Canaan and has inked a follow-on contract with the mining rig manufacturer for 30,000 more ASIC miners.Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, the co-founder and executive chairman of Genesis, explained the 30,000 mining rigs will bolster the company’s operations. “This most recent order of machines will support our efforts to rapidly scale our operations as we work towards our goal of increasing our capacity to 1.9 gigawatts by the end of 2023,” Mirakhmedov said.The option agreement for 180K ASIC miners is considered one of the “mining industry’s largest mining machine deal to date,” according to the two firms. “The option agreement entails three phases, with mining machines amounting to 30,000, 60,000, and 90,000 units to be purchased respectively. The acquired machines from the first phase of the contract are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022,” Canaan said.The mining rig manufacturer’s top device is the Avalonminer 1246 that was released last January. The Avalonminer 1246 model produces around 90 terahash per second (TH/s) and pulls 3,420 watts off the wall. Canaan’s machine, at $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and today’s bitcoin exchange rate, would produce roughly $15 a day in profit, according to asicminervalue.com metrics.The secondary sale prices for the Avalonminer 1246 are around $7,000 to $9,000 per device, while Canaan’s website doesn’t show a price for the unit. Canaan’s shares listed on Nasdaq were trading for $5.93 on December 30, 2020, and today shares exchange hands for $5.42, or 8.6% lower. On March 11, 2021, the firm’s stock tapped a high of $36.40, and at $5.42 shares are 85.10% lower than the 2021 price high.What do you think about Genesis ordering 30,000 Canaan miners and the option to purchase more?

249,"Global Markets, Bitcoin Defy Expectations After Fed's Hawkish Taper Plan Announcement","Dec 16, 2021","Global markets have defied predictions as the U.S. Federal Reserve and several central banks worldwide are prepping to slow down monetary easing policy. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said it plans to taper quantitative easing (large monthly asset purchases) and end the program by March 2022. Moreover, the FOMC members decided to keep interest rates at zero but expect at least three rate hikes next year.Since the onset of Covid-19 in the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve initiated a monetary easing policy like no other in history. The move has led to a surge in inflation and analysts and economists worldwide have criticized the Fed’s decisions in recent times. The FOMC concluded a two-day meeting on Wednesday and the central bank explained that it plans to shrink its bond purchase program to $30 billion per month by January. This month the Fed will leverage $90 billion in quantitative easing (QE) purchases as opposed to last month’s $120 billion.In addition to the tapering of QE, the FOMC members also detailed that the central bank has plans for three rate hikes next year. It expects three in 2022, two more rate hikes in 2023, and another two interest rate increases in 2024. The Fed did not, however, blame the rising inflation in the U.S. on its QE but instead noted that the inflation was caused by issues with supply and demand.“Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation,” the FOMC said on Wednesday. Furthermore, the FOMC statements said Covid-19, and new coronavirus variants, have affected the U.S. economy a great deal.Despite the taper statements and disclosing that there will likely be three rate hikes next year, the Fed’s comments saw a market reaction opposite to what was predicted before the taper announcement. Nasdaq, NYSE, and the Dow Jones all saw gains after the FOMC meeting concluded. Speaking with Bitcoin.com News, Alex Kuptsikevich, the Fxpro senior market analyst, said the Fed “held the most hawkish edge of market expectations” on Wednesday.“The FOMC announced that it would double the pace of tapering,” Kuptsikevich said. “The committee’s updated forecasts suggest three key rate hikes in 2022, although only six months ago, it expected none. We also heard that the balance of the Fed’s targets allows a rate hike to begin before achieving full employment due to higher inflation.”“The Fed chairman also called financial asset valuations ‘elevated,’” the market analyst continued. “This is a clear signal of a willingness to hurt the markets, as he did in 2018. During the press conference, Powell noted that FOMC did not yet have a consensus on the timing of the Fed’s balance sheet cut. In the previous stimulus wind-down cycle, this was not an actual issue long after the start of the rate hike — The dollar index rallied within the first minutes after the FOMC, touching the highs from July 2020, but then it turned back down, losing 0.8% from the peak at the time of writing.”Kuptsikevich added:The feeling is that the markets have prepared for a risk-on, expecting softness from the Fed, and have not backed down despite the Fed’s rhetoric. Some commentators believe we saw a classical ‘buy rumours, sell facts’ reaction. However, the rise in ‘growth’ stocks speaks more about the market mood to end a strong year on a cheerful note. At the same time on the dollar, a wave of profit-taking growth in the last six months seems to have started, although the Fed’s stance is much more hawkish compared to other central banks from the DXY basket.Even bitcoin (BTC) defied expectations on Wednesday, as the price kicked up a notch after the FOMC’s hawkish plans were announced. Just before the meeting ended, BTC was exchanging hands for $46,590 per unit and after the FOMC meeting came to a conclusion, BTC prices jumped to a $49,420 high on Wednesday afternoon (EST).In addition to the FOMC meeting, the Bank of England (BoE) kicked up its benchmark rate to 0.25% from 0.1%. No other central banks have done this yet and the European Central Bank, like the Federal Reserve, kept its benchmark interest rate suppressed for now.The European Central Bank explained that it will not raise borrowing rates until inflation settles. In addition, the U.S. weekly jobless claims published by the Labor Department indicate a rise last week. The Labor Department’s report shows jobless claims are still well above pre-pandemic levels.What do you think about the Federal Reserve’s taper process and discussions about raising the benchmark rate three times in 2022? What do you think about the Bank of England raising its benchmark rate for the first time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

250,"Court Decision Voids Crypto Mining Contracts in China, Shuts Down Bitcoin Farms","Dec 16, 2021","A court in Beijing has ruled that three investment agreements for bitcoin mining operations in Sichuan are “invalid.” A compensation claim has been rejected in the case, viewed as an indication that the Chinese judiciary would not provide protection for crypto-related interests. The Chaoyang District People’s Court in the Chinese capital has recently rejected a lawsuit seeking damages from a crypto company. It was filed by one of its clients who failed to make a return on his investments in bitcoin mining, the Hong Kong daily South China Morning Post reported, quoting state-run media in the mainland.Beijing Phonf Marketing Technology, the plaintiff, entered into three agreements with Zyzc Blockchain Technology in May 2019 for the deployment of mining hardware in Sichuan, paying 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) for the job. At the time, the central government was still tolerant of crypto mining, while some local authorities, including in this province, allowed bitcoin farms to utilize surplus hydropower.China banned crypto-related activities such as trading back in 2017 but the government did not interfere with mining until this spring. In May, the State Council decided to clamp down on the industry following President Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality in the next four decades. The government offensive has since spread to provinces like Sichuan.In its plea, Beijing Phonf revealed that it had earned 18.35 BTC, worth around $904,000 at the time of writing but less in previous periods, and demanded that the firm it worked with pay another 278.17 BTC in compensation. In the first case of this kind, as per the report, the court has determined that the mining contracts are invalid. The newspaper remarks that the decision suggests the Chinese judicial system does not intend to recognize or protect interests related to cryptocurrencies.Following the rejection of the lawsuit, the Chaoyang District Court notified the provincial branch of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in Sichuan. Officials at the economic planner took steps to shut down the remaining mining facilities involved in the case and targeted other coin minting projects.Inspections to identify illegal mining activities have been carried out elsewhere as well. Authorities in Zhejiang, for example, recently raided almost two dozen government-run organizations, including universities, and established that 14 of them were mining crypto.Besides Sichuan and Zhejiang, this year’s government crackdown on the mining sector has affected a number of provinces such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, Anhui, and Hebei. In November, the NDRC also announced it’s going after state-run industrial enterprises involved in the extraction of digital currencies.Do you think this decision of the court in Beijing will determine how the Chinese judiciary will treat similar cases in the future?

251,"Ukrainians Offered New Crypto Services, Bitcoin Cards","Dec 16, 2021","Along with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, Ukrainians are enjoying an expanding range of related services and products. Besides new options to buy and trade coins, crypto users in the country will be offered two cards that will allow them to spend their digital currencies in stores and online. U.K.-based crypto payment processor Wirex has allowed residents of Ukraine to purchase and exchange cryptocurrencies on its platform. The company supports more than 20 cryptocurrencies, including major coins such as BTC and ETH as well as popular altcoins like DOGE.Ukrainians will also be able to open crypto savings accounts based on defi products, Wirex told Forklog this week. These will return up to 16% compound interest on selected currencies annually, the provider explained, noting that the interest can also be credited in the native WXT currency.Wirex also plans to issue its card to Ukrainian crypto holders giving them the opportunity to spend their coins on goods and services offered by local merchants that do not directly accept cryptocurrency. This will be possible through instant conversion to hryvnia. Ukrainians will also receive a virtual card they can add to Apple Pay and Google Pay.The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has turned Ukraine into a leader in adoption while authorities in Kyiv have been taking steps to regulate the crypto space. According to Wirex CTO Ruslan Kolodyazhny, the company has long planned to enter the Ukrainian market as it considers it promising.The British fintech obtained a license from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority more than three years ago. Since then, its services have enjoyed a growing consumer interest. Over 4 million people in 130 countries now use its Mastercard and Visa cards.Ukrainians may expect similar products from domestic payment providers as well. Last month, the Ukrainian online banking platform Monobank announced it’s ready to release its own cryptocurrency card. The company complained it had been waiting for more than three months to get an approval from the National Bank of Ukraine.In October, the head of the monetary authority, Kirill Shevchenko, revealed that the central bank had been approached by commercial banks seeking permission to issue cards linked to crypto wallets. He stressed, however, that the regulator remains concerned over the risks associated with such transactions and certain challenges with financial monitoring.Ukraine is yet to comprehensively regulate its crypto market. Ukrainian parliament adopted the long-awaited law “On Virtual Assets” in early September when lawmakers approved the bill on second and final reading. The legislation passed its first reading last December, after which it was revised and presented again in the Verkhovna Rada in June of this year. However, in early October, President Volodymyr Zelensky returned the law and requested further changes.Do you expect Ukrainian regulators to soften their stance on crypto-related products and services? Tell us in the comments section below.

253,"Game Developer Moonray PBC Raises $3.5 Million, Aims to Bring NFT and Blockchain Gaming to Bitcoin","Dec 15, 2021","On December 14, Moonray PBC, the developer behind the multiplayer action-role-playing game (RPG) Moonray, announced that the project has raised $3.5 million from strategic investors. Moonray is considered the first metaverse and gaming non-fungible token (NFT) exchange built on the Bitcoin network via Stacks.Play-to-earn (P2E) games, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the metaverse have become very popular in recent times. There’s been a massive amount of funding directed at projects developing video games and new ventures being launched by big-name game makers. A report published in mid-November shows that game developers are starting to incorporate blockchain tech into games more frequently. On Tuesday, the startup Moonray PBC announced that the team has raised $3.5 million in a funding round led by Animoca Brands.The funds will be dedicated toward scaling the Moonray multiplayer action-RPG, an NFT marketplace, and in-game economy. In addition to Animoca Brands, investors such as LD Capital, Lucid Blue Ventures, GBV Capital, and Metavest Capital joined the Moonray financing round. Unlike the myriad of blockchain games built on networks like Ethereum and Solana, Moonray is built using the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol through Stacks. “Stacks is an open-source blockchain network that leverages the security and capital of Bitcoin for decentralized apps and smart contracts,” the Stacks website explains.According to Rodrigo Etcheto, CEO of Moonray PBC, bitcoin (BTC) will be an integral part of the Moonray gaming ecosystem, with the ability to earn bitcoin yield and Lightning Network integration. “Building a game in the metaverse is more than just putting something in VR or AR, there has to be an economy where players can have a real financial stake in the things they own,” Etcheto said in a statement on Tuesday. “Players have found roundabout ways to trade digital items in the past and we are trying to make it easier for players to exchange and sell items with one another.”The Moonray PBC executive added:When our marketplace is fully-operational we will feature Lightning Network integration, [bitcoin] payments, and NFTs that have the ability to earn [bitcoin] yield.The game Moonray and the Moonray NFT marketplace aim to launch with select players around March 2022, according to the funding announcement. The funding from Animoca Brands follows Animoca’s partnership with the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Animoca Brands and BAYC’s creators, Yuga Labs, plan to launch a play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain game based on BAYC NFTs next year as well. Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, believes blockchain games are transforming the industry and that Moonray will be part of the shift.“Blockchain games are evolving rapidly. Moonray is at the vanguard of this change, building a far-future RPG experience that will be unlike anything that most players have ever seen on blockchain,” Siu opined in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “We are very excited by the potential that Moonray is demonstrating as it builds this ambitious multiplayer AAA experience.”What do you think about Moonray PBC raising $3.5 million from investors like Animoca Brands and Lucid Blue Ventures?

254,"Multicoin Capital Exec Says There 'May Not Be a Crypto Bear Market at All,' Claims 'Bitcoin Will Get Flipped'","Dec 14, 2021","While the crypto economy has tumbled in value during the last two weeks, the managing partner at Multicoin Capital, Kyle Samani, recently shared his views on why he thinks the “next bear market will not be like the last one.” In fact, Samani remarks that there may not even be “a bear market at all.”One thing is for sure, cryptocurrency investors are fearful of a full-on bear market like the past two crypto winters that shaved digital currency prices by more than 80% in value after each top. Currently, anywhere between 25% to 30% of the value since the crypto price highs on November 10, have been lost and bearish sentiment has put pressure on the crypto economy as a whole. However, despite the 30% drawdown in market values, Multicoin Capital’s managing partner Kyle Samani shared his thoughts in a recent Twitter thread published two days ago.“Why the next bear market will not be like the last one,” Samani said. “And in fact, we may not have a bear market at all. Or we may have half a bear market, depending on your perspective.” Samani further says that broadly speaking, there are two types of people in crypto: “money crypto” and “tech crypto.” In recent times, or since 2017, Samani claims that the tech crypto group has dominated. “Since 2017, tech crypto has come to dominate the zeitgeist,” Samani stressed.Samani remarked that these days, it is clearly evident that tech crypto dominates and he says “there are still lots of people who just think about BTC as an inflation hedge, but they represent an increasingly small [percentage] of press, social media, conference speaking, etc.” The Multicoin Capital executive added:Money crypto people think primarily about interest rates, the politicization of central banks, etc. Tech people care about building. Inevitably, politicians/CBs will do stuff that is bad for BTC as an inflation hedge. Whether that’s banning it (or trying to), or just raising rates, or whatever. There is a natural ebb and flow to the actions of these institutions, and BTC-USD will naturally respond to it.Samani further stated that tech people don’t care about those types of things and that “they just want to build cool new things.” If bitcoin dropped by 50% because of government enforcements, Samani claims tech people will continue to build and investors will “invest in tech crypto.”“It’s possible that crypto is still a few years too early from truly breaking into the mainstream,” Samani noted on Sunday. “But I think at this point, that no longer matters. The train has left the station: all of the tech builders and investors have underwritten tech crypto as having a meaningful probability of reshaping commerce, finance, and the fabric of society at large. And they are comfortable meeting on that and holding for years,” the Multicoin Capital executive said.Samani insists that there is a vast amount of capital out there that “will never believe in BTC because they don’t believe in owning non-productive assets.” The crypto advocate believes that if there is a bear market, he expects solana (SOL) and ethereum (ETH) to outperform bitcoin (BTC) significantly. “The tech money doesn’t care about macro,” Samani opined. “They just want to be long [on] the stuff that they think is going to change the world.”Because “everyone knows that software is eating the world,” Samani predicts SOL and ETH demand will rise. He highlighted that everyone wants to be a part of the “next big tech wave, and crypto is credibly one of those waves.” The managing partner at Multicoin Capital further added that he believes “BTC will get flipped in the medium term.” He thinks as a tidal wave of tech money comes into the crypto economy, that it will crowd out the macro money group of people. Samani added:Once BTC is flipped, it’s pretty much game over for BTC. A large part of the value prop of BTC is that it’s the largest and most liquid. Once those stop being true, it has even less to offer. As people recognize that this is becoming true, a lot of the money in BTC will rotate out and into SOL and ETH and other more productive names.Following those statements, Samani surmised his theory by adding that the next bear market will not look like the last and stressed that the “decoupling is real.” “When BTC gets flipped, things get *really* interesting,” the Multicoin Capital executive concluded.What do you think about the Multicoin Capital executive Kyle Samani’s opinions about the bear market and certain cryptos outperforming bitcoin?

255,Actress Gwyneth Paltrow Invests in Bitcoin Mining Operation Terawulf,"Dec 14, 2021","The American actress and businesswoman Gwyneth Paltrow has participated in an investment round involving the bitcoin mining operation Terawulf. According to reports, Paltrow and a group of investors made a “substantial, 8-digit equity investment” in the company. Paltrow is well known for her involvement with cryptocurrencies and joined the crypto firm Abra in 2017 as an advisor.On December 13, Terawulf CEO Paul Prager tweeted about Gwyneth Paltrow investing in his bitcoin mining operation. “Thrilled for Gwyneth Paltrow, among others, to invest in Terawulf and support our team of energy entrepreneurs’ new paradigm for best-in-class [crypto mining] that uses 100% zero-carbon energy,” Prager said. Furthermore, reports disclose that investors like Paltrow and the Iranian-American CEO of Beautycon Media, Moj Mahdara, “made a substantial, 8-digit equity investment in Terawulf.”Seeking Alpha’s Joshua Fineman explains that Terawulf is in the midst of a reverse merger with a firm called Ikonics (NASDAQ: IKNX). The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger will change the publicly listed ticker to “WULF.” A number of crypto firms have leveraged the SPAC method to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) in order to acquire an existing company. For instance, the vertically integrated bitcoin self-mining company Griid revealed at the end of November its plans for a public listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) via a SPAC deal.The investment in Terawulf is not Gwyneth Paltrow’s first foray into the crypto industry as she’s been involved with crypto assets in the past. During the first week of August 2017, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt announced that Paltrow joined the company as an advisor. “She has been a huge value add,” Barhydt said of Paltrow at the time. “She’s opened up her network to us, given us valuable business advice,” Barhydt added.Paltrow’s “conversation-changing lifestyle brand” called Goop and the news publication Goop.com recently published an article at the end of August on “how to understand—and invest—in cryptocurrency. Paltrow discussed the subject with the entrepreneur and cryptocurrency expert Sophie Wiberg Holm. The American actress and Wiberg Holm conversed about “the rapidly changing landscape of digital currency, how NFTs work, and the long-term upsides of investing in cryptocurrency.”What do you think about Gwyneth Paltrow investing in the bitcoin mining company Terawulf?

256,"Elon Musk Says Bitcoin Suitable for Store of Value, Dogecoin for Transactions as Time Names Him Person of the Year","Dec 13, 2021","Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has been named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year, says bitcoin is suitable as a store of value while the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin is more suitable for transactions. “Even though it’s created as a silly joke, dogecoin is better suited for transactions,” Musk said.Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has been named Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year” for 2021. During an interview with the magazine, published Monday, Musk talked about cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and dogecoin (DOGE).“For nearly a century, Time has named a Person of the Year — the individual or group who most shaped the previous 12 months, for better or for worse,” CEO Edward Felsenthal explained. “Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too,” he added. Musk’s net worth is more than $300 billion.“I played a significant role in creating Paypal so my understanding of the money system at a fundamental level, how it actually works, the detailed mechanics of it — I think there’re very few people that understand it better than me,” Musk began.The Tesla CEO then suggested that bitcoin is unsuitable for payments. “The transaction volume of bitcoin is low and the cost per transaction is high,” he said, emphasizing:It is, at least at its base level, suitable for maybe a store of value.While reiterating that “Fundamentally, bitcoin is not a good substitute for transactional currency,” Musk proceeded to talk about dogecoin (DOGE).The Tesla boss has long been a proponent of the meme cryptocurrency. He is even known in the crypto community as the Dogefather. He previously revealed that he personally owns dogecoin, bitcoin, and ether. His companies – Tesla and Spacex – however only own bitcoin.The Tesla technoking said in the interview with Time Magazine:Even though it’s created as a silly joke, dogecoin is better suited for transactions.The CEO of Tesla and Spacex continued to explain about dogecoin. “It is slightly inflationary but that inflationary number is a fixed number as opposed to a percentage,” he described. “That means over time its percentage inflation actually decreases and that’s actually good because it encourages people to spend rather than sort of hoard it as a store of value.”Musk previously explained that he sees DOGE as the people’s crypto and everyone he talks to at Tesla owns dogecoin. In August, he agreed with Shark Tank star Mark Cuban, the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, that “The community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.”Do you agree with Elon Musk about bitcoin and dogecoin? What do you think about him being Time Magazine’s Person of the Year? Let us know in the comments section below.

257,"90% of Bitcoin's Supply Cap Has Been Issued, Miners Have 119 Years Left to Mine BTC","Dec 13, 2021","On December 12, crypto advocates celebrated the fact that 90% of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined into circulation. Currently, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum is around 1.88%, which is lower than the central banks’ traditional 2% target reference. Furthermore, in 875 days, the network’s inflation rate is expected to drop to 1.1% after 19.98 million bitcoins have been mined.One benefit people enjoy about the Bitcoin network is that it is mathematical and predictable, in comparison to monetary systems issued by central banks worldwide, which are based on the whims of policymakers and are completely unpredictable. At the time of writing, 18,899,800 BTC has been mined into circulation and that equates to roughly 90% of the 21 million BTC that will ever exist. Digital currency fans acknowledged this milestone on Sunday, December 12, the same day as the 11th anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto’s official departure.The 90% statistic can be seen on data sites like coinmarketcap.com, and Glassnode’s percentage of the bitcoin supply currently mined. The 90% of bitcoins mined into existence discussion on Reddit also led to people asking how many bitcoins are lost and stuck in unrecoverable wallets. While Bitcoin.com News recently shared a Coin Metrics 2019 report on the state of lost bitcoins, which said at least 1.5 million BTC was assumed to be lost, some Redditors estimate the number to be a whole lot more.“Estimates of 3-5 million [bitcoin] are out there,” one Redditor explained on Sunday. “You can see onchain metrics showing how much bitcoin hasn’t moved [in the] last decade but that would be the highest possible and there are some that just haven’t moved even though they possess the keys. I believe it’s around 3 [million], but we will very likely never know and it will continue to slightly go up. We also have a delay factor in the data because people within 10 years may have lost as well. It’s just assumed [for the] first couple of years [the] biggest losses occurred so we key in on that data.”While we don’t have a hard number of how many bitcoins are officially unrecoverable or lost, it’s far different than the predictability of BTC issuance. Satoshi believed and many crypto advocates believe that lost coins simply add to the crypto asset’s scarcity. “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more,” Bitcoin’s inventor said. “Think of it as a donation to everyone.” With 90% of the coins in existence circulating, and the current rate of 900 BTC per day, and 210,000 blocks every halving, the next reward halving is expected to happen on May 6, 2024.Right now, the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block and the rewards will decrease to 3.125 bitcoins per block post-halving. With the current Bitcoin inflation rate fluctuating between 1.75% to 1.88%, we can estimate that after the halving Bitcoin’s inflation rate will be around 1.1%. The Bitcoin protocol halves continuously every 210,000 blocks until it reaches 0, which is estimated to be around the year 2140. By then (the year 2140), it is expected that miners will continue securing the network and processing transactions based on network transfer fees.There’s a total of two more significantly sized bitcoin block reward halvings expected up until around 2030, and the halvings that follow after that year will be fractions of BTC. By 2028, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum is expected to be around 0.5% and by 2030 it will be around 0.4% with 20,585,442 million bitcoins in circulation. By 2030 estimates indicate that 98.02% of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist will be mined.With Bitcoin’s hashrate climbing to all-time highs, the time frames of exactly when these changes will occur are fairly good approximations, but not set in stone. Currently, network participants (miners) dedicating hashrate to the BTC network have accelerated the time frame between halvings, and the daily issuance rate has been faster than previously surmised estimations.What do you think about the fact that 90% of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined into circulation? What do you think about Bitcoin’s programmatic scarcity and predictable issuance rate? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

258,5 Crypto Exchanges Custody 1.6 Million Bitcoin or Close to 8% of the Capped Supply,"Dec 13, 2021","As of December 12, around 90% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist is in circulation today, and the top five exchanges hold 1.6 million bitcoin. The bitcoin holdings on Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, Kraken, and Okex combined represent 7.96% of the 21 million bitcoin supply cap. The bitcoin held by Coinbase is a whopping 51% of the 1.6 million bitcoin or $41.6 billion using today’s exchange rates. At the time of writing, 90% of the 21 million bitcoin supply cap has been mined into existence. Currently, there is 18,899,800 BTC that has been mined so far and in the near future, 19 million bitcoin will be mined into existence.We also know that a decent fraction of bitcoin has been lost and Satoshi Nakamoto may have mined around 1.1 million BTC before leaving the bitcoin community. A study published by Coin Metrics on November 19, 2019, indicates that the assumed amount of lost coins was around 1.5 million at block height 600,000.Today, five exchanges hold 1,673,460 bitcoin or $81.6 billion worth using today’s USD exchange rate. The five exchanges are Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, Kraken, and Okex and they all hold a significant amount of ethereum as well. Coinbase holds 853,530 BTC according to metrics from Bituniverse, Peckshield, and Chain.info.The company’s ether holdings are not disclosed but in terms of bitcoin, Coinbase holds 51% of the aggregate held on the top five exchanges. Binance holds 290,080 BTC or $14.1 billion and Binance also has a stash of 3.59 million ethereum worth $14.2 billion. Furthermore, Binance has 1.24 billion of tether (USDT) in reserves as well.Huobi has 160,950 BTC today, 2.13 million ether, and 747 million USDT as well. Metrics indicate that Kraken has 102,900 BTC in reserves and 2.27 million ethereum. Lastly, the fifth-largest digital currency exchange in terms of BTC reserves, Okex, has around 266,530 bitcoin but only 248,840 ethereum.Okex is followed by Gemini’s 116,000 BTC and 1.15 million ether, and Bitfinex’s 195,550 BTC and 353,660 ether in reserves. These exchanges are followed by Bittrex (48,110 BTC and 301,370 ether), Bitmex (111,650 BTC), and Bitflyer (75,030 BTC). Between the top five crypto exchanges, in terms of reserves, there’s $132.36 billion held on these platforms.The combination of all the reserves held on the top ten exchanges is around $165.89 billion. For some perspective, there’s more crypto value on the top ten exchanges than the entire stablecoin economy of $162.6 billion. In fact, the funds held on the top ten crypto trading platforms represent roughly 7.07% of the $2.343 trillion crypto economy.What do you think about the amount of crypto value held on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges today?

259,Analyst Expects US to Embrace Crypto With Proper Regulation in 2022 – Sees 'Refreshed' Bitcoin Bull Market,"Dec 12, 2021","Analyst Mike McGlone with Bloomberg Intelligence has shared his outlook for the cryptocurrency market going forward. “We expect the U.S. to embrace cryptocurrencies in 2022, with proper regulation and related bullish price implications,” he detailed. Noting that “Bitcoin appears to be on a trajectory for $100,000,” the analyst added that we are likely to see “A paused, corrected and refreshed bull market.”Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) published its 2022 crypto outlook report last week. “Incentivized by China’s ban and the proliferation of revolutionary technologies such as crypto dollars and non-fungible tokens (NFTs),” BI senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone explained:We expect the U.S. to embrace cryptocurrencies in 2022, with proper regulation and related bullish price implications.“The unlimited supply of fiat currency should sustain rising prices, notably in bitcoin and ethereum, which have limited supply,” he added. “We expect wider adoption to prevail and overcome most wobbles, like 2021’s near 50% correction.”Furthermore, “Some normalization in stock-market returns and a continued decline in U.S. Treasury bond yields may shine on Bitcoin and Ethereum in portfolios,” McGlone noted.The analyst further shared: “The key question facing bitcoin nearing the onset of 2022 is whether it’s peaking or simply a consolidating bull market. We believe it’s the latter, and see the benchmark crypto well on its way to becoming global digital collateral in a world going that way. It’s likely to be about key support around $50,000 and $100,000 resistance in 2022.”McGlone described:Bitcoin appears to be on a trajectory for $100,000 … A paused, corrected and refreshed bull market is how we see bitcoin approaching 2022.Regarding whether the price of BTC will hit $100K, the analyst emphasized: “We see it as more of a question of time, notably due to the economic basics of increasing demand vs. decreasing supply.”Do you agree with the analyst’s crypto outlook and prediction?

260,Bitcoin Hashrate Hits an All-Time High Suggesting Thousands of Next-Gen Machines Have Joined the Race,"Dec 12, 2021","While bitcoin prices have consolidated around the $50K zone, the network’s hashrate has reached an all-time high (ATH) on December 8, 2021, tapping 194.95 exahash per second. Bitcoin miners have increased their processing power a great deal despite the fact that mining bitcoin is 8.33% harder to mine since December 11.Bitcoin prices reached a few all-time price highs in 2021 breaking records from previous years. Similarly, Bitcoin’s hashrate has also seen record highs on two occasions this year as the SHA256 hash power has climbed exponentially. While BTC prices tapped an ATH of $64K in mid-April on May 9th Bitcoin’s hashrate hit a lifetime high at 191.42 exahash per second (EH/s). BTC prices once again reached another ATH on November 10, jumping to $69K per coin. As bitcoin prices have subsided around ​​26% since then, Bitcoin’s hashrate has skyrocketed to another lifetime high reaching 194.95 EH/s on December 8.Things have changed a great deal since the last hashrate ATH on May 9, as BTC saw the largest mining difficulty drop in its lifetime dipping 27.94%. After another 4.81% drop, the difficulty has increased nine times in a row since then. During the last four weeks, BTC’s mining difficulty slid 1.49% down and increased by 8.33% on December 11. In terms of mining difficulty, it is almost as hard to mine BTC as it was on May 13, with a 25 trillion difficulty parameter. Right now, the difficulty after the December 11 epoch change is 24.1 trillion which is just a hair lower than the difficulty’s ATH.Another change that can be seen since the May 9 hashrate high is the top mining pools have changed distribution significantly. Today’s top mining pool is Antpool with 19.39% of the global hashrate or 34.6 EH/s and the second-largest BTC mining pool is F2pool with 14.16% of the hashrate or 25.27 EH/s. Foundry USA has been a new top contender in recent months taking the third position on December 12, 2021, with 13.07% of the global hash power or 23.32 EH/s.During the last quarter of the year, unknown hashrate or stealth miners have been a prominent force in hash power distribution. Today, unknown hashrate is recorded as the fifth-largest mining entity with 12.20% of the global hashpower or 21.77 EH/s. BTC mining is still profitable as a machine that produces 110 terahash per second (TH/s) with $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) will get around $22 per day using today’s BTC exchange rates.During the last quarter in 2020 and first two quarters of 2021, there were many mining rig orders from enterprise mining operations. Many of which expected delivery of the top-of-the-line bitcoin mining devices by the year’s end and early 2022. Companies had ordered tens of thousands of next-generation mining rigs and it’s quite possible a fraction of these ordered machines are online now dedicating SHA256 hashrate to the network.What do you think about the bitcoin hashrate reaching an all-time high on December 8? What do you think about the changes bitcoin mining has seen in 2021 and what do you think is contributing to the recent hash power rise?

261,"'There's More Work to Do' — 11 Years Ago, Satoshi Nakamoto Sent a Final Message to the Bitcoin Community","Dec 12, 2021","To this day, Satoshi Nakamoto is one of Bitcoin’s biggest mysteries as people have searched far and wide to uncover the creator’s identity. 11 years ago, on December 12, 2010, the pseudonymous blockchain programmer (or programmers) left a final message to the crypto community stressing that “there’s more work to do on [denial-of-service] DoS.”Approximately 11 years ago on December 12, 2010, the inventor of Bitcoin left the community and has never returned. There were a few alleged emails that followed Satoshi Nakamoto’s departure from the community, when Bitcoin’s creator reportedly sent correspondence to the developers’ Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen. Satoshi first appeared 13 years ago, when the inventor published the Bitcoin white paper on Halloween (Oct. 31) in 2008. In terms of days between, Satoshi spent approximately 772 days or just over 2 years communicating with members of the nascent crypto community.So what did Satoshi do during the 772 day period? Bitcoin’s creator first told the world about the invention and sent approximately 16 emails about the peer-to-peer e-cash paper. These introductory emails were published to the cryptography mailing list hosted on metzdowd.com. Satoshi’s 17th email message on metzdowd.com was published exactly seven days after Nakamoto kickstarted the cryptocurrency network. The 17th email was published on January 8, 2009 and was called “Bitcoin v0.1 released.”Strong evidence suggests that a single entity started the network and it is assumed the single miner was Satoshi Nakamoto. A mining simulation published last year indicates that Satoshi probably used a single high-end personal computer (PC), using the Windows operation system, to mine 1.1 million bitcoin. If Satoshi is still alive and has access to this BTC, the crypto inventor is likely one of the wealthiest individuals on planet earth. It is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto mined anywhere between 750,000 to 1.1 million BTC during the 772 days.In addition to introducing the Bitcoin white paper and the emails that followed, Satoshi Nakamoto gave advice to community members and frequently spoke with developers during the two-year period the inventor was around. For years, people have pieced together Satoshi Nakamoto’s quotes and advice to see what the inventor truly meant. Nakamoto said things like: “[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.” Bitcoin’s creator also said:The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.Satoshi also discussed technological concepts like a hypothetical system called Bitdns, which eventually led to the creation of Namecoin and merged mining. Nakamoto was around as well when Wikileaks and Julian Assange decided to leverage bitcoin after the website was blocked by a financial blockade. When someone said that the Bitcoin community should “bring it on” with Wikileaks donations, Nakamoto wholeheartedly disagreed.“No, don’t ‘bring it on.’ The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage,” Nakamoto stressed.Some people believe that Wikileaks moving to use bitcoin in 2010 may have upset Satoshi enough for the inventor to leave. Prior to Satoshi’s final email on December 12, the day before on the 11th, Nakamoto complained about Wikileaks adopting BTC.“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us,” Satoshi said at the time.The very next day was Satoshi’s final message to the community as a whole. The message on December 12 was all business as the crypto inventor offered a quick build, and told developers that there’s more work to be done on denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.“There’s more work to do on DoS, but I’m doing a quick build of what I have so far in case it’s needed, before venturing into more complex ideas. The build for this is version 0.3.19,” Satoshi explained that day. Satoshi added:– Added some DoS controls. As Gavin and I have said clearly before, the software is not at all resistant to DoS attack. This is one improvement, but there are still more ways to attack than I can count. I’m leaving the -limitfreerelay part as a switch for now and it’s there if you need it. – Removed “safe mode” alerts. ‘Safe mode’ alerts was a temporary measure after the 0.3.9 overflow bug. We can say all we want that users can just run with “-disablesafemode”, but it’s better just not to have it for the sake of appearances. It was never intended as a long term feature. Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain.Following this message, Satoshi Nakamoto never addressed the public and bitcoin community via a forum message again. There are certainly individuals that have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and messages that followed after the December 12 forum post on bitcointalk.org. However, nothing that has followed has been proven as reliable and to date, no individual has been able to prove they invented Bitcoin either.The December 12 forum post was Satoshi’s final message to the nascent crypto community and quite possibly, the inventor’s way of saying goodbye.What do you think about the final message Satoshi Nakamoto wrote to the public on bitcointalk.org 11 years ago today? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

262,"Prime Minister Modi's Twitter Account Hacked — Tweets Bitcoin Legal Tender in India, Government Giving Away BTC","Dec 12, 2021","The Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was compromised and a tweet was posted claiming that the government of India has adopted bitcoin as legal tender and purchased 500 coins to distribute to all residents in the country. This hack came at a critical time in India as the government is actively working on cryptocurrency legislation.The Twitter handle of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hacked Saturday and a tweet promoting a bitcoin scam was posted on the account. The tweet reads:India has officially adopted bitcoin as legal tender. The government has officially bought 500 BTC and is distributing them to all residents in the country.The tweet also contained a link to a website promoting a bitcoin giveaway scam. At the time of writing, the scam website on blogspot.com has been removed.Prime Minister Modi’s account was soon restored and the bitcoin scam tweet was deleted.The official account for the Office of the Prime Minister of India then announced on Twitter that the Twitter handle for Prime Minister Modi “was very briefly compromised.” It added that “The matter was escalated to Twitter and the account has been immediately secured. In the brief period that the account was compromised, any tweet shared must be ignored.”This is not the first time the account of Prime Minister Modi was hacked. In June last year, his account was compromised as part of a much larger-scale hack involving several other world leaders, major companies, and celebrities. The hackers also used the compromised accounts to tweet about a bitcoin giveaway scam.In September, Modi’s Twitter account was hacked again. Tweets asking for bitcoin donations for the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for Covid-19 were posted on the account.Bitcoin giveaway scams are very common in the crypto space. Scammers have used the names and likeness of several influencers and celebrities to promote their giveaway scams, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor.Modi’s Twitter account hack came at a time when India is contemplating regulating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A crypto bill has been listed to be considered in Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament.There are reports suggesting that Modi will take a final decision on India’s crypto legislation. He has reportedly hosted at least two high-level meetings on crypto. Modi recently urged leaders of democratic nations to collaborate to ensure cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, do not fall into the wrong hands. At the Summit for Democracy hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden last week, Modi said that crypto should be used to empower democracy.What do you think about hackers tweeting about bitcoin from Prime Minister Modi’s account?

264,Miami Mayor Francis Suarez Plans to Take a Fraction of His 401k in Bitcoin,"Dec 11, 2021","During the first week of November, the reelected Miami mayor Francis Suarez explained that he would receive part of his salary in bitcoin via the payment processor Strike. A month later, speaking at Real Vision’s Takeover event in Las Vegas, Suarez revealed he plans to take part of his 401k in bitcoin as well.Miami mayor Francis Suarez is a big fan of bitcoin (BTC) and he has spoken about his fascination with cryptocurrency on various occasions. In mid-October, Suarez told the press that he was building Miami into America’s crypto capital and the mayor stressed that cryptocurrency is a “major priority” for him. Suarez also told Chinese miners to relocate to Miami and leverage Florida’s abundant nuclear energy after China banned bitcoin mining.Last month, Suarez revealed he was utilizing the third-party payment processor Strike to get a portion of his paycheck converted into bitcoin. Additionally, a growing number of mayors in cities across the U.S. have explained they too have an interest in getting paid in bitcoin. Now Miami mayor Francis Suarez is taking it a step further and converting some of his retirement money into bitcoin as well. Speaking with the Real Vision managing editor Samuel Burke in Las Vegas, Suarez remarked that it was a “personal choice.”“I just think it is a good asset to be invested in. I think it’s one that’s obviously going to appreciate over time. It’s one that I believe in,” Suarez said. Burke asked the Miami mayor if he would invest his 401k in bitcoin next year and Suarez replied, “Oh yeah! Definitely.” The Miami mayor further added:Blockchain has succeeded so well because people have confidence in it. They have confidence in it because they see that it’s an open-source and an un-manipulatable system. And I think that is the source of the popularity and why it’s done so well.Suarez explained last month that Miami residents may soon get access to a “bitcoin yield” that stems from the city’s own crypto-asset called “Miamicoin (MIA).” New York City also has its own coin called “NYC” and both NYC and MIA can be mined. The Miami mayor also told Real Vision’s managing editor that Miami residents will soon be able to pay municipal fees in BTC.“We just had an industry day for bitcoin exchanges, and we’re in the process of putting out an RFP (request for proposal) on that,” Suarez remarked during his interview. The Miami mayor told Burke that because he has income stemming from the private sector it gives him the right to invest his 401k in crypto. “I do have private-sector income,” Suarez concluded. “So, in fairness, my mayoral salary is not 100% of my income. So it’s a part of my income I can do this type of investment with.”What do you think about Miami mayor Francis Suarez getting part of his 401k in bitcoin?

265,Bitcoin Mining Company Cleanspark to Kick-Start 20 MW Immersion Cooling Initiative,"Dec 11, 2021","Cleanspark, a sustainability-focused bitcoin mining company, has announced it will kick-start a 20 MW initiative in its Norcross bitcoin mining facility where miners will be cooled via immersion. The company will host more than 5,900 miners in this facility, which will be submerged into tanks of a biodegradable liquid. Cleanspark states this will help them save energy and increase the hashrate obtained from the miners.Cleanspark, a sustainability-focused bitcoin mining company, announced it will start shifting to the use of alternative, more efficient methods of cooling its miners. The company revealed the establishment of a 20 MW immersion cooling initiative in its already established Norcross bitcoin mining facility, being one of the first mining companies to implement such technology on a large scale.The company will organize almost 6,000 miners that will be submerged in 180 tanks of liquid distributed across the whole mining facility. Cleanspark will not have to retrofit anything to install the tanks required for this, an advantage that immersion cooling presents. Each tank will hold 33 Antminer S19j Pro miners.This move will allow the company to get better performance from the miners and at the same time save energy, reducing power consumption by 20%, according to a PR statement.While liquid cooling is not new in the mining industry, with some small miners managing to build their own immersion mining systems, it is just recently starting to make sense to implement this solution in mining operations working on a bigger scale. This has to do with the benefits these companies can now obtain by implementing this new technology in already existent data centers.Cleanspark CEO Zach Bradford stated:We are constantly seeking ways to make our operations more sustainable and productive while achieving maximum performance. Deploying an environment-friendly cooling technology that also increases the economics of our bitcoin mining operations was an obvious choice for us.The company acquired the Norfolk data center in August, hoping for this initiative to be built before the end of the year. This is not the only project that big mining companies have announced using immersion cooling recently, either. Riot Blockchain, a Nasdaq-listed mining company, recently announced that it would cool half of the capacity of its new facility in Texas with immersion cooling, with 46K miners involved in that operation.What do you think about Cleanspark’s move to leverage immersion cooling?

266,Bitcoin.com Wallet Adds Support For Multisig (Shared) Wallets,"Dec 10, 2021","The Bitcoin.com Team is excited to announce support for shared (multisig) wallets for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in the Bitcoin.com Wallet. That means you can protect your most valuable wallets with a unique form of two-factor authentication, set up a corporate treasury, safely introduce your kids to Bitcoin, and more.Standard crypto wallets use one private key to access and send transactions while shared wallets require two or more private keys to access the funds connected with the wallet. Private keys in shared wallets are often given to different people, called participants. For example, if you have three private keys, you might keep one yourself and give the others to family members.The first key reason to use a shared wallet is that it is a solution to the problem of having a single point of failure, which can result in losing access to your funds. For example, imagine there is a fire in the apartment building you live in. Your computer and the paper backup keys for your assets (BTC/BCH) are destroyed. Without the keys, you have no way to access your funds. But if your wallet is shared with others (who don’t live in your building!), or even with yourself assuming you’ve saved your secondary recovery phrase in a different location, you’ll still have access to your money.By introducing multiple decision makers, shared wallets unlock a range of unique applications. For example, you can introduce savings for your child by providing her with some funds in a crypto wallet. If it’s a shared wallet, you’ll have the chance to review any transactions initiated before approving or declining. Another common use case is treasury management. Here, business partners or even a board of directors can be shared wallet participants, ensuring transparency in the use of funds while bypassing the legacy banking system. Here’s a list of more ways shared crypto wallets can be used.For more details on how to set up and use a shared wallet, please refer to this guide for Bitcoin and this guide for Bitcoin Cash.

268,Iceland Refuses to Power New Bitcoin Farms Amid Electricity Shortages,"Dec 9, 2021","Cryptocurrency mining is among several energy-intensive industries hurt by a power deficit in Iceland. The country’s main utility is now rejecting requests to connect new coin minting facilities to the grid, after cutting supply to aluminum smelters and fish factories. Iceland’s largest utility, Landsvirkjun, has been forced to limit energy supplies to power-hungry industrial customers including aluminum producers and fish processing plants. The restrictions have been applied to consumers with curtailable short-term contracts as well. Data centers mining digital currencies are among the affected enterprises and the company has been turning away new bitcoin miners.Landsvirkjun explained the need for the reduction citing a malfunction at a power station and the low water reservoir levels, Bloomberg reported. The supplier also faced a delay in sourcing electricity from an external producer. The utility announced on Tuesday that the cuts were effective immediately.Unusually high demand for electricity has been another key factor for the deficit, noted Tinna Traustadottir, executive vice president of sales and customer service at Landsvirkjun. Iceland’s giant smelters have been a major consumer for decades but a growing number of cryptocurrency miners, attracted by the island nation’s cheap energy, are now playing a role, too.Crypto mining companies such as the Canadian Hive Blockchain Technologies and the Hong Kong-listed Genesis Mining and Bitfury Holding are among those that are already operating coin minting facilities in the country. Landsvirkjun said, however, that it’s now rejecting requests from new customers in the mining sector.The company further elaborated that due to limitations of Iceland’s distribution system, it cannot serve load points from the country’s biggest power station, Karahnjukavirkjun. The plant is located in the eastern part of the country while the island’s western region is mainly the one experiencing deficits.News of Iceland’s troubles with electricity shortages comes after two other Nordic nations, Sweden and Norway, voiced concerns about the rising energy needs and growing environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. In November, Swedish regulators called for an EU-wide ban on crypto mining. A couple of weeks later, the Norwegian government indicated it may support Sweden’s proposal.Do you think Iceland will lift the restrictions for new crypto mining farms once it deals with its current power deficit? Tell us in the comments section below.

270,Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Believes Blockchain Is More Important Than Bitcoin,"Dec 8, 2021","David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, one of the leading banking institutions in the world, has stated his opinion on the bitcoin vs blockchain dilemma. To Solomon, bitcoin is not as important as the advancements in technology that implementing blockchain and other new ledger-based tools can bring to the traditional finance world. The executive further stated he doesn’t own bitcoin or ethereum personally.David Solomon, CEO of one of the biggest banks in the world, Goldman Sachs, has explained that for him, bitcoin is less important than the technology behind it. The executive issued these statements in an interview on CNBC’s Squawkbox on Tuesday. When asked about his views on crypto, Solomon answered:My view on, on bitcoin for example is I really don’t know but it’s really not something, you know, individually that’s important to me.Furthermore, he argued that the true value of bitcoin lies in the technology that powers it, blockchain, and how it can affect the future of the financing world. Solomon stated that he is a ‘”big believer” in the disruption that these technologies are causing, and that Goldman Sachs is also trying to participate in this revolution vis its services app.Solomon also stated that in his opinion, bitcoin was not essential in the view of the banking industry, and that was the influence of the new technologies that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have brought with it that was the key for the modernization of current banking platforms. Solomon stressed:I think bitcoin is really not the key thing. The key thing is how can blockchain or other technologies that are not developed yet accelerate the pace of the digitization of the way financial services are delivered.However, he did state that as a speculative asset it was important for Goldman Sachs to offer bitcoin to its customers, to let them bet on the market behavior of the currency.In the last year, bitcoin (BTC) has been vindicated as a valid asset by several important banking institutions, including JPMorgan, which had criticized the true utility of bitcoin’s proposal several times in the past. The bank started offering access to cryptocurrency investments for its customers earlier this year. The critics of its CEO Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was worthless before, didn’t affect the ability of the bank to provide this kind of service to its customers.What do you think about David Solomon’s “blockchain, not bitcoin” approach?

While acknowledging recent price swings of the cryptocurrency, the strategist emphasized that bitcoin has so far regained its losses in short periods of time.Fundstrat Global Advisors’ managing partner and head of research, Thomas Lee, talked about the outlook for bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Monday.Lee is a Wall Street strategist with more than 25 years of experience in equity research. Prior to co-founding Fundstrat, he was J.P. Morgan’s chief equity strategist from 2007 to 2014.The Fundstrat strategist recommends investment in bitcoin, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency still has “exponential growth ahead” as it becomes more mainstream.While acknowledging that the price of BTC suffered a decline recently, he insisted that it made more sense to hold the cryptocurrency through volatility rather than trade the fluctuations. He explained:Every year, bitcoin makes all of its gains in 10 days and if you don’t own bitcoin for those 10 days, you are down 25% a year. To me, the kind of weekend massacre that happened, it’s painful but it’s pretty common.Last week, Lee commented on Square CEO Jack Dorsey stepping down as the CEO of Twitter. The Fundstrat strategist sees Dorsey’s departure as bullish for crypto. He emphasized that it is still the earliest days for the crypto space, not only for projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also “the amount of crypto equities and businesses built around crypto.”Lee is not the only one who sees an upside to bitcoin. Billionaire Barry Sternlicht, the chairman of Starwood Capital Group, said last week that bitcoin could be worth a million dollars a coin. Meanwhile, Microstrategy’s CEO sees bitcoin becoming a $100 trillion asset class.

272,Billionaire Barry Sternlicht Discusses Bitcoin Price Rising to $1 Million — Calls BTC a 'Smart' Hedge,"Dec 7, 2021","The chairman of Starwood Capital Group, billionaire Barry Sternlicht, has shared his view on how bitcoin could grow to be worth a million dollars a coin. He calls the cryptocurrency a “smart” hedge in a world where the government just keeps on printing money.
Billionaire Barry Sternlicht, the chairman of Starwood Capital Group, talked about the future outlook for cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, Friday while speaking at a Bloomberg event in Miami.Sternlicht runs Starwood Capital Group, a private equity firm that specializes in real estate investments. The firm has about $100 billion under management in real estate, debt, and energy assets. According to Forbes’ list of billionaires, his current net worth is $4.2 billion.Noting that he has called his bitcoin position a “great hedge,” the billionaire was asked, “Is that how we all should be thinking?” Sternlicht firmly replied, “Yes.”He explained that we live “In a world where the government just prints money, and prints money, and prints money, and prints money, and doesn’t seem to have any consequences.” Noting that “Sometimes, that will end,” the billionaire stressed:The only thing that they can’t make more of is bitcoin.He added that bitcoin has “never been hacked,” but noted that “It has no real value other than there’s 21 million coins” that are “infinitely divisible.”In comparison, he pointed out that gold also “really doesn’t have a lot of value,” adding that “You can have your gold jewelry but it could be silver or titanium or platinum.”Sternlicht opined: “You could see the world saying to the U.S., especially with our political isolationism, they would say China is going to try to knock us off the dollar standard, and they are going to have a lot of countries aligned with them.”The Starwood Capital executive emphasized: “They are going to try really hard. It’s very obvious. They are going to try really hard to break the dollar standard. If that happens and the dollar devalues, you need one thing that could hold its value.”While admitting that bitcoin “will go down with the stock market,” he stressed that in his opinion, “it will reverse,” elaborating:It would go to $1 million a coin. It could do that because everyone, it’s not U.S. investors, the whole world will look at one thing that they can’t make more of and that would be bitcoin.“There’s no function other than a store of value so having a little investment in bitcoin, I think, might be a smart little hedge in your life because your paper will be worthless, unfortunately,” he warned.The billionaire then disclosed that he has about 2% to 3% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Regarding crypto investment, he said: “If it goes to zero, it won’t hurt me either, it won’t hurt you.” However, he emphasized:But if it goes to $1 million a coin, you are going to look at the TV and get very upset.A growing number of billionaires are using bitcoin to hedge against inflation.Famed hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said in October that he preferred bitcoin over gold. Orlando Bravo, the billionaire who co-founded private equity firm Thoma Bravo, said in September that he is very bullish about bitcoin, expecting it to increase “significantly.”Last week, Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego said the U.S. “is looking more and more like any other irresponsible third world country.” Salinas tweeted a weekly chart of the total value of the Federal Reserve’s assets (less eliminations from consolidation) and commented: “Wow…look at the scale of fake money creation. Buy bitcoin right now.”Do you agree with Barry Sternlicht about bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

273,"Bitwise CIO Says $100K Bitcoin a Difficult Prediction to Make, Calls Ethereum the 'Asset of the Year'","Dec 7, 2021","While there’s been an awful lot of calls for bitcoin to reach six-digits in value in 2021, as the end of the year draws closer, it doesn’t seem like $100K per bitcoin will happen. Bitwise Asset Management’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan told the press on Monday that “$100,000 by the end of the year is a difficult prediction to make.”For a good portion of the year, many bitcoin advocates, experts, luminaries, and analysts predicted that bitcoin (BTC) would surely hit the $100K per unit range in 2021. One of the most popular forecasts belongs to Plan B, the creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price model. Plan B said based on the pseudonymous analyst’s “worst case scenario for 2021 (price/on-chain based)” would be “Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K.”However, November’s price call missed and the $135K prediction looks like it will miss as well. Bitcoin would have to double in value over the next 24 days gathering a touch over 96% during that time. Plan B is not the only one that has predicted BTC could hit six-digits in USD value by the year’s end. The financial institution Standard Chartered predicted at the beginning of September that bitcoin’s value could reach $100K by the end of the year.Yahoo Finance contributor, Javier David, said on October 21, that “suddenly, a bitcoin move to $100K doesn’t seem so farfetched.” In fact there’s a great number of analysts that have said that at some point in the future, bitcoin prices will touch the six-digit zone or $100,000 or more per unit. Speaking with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Bitwise Asset Management’s CIO Matt Hougan explains that bitcoin hitting $100K will be difficult in 2021. Hougan further explained that ethereum (ETH) was the “asset of the year” in 2021.“I think as we look into 2022, we still have these fundamental drivers, the institutions we speak to every day at Bitwise,” Hougan explained. “$100,000 by the end of the year is a difficult prediction to make — I think $100,000 could be in target in 2022 but this year, I’m not so sure,” Hougan remarked.As far as the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, ethereum (ETH), Hougan thinks 2021 was the digital currency’s year. While noting to Bloomberg’s Chang that ethereum was the “asset of the year,” Hougan also stressed that there will be an “explosion of activity built on Ethereum” next year. But investors will be looking at other smart contract blockchain networks as well, the Bitwise CIO said. Hougan added:Investors are going to be looking at Ethereum, Solana, or Polygon. Investors are starting to realize there’s more to crypto than just Bitcoin. If there’s one bigger story for next year, it’s going to be everything else: crypto as defi, NFTs, Web3, or metaverse.What do you think about the Bitwise CIO’s cryptocurrency predictions?

274,AOC Says She Doesn't Hold Bitcoin so the Lawmaker 'Can Do Her Job Ethically',"Dec 7, 2021","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, otherwise known as AOC, is a New York representative well known for her political stances and statements. The Democrat believes that it is “absolutely wild” that U.S. representatives can buy and swap popular stocks. AOC also thinks it’s not ethical for members of Congress to own cryptocurrencies.Lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) discussed owning bitcoin (BTC) in a recent Instagram story she told on Monday. AOC explained that she doesn’t believe members of Congress should own stocks and the same morality applies to digital currencies in her opinion. During her Instagram story, AOC said she doesn’t hold BTC because she wants to remain impartial and an unbiased lawmaker.“Because we have access to sensitive information and upcoming policy, I do not believe members of Congress should hold [or] trade individual stocks and I choose not to hold any so I can remain impartial about policy marking,” AOC insisted on Instagram. “I also extend that to digital assets/currencies (especially because I sit on the Financial Services Committee). So the answer is no because I want to do my job as ethically and impartially as I can,” AOC further stressed in her Instagram story.Close to four years ago in December 2017, AOC was asked if she accepted bitcoin after she tweeted about a fundraising campaign that year. “Not [until] Actblue does,” AOC said at the time. “Also I’m not sure about FEC laws regarding crypto. Good question,” she added. “Sadly reporting this info is law and must be collected, even with cash donations,” AOC continued on Twitter. “It’s unfortunate that our campaign finance laws demand more stringent reporting of regular small donors than they do from Superpacs.”In recent times, AOC has started ferocious debates over her “Tax the Rich” Met Gala dress. She and her colleagues Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley attempted to get president Joe Biden to choose someone other than Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve. Biden ultimately chose Powell, but AOC wanted the U.S. president to choose a Fed chair that would address social change and the so-called climate crisis.What do you think about AOC’s declaration that she doesn’t own bitcoin so she can remain impartial as a U.S. lawmaker?

276,"2021's BTC Obituary List Accelerated This Year, 41 Alleged Bitcoin Deaths Recorded","Dec 6, 2021","As bitcoin and a number of crypto assets have dropped in value during the last two weeks, its seems that everyone’s hope for six-digit bitcoin prices has become unattainable. However, year-to-date, bitcoin has risen more than 150% in value and despite the rise, skeptics and critics continue to assume bitcoin is dead. In fact, the infamous bitcoin obituary list indicates that 2021 is tied with 2019 for having the third-largest number of obituaries in a year.On November 10, bitcoin (BTC) tapped an all-time price high at $69K per unit and has since slid below the $50K zone. It seems that higher prices give skeptics the opportunity to declare bitcoin is dead after the leading crypto asset sheds a decent amount of value during market downturns. In 2017, when BTC came awfully close to reaching $20K per unit, the bitcoin obituaries list, hosted on 99bitcoins.com shows that there were 124 bitcoin deaths that year.The second-largest year for BTC obituaries was the following year in 2018, as there were 93 declarations made saying bitcoin has met its demise. This month, 2021 has tied 2019 for the third-largest number of bitcoin deaths in a year’s time. Following the crypto bear market after 2017’s all-time price high, 2019 captured an aggregate of 41 bitcoin obituaries. As of November 29, 2021, 2021 has accrued the same amount of death sentences.The last obituary written about BTC, on November 29, was published by the author Bill Blain via the website capx.co. The bitcoin obituary is called “Bitcoin Is Nothing But A Ponzi Scheme,” and Blain claims cryptocurrencies also accelerate inflation.https://t.co/vUM0HqkFZ3Cryptocurrencies are a classic illustration of the economic theory of the 'greater fool’…Bitcoin only has value as long as there's more dupes to sell it toIf something has to explain to you why it's money, it isn't#markets #investing #Crypto— Bill Blain (@Bill_Blain) November 30, 2021“Crypto is bogus, and is not money,” the bitcoin obituary written by Blain insists. “It’s far too volatile to be a store of value, it is scarce and not a unit of account. I could explain why it can’t work as money because it is likely to prove an inflationary accelerant, equivalent to pouring petrol on a fire.”Furthermore, Blain says that once in a while he reads about the blockchain technology behind digital assets. “Periodically, I delve into the myriad of utter rubbish that masquerades as the blockchain genius, the maths and computing logic behind cryptos,” Blain stresses in his opinion piece. “Read it yourself – it’s 10% fascinating and 90% utter garbage. Mathematical dyslexia puked out and dressed up as original thinking and ‘proof of concept.’” Blain’s scathing review of the crypto economy adds:Cryptos have thrived because social media, the internet and connectivity have made it easy to disseminate the con around the global markets at incredible speed. They’ve succeeded because regulators haven’t stopped them – hat-tip to the Chinese for being ahead of the regulatory pack in that regard. Someday, the last greater fool will want his money back, and regulators will be exposed for not acting earlier.Despite Blain’s opinion and the 40 other bitcoin obituaries that preceded his opinion editorial, bitcoin (BTC) is alive and well. There are not many assets that exist in this world that could be called “dead” or “near-deceased” after climbing more than 150% higher in value in 12 months. Blain also criticizes cryptocurrencies in general, many of which have seen their values swell by significantly larger percentages than BTC’s year-to-date gains.The number of so-called bitcoin deaths in 2021 recorded on 99bitcoins.com is also much larger than BTC’s first four years of bitcoin obituaries combined. This shows that the more BTC and the crypto economy mature, the more blowback they seem to get from critics and skeptics. While there’s been a lot of 2021 death calls, it seems as though they are just not strong enough theories to stop bitcoin from gathering another year’s worth of obituaries in 2022.What do you think about the bitcoin obituaries list gathering 41 deaths this year?

277,Salvadoran Ecologist Claims Nayib Bukele's Volcano-Powered Bitcoin Mine Will 'End in Environmental Disaster',"Dec 6, 2021","El Salvador’s leading ecologist Ricardo Navarro believes that mining bitcoin with a volcano, or geothermal energy, will “end in environmental disaster.” Navarro believes geothermal energy costs more than oil, and thinks El Salvador’s millennial president Nayib Bukele’s decision is questionable.During the second week of June, El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele told the public that the Latin American country planned to mine bitcoin (BTC) with energy stemming from volcanoes located in the country. At the end of September, Bukele shared a video of the initial construction of the Salvadoran volcano-powered bitcoin mining facility. Now the president and his government have been criticized by El Salvador’s leading ecologist Ricardo Navarro.The Salvadoran ecologist explained to Telegraph contributor Simeon Tegel that developing a ‘Bitcoin City’ next to a volcano doesn’t make sense. “Talking about building this city beside a volcano is like thinking you are rich because you live next to a bank,” Navarro said. Navarro also detailed that geothermal energy is still a costly endeavor and won’t be much better than using petroleum sources. Navarro insists:​​Geothermal still costs more than oil, otherwise we would already be using more of it. What will end up happening is that we will just be buying more oil.Navarro is concerned about the consequences of the world’s so-called climate crisis. The ecologist runs a non-governmental organization CESTA (Salvadoran Center for Appropriate Technology) and he recently discussed the subject with Politico’s contributing author, Bjarke Smith-Meyer, on November 10.At that time, Navarro dismissed the volcano-powered bitcoin mining facility idea as he wholeheartedly believes the facility will require more energy resources than just geothermal power. “I am under the impression that Bukele doesn’t really understand what is going on [with] the energy situation,” Navarro told the reporter. “That is certainly going to complicate… demand.”Navarro also claims that the digital currency environment in El Salvador could attract drug lords. The Salvadoran ecologist says that the bitcoin tender law was rushed and implemented without debate. “If you have something good to promote, you propose it, you discuss it, and then you put your arguments. But that was not the case with bitcoin,” Navarro stressed to Smith-Meyer.What do you think about the Salvadoran ecologist’s opinion concerning the volcano-powered bitcoin mining facility in El Salvador?

280,"Bitcoin Hashrate Rises Despite Price Drop, Mystery Hashpower Returns","Dec 5, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has increased a great deal, even after the leading crypto asset’s price slipped below the $50K price zone. Eight days ago the network hashrate was coasting along at 168 exahash per second (EH/s), and this past week it increased 7.73% to today’s 181 EH/s. Following the price drop under the $50K zone, Bitcoin’s (BTC) hashrate remains strong and has increased more than 7% higher during the last week. At the time of writing, BTC’s hashrate on Sunday is 181.59 EH/s as the network’s processing power has been reaching daily highs.Three month statistics indicate BTC’s hashpower tapped 190 EH/s on Friday, December 3. Metrics show that the network’s hashrate reached an all-time high on May 9, 2021 at 191.42 EH/s. One reason the hashrate remains high despite the recent price drop is because the network’s mining difficulty has dropped during the last difficulty change on November 28.The change that day saw BTC’s first mining difficulty decrease since July 17. The difficulty dropped seven days ago making it 1.49% less difficult to mine BTC. The current difficulty is 22.34 trillion and at the current rate of processing power, the next difficulty is estimated to increase 1.17% to a possible 22.6 trillion.There are only 13 known pools dedicating SHA256 hashpower to the Bitcoin blockchain and unknown hashrate otherwise known as stealth miners command 11.75% (19.84 EH/s) of the network’s hashpower.Bitmain’s Antpool is the largest miner in terms of network hashpower today with 17.94% (30.28 EH/s) of the hashrate. The second-largest mining pool on December 5 is Foundry USA with 16.49% or 27.84 EH/s of hashpower. Just above Foundry USA is F2pool, which commands 13.20% of hashrate or 22.27 EH/s.Between mid-October up until now, a sum of unknown hashrate or stealth miners have been very prominent on the network. For 50 days straight the unknown hashrate has consumed a great number of BTC blocks.Since 2009 stealth miners have found 226,000 BTC block rewards and during the last six months 1,957 blocks were discovered by unknown hashrate.Hashpower that stems from numerous regions worldwide, derives mostly from countries such as the United States, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, Germany, and Iran.What do you think about Bitcoin’s hashpower increasing after the difficulty decrease and despite the recent price drop?

281,Crypto Flash Crash Prompts El Salvador to Buy the Dip — 150 Bitcoins Added to Treasury,"Dec 4, 2021","As the crypto market shed billions of dollars, El Salvador bought the dip, taking advantage of the falling price of bitcoin early Saturday morning. With the latest buy, El Salvador has purchased a total of 1,370 bitcoins altogether. According to Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele, the coins were bought seven minutes before the price of the cryptocurrency bottomed out.The price of many cryptocurrencies began plummeting late Friday night, with bitcoin sliding almost 14% from slightly above $52K at 11:42 p.m. EDT to below $45K at 12:28 a.m. based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. At the time of writing, the price of BTC is hovering around $48,040.Taking advantage of the falling price of bitcoin, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted at 12:19 a.m. about his country’s latest BTC purchase. “El Salvador just bought the dip! 150 coins at an average USD price of ~$48,670.” He followed up with another tweet a few minutes later: “Missed the f***ing bottom by 7 minutes.”El Salvador has taken advantage of bitcoin’s price dips several times. On Nov. 26, Bukele revealed that his country bought 100 more BTC as the price of the cryptocurrency dropped following reports of a new Covid-19 variant, now known as omicron.Bitcoin was made legal tender in El Salvador alongside the U.S. dollar in September. Since then, El Salvador has purchased 1,370 BTC altogether.Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the country against using bitcoin as legal tender. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, similarly cautioned that he is worried about El Salvador making bitcoin a national currency. Bukele responded to the boss of the British central bank by stating, “I’m really concerned about Bank of England printing money out of thin air.”What do you think about El Salvador buying the dip again?

At the time of writing, the crypto economy is down more than 16% and the price of bitcoin slid below the $50K zone to a low of $43,972 per unit. Since then, bitcoin has managed to climb back to just above the $47K per unit position.Digital currency markets have lost significant value during the last 24 hours as billions have left the crypto economy in a matter of hours. Currently, the crypto economy and its 11,388 coins in existence have lost more than 16% in USD value. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped from the $53K per unit region to $43.9K during the first hour of Saturday morning.The downward slide took BTC down 17.16% but the crypto asset has since regained 7.28% following the market carnage. BTC has managed to rise above the $47K region and has an overall market valuation of around $895 billion. Seven-day statistics indicate bitcoin (BTC) has lost 11.5% but 30 day stats show the price is down 25.2%.The second-largest market valuation, held by ethereum (ETH), lost 13.9% during the last 24 hours but seven-day metrics indicate ether is only down by 2.2% after reaching its all-time high (ATH) last week.

283,"Terra Tokenomics Lead to Market Surge, Bitcoin Reserve Hinted","Dec 4, 2021","The recent movements in the treasury of Terra, a decentralized financial payment network, which is now burning more than $4 billion worth of LUNA due to a governance proposal, have seemingly made the price of the asset rise to all-time high (ATH) levels. This rise has been also accompanied by new proposals to further cement the stability of its stablecoin, UST. Do Kwon, head of Terraform Labs, hinted at the inclusion of a bitcoin reserve to safeguard UST’s dollar peg.The recent changes in the issuance model of Terra, which were brought by the recent Columbus 5 update, seem to have been successful in fostering the growth of the currency of the network, LUNA. The price of its native asset, LUNA, has grown significantly, reaching ATH levels at $69.59 yesterday, recording an increase in the price of more than 50% during the last week. One of the most interesting choices taken by the cryptocurrency project was the burn of more than $4 billion worth of LUNA that was held in the community pool of the project.These LUNA tokens have been exchanged constantly for UST, the sibling stablecoin of the project, and are now waiting to be used for other purposes. This was part of a change in the issuance model of UST.Until now, there are no other tokens used as collateral to back the value of the UST stablecoin. This might, at some times, cause that the peg with the underlying currency (the U.S. dollar) to be lost due to different reasons. Due to the limitations of the model and the incentives to maintain the token peg in some situations, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon has hinted at the introduction of other solutions to address this issue.Do Kwon stated in a recent Twitter thread:I’ve grown quite tired of arguing with idiots on Twitter on whether UST can remain stable in bear. So soon I will propose creating multi billion dollar reserves in decentralized assets (BTC and others) in an attempt to save myself time.If this really comes to happen, Terra would become a hybrid project, featuring a reserve that would back the value of the UST stablecoin in bear markets. Also, Kwon hinted at the use of the UST locked in the community pool as insurance for the currency and to also serve as backing to protect the UST from a possible de-peg.Editor’s Note: Since the time of writing, markets have taken a significant downturn on December 4, with terra (LUNA) now down over 17% in the last 24 hours. What do you think about the recent rise of Terra in the market? Tell us in the comments section below.

284,"Ethereum Might Dethrone Bitcoin as Best Crypto Store of Value, Study Argues","Dec 4, 2021","A recent paper authored by members of several universities, including Sydney and Macquarie, argues that recent changes in Ethereum monetary policy are making it a better store of value than bitcoin. The deflationary effect that the EIP-1559 proposal has caused in the issuance of the currency is said to be the main cause of this. A new paper released by members of Australian universities last month is putting the spotlight on Ethereum and its possible future as a store of value. The paper, titled “Better than Bitcoin? Can cryptocurrencies beat inflation?,” is authored by Ester Félez-Viñas of the University of Technology in Sydney and other academics, and compares the issuance of Bitcoin with the new issuance model of Ethereum, that is making the currency deflationary.The paper states:We show that following the recent change in its transactions protocol, the digital currency Ethereum displays a significantly lower net issuance rate of tokens than Bitcoin, achieved by destroying the feesassociated with each transaction.This has to do with the activation of EIP-1559, a proposal that burns Ethereum in a proportional way to the usage of the network. While this proposal had some opposition when it was presented — mainly from miners and mining pools — it is now contributing to this new appreciation of Ethereum as a possibly deflationary currency in the future.The implementation of EIP-1559 has caused the network to burn a significant amount of Ethereum in fees. This change has led to more than one million ETH being put out of circulation after just three months of its implementation on mainnet. Regarding this, the study remarks:In many cases the amount of Ethereum burned outpaces the network’s creation of new tokens, resulting in Ethereum potentially becoming the world’s first deflationary currency. We argue that this provides better inflationary hedging properties than Bitcoin, and Ether may therefore offer a superior long-term value storage than Bitcoin.Other cryptocurrency projects are adopting similar burning schemes hoping to recreate the same effect. Binance coin recently activated an update to its network that also implemented fee burning. However, Binance coin and Ethereum are fundamentally different: The latter has no cap on its issuance, while Binance coin does have a hard issuance cap.What do you think about the “Better than Bitcoin? Can cryptocurrencies beat inflation?” paper and its conclusions? Tell us in the comments section below.

285,FBI Seizes Bitcoin Worth More Than $2.2 Million From Ransomware Affiliate,"Dec 3, 2021","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has seized bitcoin worth more than $2.2 million tied to ransomware payments. The cryptocurrency allegedly belongs to an affiliate of Gandcrab and Revil/Sodinokibi ransomware.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has seized almost 40 bitcoins from a Russian resident tied to Revil and Gandcrab ransomware, according to a court document unsealed Tuesday. The forfeiture complaint reads:The United States of America files this verified complaint in rem against 39.89138522 bitcoin seized from Exodus wallet … that is now located and in the custody and management of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Dallas Division.At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is around $56,318.06 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. The amount seized totals almost $2.247 million.The seizure took place on Aug. 3. While the FBI did not reveal how it gained access to the wallet, the court document explains that the wallet contained Revil ransom payments belonging to an affiliate identified as Aleksandr Sikerin (aka Alexander Sikerin and Oleksandr Sikerin), whose email address is engfog1337@gmail.com.According to Bleeping Computer, the name “engfog” in the email address is tied to a well-known Gandcrab and Revil/Sodinokibi affiliate known as “Lalartu.”Gandcrab and Revil organizations operated as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), where core operators partner with third-party hackers, known as affiliates, the news outlet noted, adding that ransom payments are split between the affiliate and core operators. The operators usually earn between 20% and 30% of the ransom.Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it had seized $6.1 million from Yevgeniy Polyanin, a Russian “charged with deploying Sodinokibi/Revil ransomware to attack businesses and government entities in the United States.”Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been increasing its efforts to fight ransomware attacks. The Treasury Department has already sanctioned two cryptocurrency exchanges tied to ransom payments.What do you think about the FBI seizing bitcoin tied to ransomware attacks?

286,"Elizabeth Warren Queries Bitcoin Mining Operation, US Senator Says Crypto Miners Raise Environmental Concerns","Dec 3, 2021","Senator Elizabeth Warren has written a letter to the CEO of the New York bitcoin mining firm Greenidge Generation, Jeff Kirt, asking for details on the company’s emissions. Warren’s letter insists “Greenidge and other [bitcoin mining] plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment.”The former law professor and the United States Democratic Party senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, has taken aim at cryptocurrency mining operations after she criticized digital currency markets in recent times. In mid-September, Warren pressed the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate increasing digital currency oversight. Warren has also denounced cryptocurrency mining in the past and she has cited bitcoin mining’s environmental impact on many occasions.On December 2, Warren shared a letter she sent to the CEO of the New York bitcoin mining firm Greenidge Generation Holdings, Jeff Kirt, with the news publication Bloomberg. “Given the extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with bitcoin mining, mining operations at Greenidge and other plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment, on local ecosystems, and on consumer electricity costs,” Warren’s letter explains. The U.S. senator also tweeted the Bloomberg article via her official Twitter account and further said:Crypto mining has huge environmental costs & is raising energy prices for consumers. Bitcoin alone consumes as much energy as Washington state. I’m calling on Bitcoin company [Greenidge Generation] to provide information on its operations & environmental impact.According to Bloomberg’s contributing author, Josh Saul, this “is the first time Warren has queried a specific miner.” The Massachusetts senator further told Bloomberg that lawmakers need to understand these mining facilities more. “We need to better understand how much energy facilities like Greenidge are using, how much they’re emitting into the environment, and what impact they’re having on electricity prices for American consumers,” Warren stressed.The bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation has claimed on many occasions that the company leverages green solutions to mine bitcoin (BTC). The Greenidge Generation power plant in Dresden, NY uses “natural gas to generate electricity.” Furthermore, “Greenidge Generation runs at new levels of thermodynamic efficiency, achieving historic lows in the cost of producing power,” the company details.Greenidge is operated by Atlas Holdings, and the firm’s website explains that the firm purchases carbon offset credits. A number of other bitcoin mining operations also leverage carbon credit solutions and renewable energy solutions.What do you think about the senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, criticizing the bitcoin mining industry and sending a letter to the Greenidge CEO?

287,Jurors in Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Trial Deadlocked for Days — Hung Jury Could Lead to Mistrial,"Dec 2, 2021","Jurors in the Kleiman v. Wright trial are currently unable to come to a decision on the high-profile billion-dollar bitcoin lawsuit in Florida. While the judge has told the jury to take time deliberating the case, on Wednesday, the jurors issued a statement that explained they could not “come to a conclusion.”Following the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, jurors from the Kleiman v. Wright case have been deliberating on their decision for quite some time now. Some believe the jury may end up deadlocked and the case may lead to a mistrial. Court reporter Carolina Bolada from Law360 tweeted on December 2, 2021, that everyone at the courthouse was simply waiting for the decision.“I’ve had a few requests for updates on Kleiman v. Wright,” Bolada tweeted on Thursday. “Believe me, if there were news, I would’ve tweeted it. We are all just waiting around for word from the jury.” The day prior on Wednesday afternoon, Bolada explained that the jurors gave a statement, which said:Unfortunately, we cannot come to a conclusion and we cannot all agree on a verdict on any of the questions.“Not a hung jury yet, but this isn’t looking good for a verdict,” Bolada further detailed after sharing the statement from the jury’s note. “The parties and the court are debating whether to issue an Allen charge to the jurors,” she added.Judge Beth Bloom did end up issuing an Allen charge and said: “I suggest that you now carefully reexamine and reconsider all the evidence in light of the court’s instructions on the law.”If the jury cannot come to a verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial, and a new trial must occur with a new set of jurors. The judgment, if the plaintiffs won, is massive in terms of monetary value as estimates say it could be anywhere between $70 billion to “close to a trillion-dollar judgment.”With the Allen charge, the judicial jury has extended deliberation time, and if the group cannot come to a decision it will end up being a hung jury and Judge Beth Bloom will have to decide again whether they should deliberate further. Traditionally, the push to deliberate further is not usually chosen more than twice. At the end of the day on Thursday, Law360’s Carolina Bolada wrote:No verdict. The jury has asked to come back tomorrow. I am so ready for this to be over.What do you think about the Kleiman v. Wright trial? Do you think it could end up being a mistrial?

288,Monster-Sized Bitcoin Whale Transfers: Blockchain Parser Catches Significant Amounts of ‘Cold BTC’ Moved to Active Exchanges,"Dec 2, 2021","Two days ago on November 30, the price of bitcoin (BTC) tapped a high that day reaching $59,250 per unit, but it has since dropped close to 5% in value to just above the $56K region. Onchain statistics indicate that whales and long-term holders (LTHs) have been spending over the last month and blockchain parsers have witnessed enormous movements in recent days.On the first two days of December, there have been some massive bitcoin (BTC) whale movements stemming from long-term bitcoin holders. On Thursday morning, the creator of the web portal Btcparser.com explained that “significant amounts of bitcoin were taken out from cold wallets and moved to active exchanges.”The onchain action was caught by the blockchain parsing tool Btcparser 3, a tool that analyzes each and every new bitcoin block by getting detailed information about all transactions within it. “The bot uses groups of 100 blocks and identifies all wallets that sent or received a total exceeding 1,000 bitcoins during that time,” explains the parsing tool’s website.On December 1, Btcparser 3 caught some major onchain action, which saw the movement of thousands of bitcoins during the course of the day. For instance, on Wednesday the parser caught the movement of 15,074 BTC or $849 million, 6,970 BTC moved, and thousands more BTC spent as well.Then the following day on December 2, monster-sized bitcoin transactions were caught by Btcparser 3. This transaction on Thursday saw a whopping 36,645 BTC deposited and 10,547 BTC left the wallet. That’s more than $2 billion worth of bitcoin in USD value, and the address spent more than $28.2 billion in bitcoin (BTC) during its lifetime. At 1:59 a.m. (EST) on Thursday, Btcparser 3 caught 15,074 BTC or $849 million move.In addition to Btcparser 3 catching two days worth of major whale movements, Glassnode’s most recent insights report, “Week Onchain 48,” establishes that long-term holders (LTHs) are “spending some of their holdings.” Glassnode’s report notes that this action has been prominent during the last 30 days.“Shifting our focus to [LTHs],” Glassnode’s report details. “We can see that there has been a reasonably continuous rate of spending over the last month. From the peak of 13.5M BTC in holdings, LTHs have spent (assumed distributed) 150K BTC, equivalent to around 5.8% of the volume accumulated since March 2021.”Crypto advocates have been discussing major whale movements on forums and bitcoin whale commentary is littered all over social media. The crypto analytics firm Santiment also tweeted about this past month’s whale action on November 23.“Bitcoin’s key active whale addresses that hold between 100 to 10K BTC are content after accumulating a total of ~40K more BTC on last week’s dip,” Santiment said. The company also shared its weekly report as well, which discusses whale action and “ the growing bearish sentiment (& why it’s a good thing).”What do you think about the recent bitcoin price action, whale movements and the current bearish sentiment?

While bitcoin dominance has slid below the 40% zone, ethereum’s market dominance, or $557 billion market valuation, represents close to 20% of the crypto economy.During the last two weeks, ethereum (ETH) has increased 10.8% in fiat value and year-to-date (YTD), ETH is up 668%. The YTD ether gains are much larger than bitcoin’s (BTC) 190% 12-month increase. At the time of writing, there is $31 billion in global ETH trade volume and ethereum has a market capitalization of around $557 billion. While BTC commands a 38.7% dominance rating, 19.9% belongs to ethereum, and the remainder is held by the 11,289 crypto assets in existence today.The top trading pair with ethereum is the stablecoin tether (USDT) as it commands 44.6% of all ether swaps. This is followed by USD (21.33%), BTC (9.69%), BUSD (8.37%), EUR (4.18%), KRW (2.56%), and JPY (1.69%). Over the last 24 hours of ETH trading, Binance has been the most active trading platform followed by Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, Luno, and Bitfinex. Onchain metrics from Into the Block crypto analytics indicate that holders making money at current ETH prices is around 99% today.Statistics show that concentration by large ethereum holders is 42% in contrast to the 11% concentration by large bitcoin holders. 59% of ETH holders have held for a year or more while 32% have held for a month to 12 months. Only 9% of ETH holders today have held for less than a month according to onchain metrics.

Just over 20% of the ether supply is held by institutional investors and 57.89% or 68 million ether belongs to retail investors.Total exchange inflow last week was $8.22 billion while exchange outflow was $8.86 billion in ether. Ethereum saw a 13.45% increase in new addresses this past week and a 9.95% increase in active addresses.Since March 2016, Ethereum’s hashrate has increased from 1.5 terahash (TH/s) to 956.25 TH/s at the time of writing. ETH’s hashrate has increased, following the rise in price, by a whopping 63,233% since 2016.

290,Bitcoin.com Unlocks Earn on Crypto,"Dec 1, 2021","Bitcoin.com is integrating technology from CoinFLEX that enables users to earn interest on a wide range of cryptoassets, including a US-dollar stablecoin (flexUSD), through both passive and active strategies.The passive yield strategy is built on flexUSD, a US-dollar pegged cryptocurrency that automatically provides all holders with compounding interest payments, regardless of where they hold it.“We’re incredibly excited to be offering an interest-earning product that’s easy to use and carries minimal risk,” said Bitcoin.com CEO Dennis Jarvis. “Now our users can not only shield themselves from the downside market volatility by trading into a US dollar equivalent, they can also earn yield on those dollars that far exceeds anything available in legacy banking.”To start earning interest now, Bitcoin.com users can either swap into or “mint” flexUSD in a few clicks.Behind the scenes, yield for flexUSD is generated by fees and interest paid on short-term lend/borrow markets. Interest rates will vary but are usually between 10-20%. FlexUSD can also be used as collateral to trade, meaning you can earn yield and trade at the same time.The CoinFLEX technology integration also brings advanced trading tools and products to the Bitcoin.com ecosystem, including physically settled futures and perpetuals with leverage up to 100x. These features are available on the Bitcoin.com Exchange, where users can also trade 40+ spot pairs: all the majors like Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH), as well as DeFi coins like UNI and SUSHI, popular meme coins like SHIB, and a range of other coins we’ve never offered before.Bitcoin.com users can also employ active yield strategies by providing liquidity in both single and dual asset pools for futures markets.CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb explains: “The system democratizes access to the yields generated by market making for futures markets, where volumes vastly exceed spot. And since it’s a hybrid model, where the liquidity is decentralized but the order book is centralized, liquidity provision and trades are executed instantly and fees are minimal.”Bitcoin.com traders can use a handy APR Simulator tool to easily estimate the yield generated by supplying liquidity into a given pool and at a defined trading price range. “Beyond providing folks who want to trade at higher frequency with the advanced tools they need, Bitcoin.com now enables holders of cryptoassets to put them to productive use and earn a yield for doing so,” adds Bitcoin.com CEO Dennis Jarvis. “It’s a big step in expanding the Bitcoin.com ecosystem towards our goal of providing an even more comprehensive financial services platform that further supports economic freedom.”

The funding round was led by U.S.-based 10T and Tribe Capital, with the participation of other new investors. 2TM, one of the biggest fintech conglomerates in Latin America, has raised $50 million in an expansion of its Series B funding round. The second closing of the round was led by 10T and Tribe Capital and had participation from other parties, including Traders Club, Pipo Capital, and Endeavor.The first closure of the funding round was in July when it received $200 million from Softbank. 2TM is the holding company of Mercado Bitcoin, one of the leading crypto markets in Brazil, and it’s now seeking to expand its services to other countries on the continent. The entrance of companies like 10T, which is making its first investment in the region, could signal that there is still interest in the growth potential of Latam-based markets when it comes to digital assets.Roberto Dagnoni, CEO of 2TM, stated the company’s priority will be to reach Mexican, Argentinian, Chilean, and Colombian markets in the near future.2TM has experienced notable growth this year, with trading volumes between January and October being double those Mercado Bitcoin recorded from its inception in 2013 to December 2020. About Mercado Bitcoin’s growth, Dagnoni stressed:We have grown to more than 3.2 million customers today, which is equivalent to 80% of individual accounts at the Brazilian Stock exchange. This growth reinforces Brazilians’ appetite for digital assets and the great transformation that is hitting the traditional financial market.2TM has also diversified its investments, positioning itself as a bridge company between the digital asset and the traditional finance markets. This ostensibly puts it in a place to serve traditional investors and institutions that want to dabble in the crypto market, while still aiming to reach the retail investor interested in digital assets.What do you think about 2TM raising $50 million more to expand in Latam markets?

294,Plan B Says Bitcoin Price Still 'on Track Towards $100K' Despite Missing November's Price Prediction,"Nov 29, 2021","This month, the price of bitcoin sank below the $60K zone this month after reaching an all-time high (ATH) at $69K per unit. The pseudonymous bitcoin analyst and the creator of the bitcoin price model called stock-to-flow (S2F), Plan B, called the last three months of bitcoin prices correctly but the analyst’s “worst-case scenario” forecast missed the mark in November. Despite the recent bitcoin price drop, Plan B still seems confident bitcoin’s price is “on track towards $100K.” The infamous pseudonymous bitcoin analyst Plan B is well respected among bitcoiners and has amassed 1.5 million Twitter followers since October 2017. Plan B is the creator of the popular bitcoin price model called stock-to-flow (S2F), which quantifies the commodity’s (bitcoin) scarcity and then divides it by yearly issuance (the flow). The analyst has done well as far as bitcoin (BTC) price predictions are concerned, but this month one of his calls missed.It started four months ago when Plan B tweeted about his “worst-case scenario for 2021” forecast in June. Plan B stated that he believed BTC prices would be “Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K” in the worst-case scenario.So far three out of four of his monthly price predictions have come to fruition and Plan B was also correct when he said: “$64K was not the top.” The miss this month was the first time Plan B’s prediction has been off so far as the call for November had a $98K target. Plan B acknowledged that his prediction missed this month as bitcoin (BTC) prices slid under the $60K zone following the recent $69K ATH. “Floor model $98K [November] close will probably be a first miss (after nailing Aug, Sep, Oct). S2F model not affected and indeed on track towards $100K,” Plan B stressed to his 1.5 million followers on November 25.More than 39,000 accounts on Twitter liked the tweet and it was shared close to 5,000 times. Correctly forecasting three out of four predictions is very good and Plan B’s followers are curious about what the price will be for the month of December. Two days later, the pseudonymous bitcoin analyst tweeted about the crypto asset’s relative strength index (RSI). “Bitcoin RSI 66 and 10% below monthly close ATH,” Plan B said. The following day, Plan B noted that “bitcoin has better risk-adjusted returns than all other assets.” The analyst also created a poll, which has 18 hours left, but so far has received 142,490 votes. The poll asks if $69K was the top for this halving cycle or if the price of bitcoin (BTC) will exceed the $69K ATH reached on November 10. Stats from Plan B’s poll indicate that at the time of writing, 78.4% think BTC’s price will surpass $69K while 21.6% voted that “$69K was the top.”What do you think about Plan B missing the November prediction but correctly forecasting the last three months prior? Do you think bitcoin is headed for $100K or do you think $69K was the top? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Meanwhile, the winter session of parliament has begun and a crypto bill is expected to be taken up during this session.On Monday, the Indian Ministry of Finance answered three sets of questions on bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading in Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament.The first set of questions (Starred Question No. 12), titled “Bitcoin Transactions,” ask Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman “whether the government is aware that bitcoin transaction is silently blooming in India in the recent years.” The finance minister replied:The government does not collect data on bitcoin transactions.Finance Minister Sitharaman was further asked “whether the government has any proposal to recognize bitcoin as a currency in the country.” She simply replied: “No, sir.”The second set of questions (Unstarred Question No. 196) are about the high-profile “Bitcoin Scam in Karnataka,” which recently received heavy media coverage. The case was even brought up by Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The finance minister was asked about the scam and details of the investigation and action being taken.The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, Shri Pankaj Chaudhary, replied: “Information in public domain suggests that a case of cybercrime involving bitcoin has been under examination by the Karnataka police … However, a case has also been registered by Bangalore Zonal Unit of the Directorate of Enforcement. Further disclosure of information in the matter is not in larger public interest.”The third set of questions (Unstarred Question No. 173), titled “Cryptocurrency,” ask the finance minister “whether the government is aware of the cryptocurrencies that are traded in India.” Minister Chaudhary responded:Government does not collect information on trading in cryptocurrency.The finance minister was also asked whether cryptocurrency trading is permitted in India and whether crypto exchanges are legal entities in the country. In addition, she was asked to detail any Acts applicable to cryptocurrency and crypto exchanges.Minister Chaudhary replied: “Cryptocurrencies are unregulated in India. RBI [the Reserve Bank of India] has vide its circular dated May 31st, 2021, advised its regulated entities to continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with regulations governing standards for know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), combating of financing of terrorism (CFT) and obligations of regulated entities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002 in addition to ensuring compliance with relevant provisions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for overseas remittances.”The winter session of parliament commenced on Monday.

296,Bank of England Governor Worried About Bitcoin Being Legal Tender in El Salvador,"Nov 28, 2021","The governor of the Bank of England, the country’s central bank, has voiced concerns about El Salvador choosing bitcoin as a national currency. Citing a recent warning by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) against bitcoin’s use as legal tender, the governor said: “What would worry me most of all is, do the citizens of El Salvador understand the nature and volatility of the currency they have.”Bank of England (BOE) Governor Andrew Bailey raised concerns about bitcoin being used as legal tender in El Salvador while speaking at the Cambridge University student union Thursday. Bailey explained:It concerns me that a country would choose it as its national currency … What would worry me most of all is, do the citizens of El Salvador understand the nature and volatility of the currency they have.El Salvador passed a bitcoin law making the cryptocurrency legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in September.Governor Bailey added that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not happy that El Salvador has made BTC legal tender.The IMF told El Salvador last week that bitcoin “should not be used as a legal tender.” Citing “bitcoin’s high price volatility,” the Fund stated that the use of BTC “as a legal tender entails significant risks to consumer protection, financial integrity, and financial stability.” In addition, “Its use also gives rise to fiscal contingent liabilities.”The IMF’s warning came one day after El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, announced a plan to build the world’s first “bitcoin city” powered by a volcano and financed by bitcoin bonds.Despite the IMF’s warning, El Salvador bought 100 more bitcoins, taking advantage of Friday’s crypto sell-offs following reports of a new Covid-19 variant.Governor Bailey also commented on the Bank of England’s work to determine whether to issue its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). He emphasized:There is a strong case for digital currencies, but in our view it has to be stable, particularly if it’s being used for payments. That is not true for crypto assets.The Salvadoran president responded to the concerns raised by the governor of the Bank of England via Twitter Saturday.He wrote: “Bank of England is ‘worried’ about El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin? Really? I guess Bank of England’s interest in the well-being of our people is genuine. Right? I mean, they have always cared about our people. Always. Gotta love Bank of England.” Bukele further tweeted:I’m really concerned about Bank of England printing money out of thin air.What do you think about Andrew Bailey’s comments?

The report covers crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), and recent findings show alternative crypto asset investment products are outperforming Bitcoin ETPs. Every month Cryptocompare publishes a research report that covers the cryptocurrency investment product landscape. The investment products are ETPs tethered to today’s top crypto assets globally such as Grayscale’s GBTC and ETHE funds. Cryptocompare’s Digital Asset Management Review November report explains that ETPs tied to ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), and solana (SOL) saw better returns during a 30-day time frame ending on November 19.“The majority of AUM for trust products continues to reside in Grayscale’s Bitcoin (GBTC – $38.1bn – down 10.1% since October) and Ethereum (ETHE – $12.9bn– up 3.6%) products,” Cryptocompare’s report discloses. “ETC Group’s BTCE product regained the position of highest AUM ETN/ETF product with a gain of 1.2% to $1.5bn. This was followed by Purpose’s Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) and 3iQ Coinshares’ Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ) which fell 6.5% and 10.1% to $1.4bn and $1.2bn respectively,” the Cryptocompare researchers add.The research highlights that overall, crypto-based ETP daily volumes slid by 13% but popular ETH-based ETP volume rose. “Average daily trading volumes across all digital asset investment product types fell by an average of 13% from October to $732mn/day,” the study highlights. Cryptocompare’s report notes that Bitcoin-based investment products “performed poorly,” while LTC and SOL-based ETPs did well. Grayscale’s basket fund which contains some of the largest market cap coins returned -15.5%, Cryptocompare detailed.“BTC-based investment products generally saw negative returns in November, led by ETC Group’s BTCE product which returned -13.1%. Similarly, Grayscale’s GBTC trust returned -10.2%,” Cryptocompare’s November study explains. “The best performing investment product was Valour’s BTCZERO product, which returned -6.6%.

299,El Salvador Buys 100 More Bitcoins Amid Crypto Sell-Offs and New Covid-19 Variant Scare,"Nov 27, 2021","As reports of a new Covid-19 strain spread, tanking the price of many cryptocurrencies, El Salvador bought the dip. The country has added 100 more bitcoins to its treasury despite a recent warning by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), bringing the total number of bitcoins purchased to 1,220.El Salvador has taken advantage of the Friday sell-off and purchased 100 more bitcoins as reports of a new coronavirus variant spread. The Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted on Black Friday that his country has bought the dip. “100 extra coins acquired with a discount,” he wrote.An advisory panel of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday classified the new Covid-19 variant, first detected in South Africa, as a highly transmissible virus, naming it “Omicron.”The crypto market shed billions of dollars on Friday amid reports of the new coronavirus strain. The price of bitcoin fell from $59,165 Thursday afternoon to $53,798 Friday afternoon. BTC is trading at $54,830.98 per coin at the time of writing based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar on Sept. 7. At the time, the price of BTC was approximately $46,000.Since bitcoin became legal tender, El Salvador has purchased 1,220 BTC altogether, according to announcements by Bukele.The day before the country’s bitcoin law went into effect, El Salvador purchased two sets of 200 bitcoins. It bought 150 BTC more on Sept. 7 and 150 more coins on Sept. 20. Bukele said at the time, “El Salvador now holds 700 coins.”Since then, El Salvador bought 420 more coins on Oct. 27, bringing the total purchase to 1,120 coins. Friday’s purchase pushes the country’s bitcoin stash to 1,220 coins. At the current price, 1,220 bitcoins are worth approximately $66.9 million.President Bukele announced last week a plan to build the world’s first “bitcoin city” powered by a volcano and financed by bitcoin bonds. He noted there would not be any taxes in the bitcoin city except for value-added tax (VAT).However, a day after the announcement, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the country against using BTC as legal tender. The IMF cited “significant risks to consumer protection, financial integrity, and financial stability” as the reasons, adding that it “also gives rise to fiscal contingent liabilities.”What do you think about El Salvador buying the dip amid crypto market sell-offs as a new Covid-19 strain emerged?

300,'We’ve All Decided Centralized Banking Is Rigged' — South Park Episode Features a Bitcoin-Only Future,"Nov 27, 2021","South Park’s recent episode called the “Post COVID” special mocks a future where the only currency accepted is bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The hour-long animated sitcom picks up years into the future where the main characters are now all grown up, except Kenny McCormick who is dead.The popular television sitcom South Park featured on Comedy Central is extremely well known in today’s pop culture ever since Trey Parker and Matt Stone created the show in 1997. Over the last 24 years, the animated sitcom has aired more than 300 episodes and in more recent times, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick have been dealing with an interesting world. In the latest episode called “Post COVID,” Stan, who is now an online whiskey consultant, is told by Kyle that Kenny had passed away.When Stan decides to go to Kenny’s funeral services, he spends his stay at the Super 12 Motel Plus and is greeted by a clerk who explains Stan booked one of the motel’s Mach 10 Super Plus rooms. “Now of course we only take bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” the motel clerk says to Stan. “Because… ya know — It’s the future — we’ve all decided centralized banking is rigged so we trust more in fly-by-night Ponzi schemes,” the Super 12 Motel Plus clerk added. “Yeah, I know,” Stan sighs and hands the clerk a card bearing the bitcoin logo on it with a QR code.Bitcoin has been featured in a number of television series’ episodes during the last decade and in various settings. This year bitcoin was mentioned on Marvel Cinematic Universe’s action drama television show “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.” Bitcoin has been featured on the American comedy-drama series “Shameless” on multiple occasions. The leading crypto asset was also mentioned on two occasions on the American television game show Jeopardy.Before South Park, bitcoin appeared on the shows “Parks and Recreation,” “Mr. Robot,” “Morgan Spurlock Inside Man,” “Navy CIS LA,” “Almost Human,” “House of Cards,” and “The Big Bang Theory.” Bitcoin’s first mention on television was on an episode of “The Good Wife” in 2012 and Krusty the Clown from “The Simpsons” mentioned the cryptocurrency the following year.What do you think about South Park mocking a bitcoin-only world in the latest episode?

301,Data Shows a Myriad of Crypto Networks Are More Profitable to Mine Than Bitcoin,"Nov 27, 2021","As the end of the year approaches, digital currency values have risen a great deal in 2021 and crypto asset miners have been profiting as a result. According to statistics, the most profitable coin to mine at the end of November is kadena, as an 18 terahash (TH/s) machine can get up to $326 per day. Scrypt coins are the second most profitable these days with up to $110 per day and Ethash miners can make up to $105 per day.Close to 13 years ago when Bitcoin first launched, the cryptocurrency could be mined with a central processing unit (CPU). This means that anyone with a decent computer at the time could mine and find bitcoin (BTC) block rewards. After that phase, people started to leverage devices with specialized electronic circuits called graphics processing units (GPUs).Today, bitcoin miners utilize application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices to mine BTC. Bitcoin mining rigs dedicate processing power to the SHA256 algorithm and this means a bitcoin ASIC mining device cannot mine coins like ethereum, litecoin, or kadena.Those networks leverage different consensus algorithms and there’s a slew of machines manufactured to mine specific crypto asset networks with unique consensus algorithms. SHA256 is a consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin, but SHA256 miners can also mine coins like bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoinsv (BSV), peercoin (PPC), and unbreakable (UNB).SHA256 cryptocurrencies are the fifth most profitable to mine at the end of November 2021. The top four most profitable consensus algorithms to mine today include Kadena, Scrypt, Ethash, and Eaglesong.A Kadena-based ASIC miner can get up to $326 per day with 18 TH/s at $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh), according to asicminervalue.com stats. A Scrypt-based miner with 9.5 gigahash per second (GH/s) can get $110 per day with the same electrical costs.750 megahash per second (MH/s) ASIC machines mining the algorithm Ethash (ethereum, ethereum classic, pirl) can get up to $52 per day. Eaglesong-based mining rigs that mine nervos (CKB) can get $45 per day with 12 TH/s.There are also consensus algorithms such as Blake2bsia, X11, Blake256R14, and Equihash. Blake2bsia compatible mining rigs mine sia (SIA) and handshake (HNS), while X11 compatible rigs mine dash (DASH) and cannabiscoin (CANN). Blake256R14 mines decred (DCR) while Equihash-based machines can mine zcash (ZEC), hush (HUSH), and zencash (ZEN).SHA256 miners mining bitcoin (BTC) with around 100 TH/s at $0.12 per kWh, can get up to $27 per day mining. The top bitcoin miners process at speeds up to 100 TH/s but SHA256 miners with at least 11.5 TH/s can turn a small profit. During the next few months, a number of next-generation miners are slated to launch.Upcoming mining rig releases that pack a lot more hashpower will be dedicated to consensus algorithms like Ethash and SHA256, according to a few prior announcements. For instance, in July 2022, Bitmain is expected to release the Antminer S19 XP (140 TH/s) and Innosilicon’s A11 Pro ETH (2,000 MH/s) is reportedly coming soon as well.What do you think about the top consensus algorithms today and the profits these networks can obtain?

302,"Bitcoin's Hashrate Dips, Mining Difficulty Expected to Decrease for First Time Since July","Nov 27, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has been volatile in recent times following the same patterns as the crypto asset’s price. Three days ago, Bitcoin’s hashrate neared the 180 exahash (EH/s) zone only to plummet to 128 EH/s two days later. The recent shifts have taken place before the upcoming network difficulty adjustment, which is due to change on Sunday. After nine increases in a row and for the first time since mid-July, the difficulty will drop lower instead of increasing.The fiat value of bitcoin (BTC) has caused the network’s processing power to slow down toward the end of November. Seven days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on how Bitcoin’s hashrate was steadily climbing higher during the last three months. Today, BTC’s hashrate is coasting along at 168 EH/s after reaching a high of 178 EH/s on November 24. After reaching that high on Wednesday, on Friday the hashrate dropped to a low of 128 EH/s, losing 28% in 48 hours.The slow down is causing the network difficulty to stay lower than usual and this Sunday it’s expected to drop for the first time since July 17, 2021. After the mid-July difficulty change, BTC’s difficulty increased nine times in a row.It is now 52.48% harder to mine BTC than it was 133 days ago on July 17. The next change, which is slated to happen during the early morning hours (EST) on Sunday, is expected to slide by -0.38%. It’s not much but it will deter the mining difficulty from reaching its all-time high (ATH).There’s also been a lot of changes in terms of hashrate distribution among mining pools. Bitmain’s Antpool is the largest bitcoin miner today with 16.79% of the network or 26.15 EH/s in hashrate. Foundry USA is the second-largest bitcoin mining pool with 16.55% of the network’s hashpower, or 25.77 EH/s. While F2pool holds the third position with 15.33% of the hashpower, or 23.87 EH/s, unknown hashrate or stealth miners command 13.14% of the network’s hashpower or just over 20 EH/s.Bitcoin’s mining difficulty recorded an ATH on May 13, 2021, when it reached 25.05 trillion. Today, the network difficulty is 22.67 trillion and the decrease should bring it down to 22.59 trillion by Sunday, November 28, 2021. The 0.38% change is minuscule compared to most difficulty shifts but it will keep the difficulty lower for another two weeks which is helpful to miners while the price of BTC is much lower than it was two weeks ago. Bitcoin’s difficulty increased by 4.69% two weeks ago, four days after BTC reached a price ATH at $69K per unit.What do you think about the upcoming difficulty decrease and the recent hashrate action?

304,Jury to Decide Fate of Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Lawsuit Involving Craig Wright,"Nov 25, 2021","On Tuesday, November 23, the closing arguments for both sides of the Kleiman v. Wright trial finished and now ten jurors will decide the fate of the billion-dollar bitcoin lawsuit. While Craig Wright claims he’s Satoshi Nakamoto, he also insists the now-deceased Dave Kleiman did not help with the creation of Bitcoin. The plaintiffs are hoping to win an incredibly large sum of money and intellectual property (IP) estimated to be worth billions of dollars.The infamous Kleiman v. Wright trial is nearing its end and the cryptocurrency community is about to witness the long-awaited decision stemming from a jury in Miami, Florida. The plaintiffs’ attorney representing the Kleiman estate, Vel Freedman, tweeted about the case when the closing arguments were finished and the jury left to make a decision. “Kleiman v Wright update: Case submitted to the jury. Closings done. Now we wait,” Freedman explained on Tuesday afternoon (EST).Freedman further thanked some of the colleagues that helped his law firm with the case. Following the closing arguments, it is now up to the ten jurors to decide. The jurors did not come to a conclusion on Tuesday and the court jurors will reconvene again on Monday. Coingeek’s Kurt Wuckert Jr. tweeted about the case and complemented Freedman after the closing arguments.“Vel Freedman had a very strong finish for Kleiman today,” Wuckert Jr. said. “Rivero accidentally spilled his water on his notes and struggled with technical difficulties. He caught his stride, and made his points, but Freedman had a very direct and effective finish. Jury in deliberation now.”Various estimates note that the lawsuit’s judgment could lead to a massively sized order if the plaintiffs win. Coingeek’s contributing writer Jordan Atkins estimates the judgment could see the Kleiman estate “entitled to a portion of a bitcoin fortune worth more than US$70 billion.” The Coindesk author Deirdra Funcheon projects the judgment could be around: “$36 billion (the value of bitcoin at issue)” and “$126 billion (the value of intellectual property at issue).”Additionally, there’s billions of dollars in potential punitive damages if the Kleiman estate wins. Law360 contributing author, Carolina Bolado, has been covering the case in great detail for Law360 and on her Twitter account as well. “The amount of money the plaintiffs are requesting here is staggering,” Bolado wrote on Twitter. “If they get it all, with treble damages for civil theft and potential punitive damages, we’re looking at close to a trillion dollar judgment. It’s hard to even comprehend.” In a previous tweet Bolado wrote:We’re wrapping up the instructions to the jury now. One interesting note: they need to be unanimous in their decision.In addition to the summaries from Bolado, Funcheon, Wuckert Jr., and Atkins the Twitter accounts Arthur van Pelt (@mylegacykit) and the artist dubbed Fractal Encrypt (@fractalencrypt) have been covering the Kleiman v. Wright trial in great detail as well. While the court’s jurors could not come to a conclusion during the beginning of the week, the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday postponed the final proceedings for six full days.What do you think about the upcoming Kleiman v. Wright proceedings? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

305,Bitcoin Dominance Slides Below 40% for First Time in 6 Months,"Nov 25, 2021","During the last week, the price of bitcoin has been hovering below the $60K range and digital currency advocates are wondering which way the market is headed next. At the time of writing, the crypto economy is valued at $2.81 trillion and bitcoin’s market dominance has sunk below the 40% region for several days now.The price of bitcoin (BTC) reached $69K on November 10, and six days later on the 16th, the price fell below the $60K zone and hasn’t returned above that region since then. Today, according to crypto coin market aggregators there are around 11,117 coins being traded on 525 cryptocurrency exchanges. The value of all more than 11K crypto coins in existence is around $2.81 trillion and it increased in value 3.9% over the last 24 hours.Bitcoin (BTC) has an overall market capitalization of around $1.1 trillion and on Thursday, November 25, BTC dominance is 39.7%. BTC’s dominance has not been this low since mid-May 2021, or around six months ago. The last time it was lower than 40% prior to the mid-May drop was three years ago on June 17, 2018. Statistics from Coingecko.com indicate that the second leading crypto asset, ethereum (ETH), has around 19% of the market dominance on Thursday. Ether has a market valuation of around $525 billion at the time of writing.While ethereum (ETH) has a significant portion of dominance, a slew of other crypto assets in the top 20 positions have also been swelling in value and increasing their own dominance levels. Binance coin (BNB) commands 4.02% of the $2.81 trillion crypto economy and the stablecoin tether (USDT) captures 2.74%. Solana (SOL) has increased in value a great deal this year and currently, SOL commands 2.43% of the crypto economy’s overall value. Cardano (ADA) is another that holds more than 2% as ADA’s market valuation on Thursday is 2.13% of the crypto economy.Only five other crypto assets command more than 1% of the crypto economy’s fiat value and six coins have more than 0.5% of the $2.81 trillion in value. Interestingly, bitcoin (BTC) dominance held above the 60% range for two months this year, but BTC dominance slipped below 60% at the end of February. Another interesting factoid is that BTC dominance held above the 80% region during its whole lifetime (minus a few brief instances) up until the end of February 2017.BTC’s dominance has never returned back above the 80% region but did reach 70% on January 3, 2021, the network’s 12th anniversary. Bitcoin has a lot more competition than it did in the early days, as before 2013 there were only a few hundred competitors. By the time BTC slid below the 80% dominance range in 2017, there were a few thousand alternative digital assets. Still, BTC is holding its own with $1.1 trillion in fiat value while 11,116 crypto assets hold $1.71 trillion in fiat value.What do you think about bitcoin’s dominance sinking below the 40% zone?

The warning came one day after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced his plan to build a “bitcoin city” powered by a volcano and financed by bitcoin bonds.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned El Salvador on Monday that the country should not use bitcoin as legal tender, citing various risks associated with the cryptocurrency.El Salvador is the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar which it has used for two decades. The country’s bitcoin law went into effect in September. Furthermore, El Salvador has purchased 1,120 BTC, according to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.The IMF regularly undertakes Article IV missions to member countries to consult with government officials before they request to use its resources. The IMF explained that for El Salvador, “The adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, the regulation and supervision of bitcoin services providers, and e-wallet Chivo were also discussed.”In its “Staff Concluding Statement of the 2021 Article IV Mission” for El Salvador, the IMF detailed:Given bitcoin’s high price volatility, its use as a legal tender entails significant risks to consumer protection, financial integrity, and financial stability. Its use also gives rise to fiscal contingent liabilities. Because of those risks, bitcoin should not be used as a legal tender.The IMF proceeded to recommend “narrowing the scope of the bitcoin law” and urged El Salvador to strengthen “the regulation and supervision of the new payment ecosystem.”The recent statement from the IMF came one day after President Bukele announced a plan to build the world’s first bitcoin city powered by a volcano and financed by bitcoin bonds. He noted there would not be any taxes in the bitcoin city except for value-added tax (VAT).“The plans to issue sovereign bonds and use the proceeds to buy bitcoin and fund infrastructure plans announced on November 20, occurred after the technical work of the mission concluded, and were not discussed with the authorities,” the IMF clarified.Commenting on the IMF’s statement, Bukele said:Although we obviously do not agree on some things, such as the adoption of bitcoin, the analysis it makes of our country is interesting.What do you think about the IMF advising El Salvador against using bitcoin as legal tender?

The city would also feature zero taxes for its citizens. On this, Bukele stated:Invest here and make all the money you want. This is a fully ecological city that works and is energized by a volcano.The only tax collected in the city would be a value-added tax, that will be used to fund the construction of the city with bonds and to maintain the public infrastructure and services. Bukele offered a glimpse into the design of the Bitcoin City, showing a circular model that will feature a central plaza with the bitcoin symbol.The issuance of the bonds will be managed by Blockstream, a bitcoin services-focused company, with the tokenized bonds being issued on top of its Liquid blockchain, a federated sidechain.

The first part will be used to purchase a $500 million allocation of bitcoin, and the second $500 million will be used to build bitcoin-specific mining and power infrastructure.The tokenized bond will be available to a number of users in the world, that will have access to invest in small amounts of even $100 dollars, according to statements from Blockstream’s CSO Samson Mow. Dividends will be paid easily to bondholders using tools deployed on top of the Liquid network.The country will have to approve a new securities law, and allow Bitfinex, the exchange selected for leading this process, to organize the bond issuance. This is easy for Bukele, because his party, New Ideas, controls most of the legislative power in the country. So, this is just a mere formality in the way of the Bitcoin City proposal.What do you think about El Salvador’s Bitcoin City proposal and the bond issuance to fund it?

315,Microstrategy CEO Discusses Bitcoin Becoming $100 Trillion Asset Class — Says BTC Will Grow 100X,"Nov 20, 2021","The CEO of Microstrategy says that bitcoin will emerge as a $100 trillion asset class and will grow 100X from where it is today. He said the cryptocurrency is winning against gold as a store of value and he is not worried about regulation. “I’m not at all troubled with the regulations that’s going on right now.”Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor talked about the future outlook for bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Friday. He discussed the institutional adoption of bitcoin, crypto regulation, market volatility, gold versus bitcoin, and BTC as the world’s dominant digital asset and safe-haven investment.His company currently hodls 114,042 BTC. He was asked whether he is going to keep stacking bitcoin at the current price or wait for a further pullback. He replied: “We are going to keep stacking forever.”On the topic of bitcoin vs. gold, Saylor was asked whether he thinks “bitcoin has replaced, or will replace, or is in the process of replacing gold as the store of value for most investors.” Noting the advantages of bitcoin over gold, such as the ease of transfer the low storage cost, he said:It’s pretty clear that bitcoin is winning, gold is losing … and it’s going to continue … It’s pretty clear digital gold is going to replace gold this decade.Regarding regulation, including the controversial crypto provision in the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, Saylor said, “I’m not at all troubled with the regulations that’s going on right now.”He explained, “The safe haven for institutions is to use bitcoin as a store of value,” emphasizing that “Bitcoin is the only ethical, technical, and legal safe haven in the entire crypto ecosystem.”The pro-bitcoin Microstrategy boss noted that the crypto regulation that is being discussed in Washington will “have an impact on security tokens, defi [decentralized finance] exchanges, crypto exchanges, all the other use cases of crypto that are not bitcoin.”Saylor was also asked what he expects in terms of a realistic price target for bitcoin and whether he sees BTC being worth $1 million a coin someday. He replied that if bitcoin doubles every year, then:At the end of the decade it will have flipped gold, and then it will flip monetary indexes, a little bit of bonds, a little bit of real estate, a little bit of equity, and emerge as a $100 trillion asset class. So, 100X of where it is right now.He continued: “When we get there, it will be 5% to 7% of the worldwide economy. The U.S. dollar will probably replace 150 currencies. Maybe there will only be 2 to 3 left. There might be the euro, the CNY, and the dollar. Everything else is probably going to disappear. And then bitcoin will be the world’s monetary index. If you simply want to keep your money, and you don’t want to express a credit sentiment, or an equity sentiment, or some property or real estate sentiment.”Lastly, Saylor was asked how countries will react to the scenario he described and whether bitcoin is unstoppable or whether getting to the point he described will depend on governments. He affirmed:I think bitcoin is unstoppable as digital property.He proceeded to explain that there will be three classes of countries. The communist countries, such as North Korea, “will not give you property rights” and “will not let you own anything,” he described, adding that “They will probably ban it.”The second category comprises countries with weak currencies. They “will have capital controls. They will let you own it but they don’t want you to exchange it or trade it,” Saylor noted. He then pointed out: “It’s not illegal to own bitcoin in China. They just don’t want you to move billions of dollars out of their economy.”The third category comprises western nations that have strong currencies, like the U.S. dollar. “Of course, it’s going to be deemed property,” Saylor said. “You will pay capital gains tax when you sell it.”Do you agree with Michael Saylor? Let us know in the comments section below.

Bank of Russia is trying to do that through its projects. “I have already spoken about the digital ruble – in our opinion, this should develop,” Elvira Nabiullina added.The head of Russia’s monetary policy regulator remarked that the CBR is not against digital currencies in general, provided they are not used for “shadow operations.” Nabiullina pointed out, however, that Bank of Russia continues to oppose the legalization of bitcoin as a payment instrument in the country.In response to the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies and the significant increase in electronic payments, the Russian central bank has stepped up its efforts to create a digital version of the national fiat, the ruble. This year, the regulator formed a digital ruble pilot group with over a dozen financial institutions. A prototype of the CBDC platform will be launched in December, with trials scheduled to commence in January.The digital ruble is what the Russians need as it will facilitate cheap and reliable non-cash payments, Nabiullina recently told participants in an international banking forum. According to the country’s latest financial market development strategy, the state-issued digital currency should prevent citizens from using ‘money surrogates,’ a term used by officials in Moscow to describe cryptocurrencies.Do you think Russia will ever legalize bitcoin as a means of payment?

317,"While BTC's Hashrate Climbs Higher, Bitcoin's Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High","Nov 20, 2021","During the last 90 days, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been climbing higher and has been slowly nearing the all-time high (ATH) the network captured six months ago in May. The accelerated hashrate has caused the network difficulty to rise, as Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has adjusted upward nine times in a row to date and it’s closing in on the network difficulty ATH recorded six months ago.Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is approaching the all-time high recorded on May 13, 2021. The network’s difficulty is basically a mechanism Satoshi Nakamoto added to maintain a steady rate of close to ten-minute blocks. Furthermore, the difficulty also makes the entire system stronger security-wise, as a 51% attack becomes a lot more expensive and far more difficult to achieve.When the hashrate changes, every two weeks, the network takes the change into account, and when the hashrate increases the difficulty to mine bitcoin (BTC) also rises. When the hashrate experiences a sudden dive, like it did at the end of June and during the month of July over the bitcoin mining crackdown in China, the difficulty will also lower. When BTC’s hashrate plummeted this year, the network’s mining difficulty slid by 39.8% in different intervals.The difficulty’s ATH on May 13, 2021, was roughly 25.05 trillion, and two weeks later it adjusted down to 21.05 trillion. Following July 3, BTC’s mining difficulty slid to a low of 13.6 trillion after it experienced the largest downward difficulty adjustment in the network’s lifetime. That massive downward drop was approximately 27.94% at block height 689,472. Today, BTC’s mining difficulty is 22.67 trillion and getting awfully close to nearing its 25.05 trillion ATH.The bottom line is bitcoin (BTC) will be more difficult to mine than it was six months ago in a short period of time. The mining difficulty will need to increase by 10.27% from the current position to surpass the May 13 record high. At current SHA256 profitability rates, the odds of BTC’s mining difficulty increasing enough to surpass the difficulty ATH recorded six months ago is far greater. ASIC bitcoin mining rigs such as the Microbt Whatsminer M30S++, Ipollo’s B2, and the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro still make over $25 per day paying $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in electricity costs.What do you think about Bitcoin’s network difficulty nearing the all-time high it recorded in May?

318,"While Speculators Believe Bitcoin's Third-Largest Wallet Is a Mystery Whale, Onchain Data Suggests It's an Exchange","Nov 19, 2021","The price of bitcoin has dipped below the $60K zone, a number of people have been talking about the third-largest bitcoin address called “1P5ZED” which has accumulated thousands of bitcoin during the last few days. Nobody knows who the owner of the wallet is but it holds more than 111,359 bitcoin, as it’s been steadily accruing bitcoin since the wallet’s first transaction on February 5, 2019. While some assume the address is a mega bitcoin whale, onchain data indicates that the wallet could be tied to an exchange. Bitcoin’s fiat value has been volatile and it’s one of those times where everyone is looking for answers to why BTC has slid in value. For instance, on November 10, bitcoin (BTC) slid from a $69K all-time high (ATH) and five days later, it was coasting along in the mid-$65K to $66K per unit range. Since the crypto asset’s ATH, bitcoin is down 16% in value and slid under the $60K zone. Of course, the volatility sparked whale watchers and people talking about bitcoin whale transactions happening in real-time.The third largest Bitcoin whale justbought the dip!- buying atotal of 1.123 BTC (72 MillionUSD) at a price of $64k #BTC #buythedip #cryptobrothers #Ethereum #SHIB #cryptotrading https://t.co/RWA5hIj02A— Crypto Bros. (@CryptoBroUK) November 13, 2021Bitcoin whales are individuals or organizations with large sums of BTC and the whale can also be of various sizes. Depending on who you ask, BTC whales can be individuals or organizations that own 1,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000+ bitcoin. An entity that holds more than 100,000 BTC would be considered a “mega-whale,” and there are only three bitcoin addresses in existence with 100,000 BTC or more. The top five largest BTC wallets hold anywhere between 84K to 288K BTC, and three of those wallets are marked or tagged as exchanges.Lately, crypto publications and a slew of individuals on social media and forums, have been speculating about the actions of the third-largest bitcoin wallet. The conversation has been trending and many people believe that a large whale “bought the dip,” while the price of BTC slipped. Bitcoin.com News has seen a few large whale sightings as well amid BTC hitting fresh new price highs nine days ago. Although the whales our news team discovered stemmed from mined bitcoin block rewards from over a decade ago.The third-largest bitcoin (BTC) address was first created on February 5, 2019, when it received a small fraction of BTC. Seven days later, onchain data shows the wallet obtained 1,119 BTC on February 12, 2019. The wallet address “1P5ZED” doesn’t look like an individual bitcoin holder and the transactions 1P5ZED has processed look more like exchange activity from a crypto trading platform. As mentioned above, three out of the top five BTC addresses are flagged as being associated with cold wallets belonging to Binance, Bitfinex, and Okex.1P5ZED has all the tell-tale signs of being associated with an exchange and it’s not known for sure, but it’s been flagged on a few occasions. The address has received a lot of BTC during the last two years and occasionally it spends BTC as well. 1P5ZED’s transactions have very little privacy according to statistics from blockchair.com, as the block explorers privacy tool indicates most of its transactions are done with a very low preference for privacy. Most of 1P5ZED’s transactions have a “critical” to “low” privacy rating in terms of the level of traceability. The transactions suffer from vulnerabilities such as matched addresses and inputs and outputs that are often similar.#Bitcoin 's third largest non-exchange whale address (1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ) has bought a total of 3038 BTC in batches for four consecutive days since the 16th, with an average price of approximately $59744.22Source👇https://t.co/NwewDCXXqr— CoinCarp (@coincarpcom) November 19, 2021On the block explorer oxt.me, the address 1P5ZED has notes associated with it, which explain that the address could be tied to an exchange. The first annotation on oxt.me about 1P5ZED says it was submitted by a person named “TEJAS” on November 22, 2020. The individual writes it “could be Bittrex” and also leaves a link in the annotation as well. The article linked references a 717 BTC transfer that was allegedly carried out between Bittrex and 1P5ZED.The second annotation on the block explorer oxt.me was added by “ERGOBTC” on July 14, 2020. The note says the “address source suggests Gemini or Coinbase.” This led our investigation down to parsing 1P5ZED’s transactions during the last two months. Blockchain parsing data shows that 1P5ZED transacts quite a bit with the BTC wallet address known as “1FzWLk.” While 1FzWLk transacts with 1P5ZED a lot, 1FzWLk is also flagged with a note on oxt.me about the address being associated with an exchange.The 1FzWLk annotation was also submitted by ERGOBTC, on the same day the second annotation was applied to 1P5ZED. “[1FzWLk] annotated as Okex by Whale Alerts. Though source and cluster spending suggest closer ties to Coinbase and Gemini,” annotation details. While it’s not certain 1P5ZED (which acts like an exchange cold wallet) and 1FzWLk (which acts more like a hot wallet) belong to a trading platform, there’s a lot more supporting evidence that shows 1P5ZED is likely owned by an exchange.Do you think 1P5ZED is a random whale address or do you think it belongs to an exchange?

It is important that all democratic nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth,” Modi said.In addition, the prime minister urged Australia and India’s partners in the Indo-Pacific region “and beyond” to invest together in future technologies to “deepen intelligence and operational cooperation and develop common standards for data governance and cross border flow of data.”Modi explained that the digital age is changing everything. Besides redefining politics, economies, and societies, it has raised new questions on sovereignty, governance, ethics, rights, and security.The prime minister’s statement on cryptocurrency and bitcoin came after he reportedly chaired a comprehensive meeting on the subject following a consultation with the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Finance, and the Home Ministry.This week, India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance also held a meeting with representatives from the crypto industry.

324,Famed Economist Doubts Bitcoin Will Become Global Currency,"Nov 17, 2021","Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services company Allianz, says that bitcoin is not going to be a global currency and will not replace the U.S. dollar. However, he believes the cryptocurrency will always exist in the ecosystem and will not be regulated out of existence.Famed economist Mohamed El-Erian talked about the future outlook for cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, in an interview with CNBC Monday.El-Erian is the chief economic advisor at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO, one of the largest investment managers, where he was CEO and co-chief investment officer. The Egyptian-American businessman is also president of Queens College, Cambridge University.While El-Erian believes that bitcoin is a “very disruptive force,” he does not think it will ever become a “global currency” that rivals the U.S. dollar. He said:I think it will always exist in the ecosystem but it’s not going to be a global currency … It’s not going to replace the dollar.However, he also does not believe that bitcoin can be “regulated out of existence.”El-Erian additionally revealed that he bought some bitcoin during the “crypto winter” of 2018 when the price of BTC plunged to almost $3,000 but did not specify how much he bought. “I felt compelled to buy it — I really did … I felt like I had framed it. I had this level, I had an entry point,” he shared.The economic advisor held on to his BTC position until late 2020 when bitcoin regained the $19,000 level. However, he admitted that he misjudged when to sell due to “behavioral mistakes.”He categorized bitcoin investors into three types. The first is “fundamentalists,” who are investing for the long haul. The second is professional investors, who are looking to diversify their portfolios, and the last is day trading “speculators.”He explained that the first two types of investors are “really strong foundations for that market long-term.” However, he noted that he would only feel comfortable buying bitcoin again once some of the speculators in the market are “shaken out.”He urges the crypto industry to engage with regulators sooner rather than later as crypto is becoming more mainstream. He said this will help avoid the regulatory headwinds facing internet giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. “When I speak to people in the crypto industry, I say you have a responsibility not to repeat the mistake of Big Tech. The big mistake of Big Tech was they didn’t realize they were becoming systemically important, so they didn’t engage in preemptive regulatory discussions,” he detailed.Furthermore, the Allianz economic advisor warned:Crypto needs to take seriously that there are concerns about illicit payments. There’s concerns about fraud. There’s concerns about stability of platform.In August, El-Erian said, “The time has come for more western governments to stop dismissing the crypto revolution as some mix of illicit payments schemes and reckless financial speculation.” He added: “I tend to tell people: be really careful. This is an asset that wants to establish itself, but it can only establish itself if governments allow it to.”Do you agree with the Allianz economist about bitcoin?

325,$9 Billion in Bitcoin: Court Trustee Says Mt Gox Rehabilitation Plan 'Final and Binding',"Nov 17, 2021","Mt Gox claimants may see restitution soon as a recent filing from the Tokyo District Court’s trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi explains that the rehabilitation plan is now “final and binding.” The document published on Tuesday notes that an announcement will follow that discloses the “details of the specific timing, procedures, and amount of such repayments.”On Tuesday, Nobuaki Kobayashi published a notice of confirmation that the rehabilitation plan has been finalized. $Over 9 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) may find its way back to the original owners who lost money during the Mt Gox hack and bankruptcy that followed. Since 2014, thousands of former Mt Gox users have tried to get their funds back and have been met with a myriad of obstacles over the years.Kobayashi’s filing says that the Tokyo court revealed the draft rehabilitation plan in May and on October 20, 2021, it was “approved by a large majority of rehabilitation creditors.” The court filing does not disclose when the funds will be disbursed and if the funds will be paid directly in bitcoin (BTC). “An announcement will be made to rehabilitation creditors on the details of the specific timing, procedures, and amount of such repayments,” Kobayashi said.Mt Gox was one of the largest bitcoin exchanges before it went under in 2014, which saw close to 24,000 customers affected. The exchange was operated by Mark Karpelès and originally the exchange lost 850,000 BTC but Karpelès managed to locate some of the bitcoin from cold storage. Reports detail that there’s roughly 150,000 BTC that Kobayashi reportedly will distribute to Mt Gox creditors.The court filing published on Tuesday further explains that the trustee expects “all the rehabilitation creditors” to register information such as bank account info using the online filing system. The website details that the period for filing proofs tied to claims ended on October 22, and since then users can no longer file proofs of rehabilitation claims via the online filing system.Kobayashi adds that the trustee and court will not respond to direct inquiries or emailed inquiries concerning the claim process. Moreover, those who leverage the online filing system may still have to wait a bit longer as Kobayashi explained that a large number of inquiries may delay reply times.What do you think about the latest Mt Gox reimbursement filing?

327,"Investment Manager Expects Governments to Clamp Down on Bitcoin, Warns of 'Intense' Crypto Regulation","Nov 16, 2021","The founder and chief investment officer of Hayman Capital Management, Kyle Bass, has warned that governments will start to really clamp down on bitcoin. He predicts that “intense” crypto regulation will come out of the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) next year.Kyle Bass, founder and chief investment officer of Hayman Capital Management, talked about bitcoin and the outlook for cryptocurrencies in an interview on the Investor’s Podcast Network, published Saturday. Bass is a hedge fund manager who made winning bets on subprime loans in 2007.While acknowledging that “Millennials love private crypto” and “people like to think it’s a perfect substitute or a great substitute for gold and/or an inflation protector,” Bass said:I tend to think that you’re going to see authoritarian governments and Western democracies alike start to really clamp down on bitcoin.He referenced China which has been cracking down on crypto activities. “I know China first kicked the miners out and then banned private crypto. They did that a year earlier than I expected them to do it,” he opined, adding:I think next year, you’re going to see intense regulation come from the US Treasury and the IRS.He also discussed “discount rates” and how to protect against “this insidious inflation.”“I know bitcoin has done well. I know that the returns have literally been off the charts for many, and there are many newly minted billionaires out there in bitcoin land,” he noted. However, he warned: “I think the easy money has been made … I think from here on out, it’s going to be really difficult to make money there.”Bass further shared: “I own a couple of private positions in big firms that are trading, lending against, and developing bitcoins and NFTs [non-fungible tokens] and all of the digital universe of alphabet soup things that are out there.” He concluded: “I think that the blockchain, I think that NFTs, those things are all very much here to stay. Private crypto, I put a question mark by over the long run. I’d be careful with that now.”The investment manager also does not think we are in a bubble. “I don’t believe we’re in a bubble today, as far as ratios are concerned and leverage in the system is a concern,” he said.What do you think about Kyle Bass’ comments?

328,Bitcoin Hashrate Nears All-Time High Captured in May — BTC Mining Rigs Produced in 2016 Still Profitable,"Nov 15, 2021","While bitcoin’s value has remained well above the $60K range, the network’s hashrate has surged to over 184 exahash per second (EH/s) as mining devices are far more profitable at these prices. The price has made it so that older generation mining devices manufactured over four years ago, with processing power of more than 8 terahash per second (TH/s), can make a daily profit mining the leading crypto asset.On November 15, 2021, Bitcoin’s hashrate climbed to 184 EH/s gathering 17.19% more hashpower than the network saw a mere two days ago on November 13. Bitcoin’s (BTC) hashrate is getting close to nearing its all-time high (ATH), which was recorded on May 9, 2021, at 191 EH/s. Today’s Bitcoin hashrate metrics show that the hashpower is only 3.8% away from surpassing its ATH, according to coinwarz.com data.In addition to BTC’s hashrate nearing ATH, the second-largest crypto asset in terms of market valuation, ethereum’s (ETH) higher prices have also propelled its network hashrate. At 932 TH/s, Ethereum’s hashrate is awfully close to a single petahash per second or 0.001 EH/s. Ethereum’s hashrate has already reached an ATH and has continued to soar higher, capturing new records.It’s worth it for miners to mine ether in comparison to BTC, as ETH is the third most profitable network to mine. At press time, the most profitable ether mining rig the Innosilicon A11 Pro that produces 1,500 megahash per second (MH/s) or 0.0015 TH/s can rake in $109.29 per day. The profit estimate stems from asicminervalue.com using today’s ether exchange rates and $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in electric consumption.The profits for the ether mining rigs are larger than BTC’s mining profits stemming from the most profitable application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining devices. Three SHA256 compatible miners on the market today, however, can command $36 per day in profits using $0.12 per kWh in electric consumption and today’s BTC prices.The Microbt Whatsminer M30S++, the Ipollo B2, and the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro are today’s most profitable BTC miners on the market, according to stats from asicminervalue.com. All three models boast hash speeds at over 100 TH/s. The Canaan Avalonminer 1246 which boasts 90 TH/s produces an estimated $27.55 per day using today’s exchange rates. Furthermore, besides the top mining devices pulling in the highest profits, old school miners from 2016 are now profiting.For instance, using $0.12 per kWh in electricity per day and today’s BTC prices, a Bitmain Antminer R4 (8.7 TH/s) can get at least $1.18 per day. The R4 mining rig was produced in 2017 and the popular Bitmain Antminer S9 (11.5 TH/s), manufactured over four years ago can get up to $1.53 per day with electrical rates at $0.12 per kWh.What do you think about the recent mining action and Bitcoin’s hashrate climbing to 184 exahash per second?

329,Marathon Plans to Raise $500 Million From Convertible Senior Notes to Buy Bitcoin and Mining Rigs,"Nov 15, 2021","On Monday, the enterprise bitcoin mining operation Marathon Digital Holdings announced the firm will raise $500 million from convertible senior notes in order to accrue more “bitcoin or bitcoin mining machines.”Marathon (Nasdaq: MARA), is one of the largest U.S. mining operations and on November 15, the firm revealed it plans to utilize debt markets for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin or bitcoin mining machines.” The news comes after significant growth during the course of 2021 and at the end of October, Marathon disclosed it had mined 417 bitcoin (BTC). With over $457 million worth of bitcoin held in its coffers, the 417 BTC revenue was considerably larger than the month prior.“As in prior months, our bitcoin production was impacted by maintenance-related outages at the power plant in Hardin, MT and increases in the total network hash rate,” Marathon’s CEO Fred Thiel explained. “However, with shipments of our previously purchased miners accelerating over the coming months, we continue to expect our bitcoin production to become more consistent as we scale,” the Marathon executive added.In a press release sent to Bitcoin.com News, the company said on Monday that it plans to issue “$500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes” that will mature on December 1, 2026. The notes will obtain interest semi-annually unless they are “repurchased, redeemed or converted,” Marathon’s press release notes.“Marathon intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin or bitcoin mining machines,” the company disclosed.The U.S. company’s shares listed on Nasdaq have done well in recent times and Marathon has been holding BTC on its balance sheet like its mining competitors Argo, Hut8, Riot Blockchain, and Bitfarms. Six months ago, MARA shares were trading hands for $22.99 on May 18, and today shares swap for $75.92.Bitcoin.com News reported on Marathon buying BTC for a reserve asset at the end of January following the company’s record-breaking acquisition of 70,000 ASIC bitcoin miners in December 2020. Marathon came under controversy this year when the enterprise mining operation mined its first OFAC-compliant block. It meant that at the time, Marathon was filtering transactions to be compliant with the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) sanction guidelines.However, the company dropped this filtering procedure after it was well established that the Taproot upgrade would happen. Marathon said the company’s mining pool would “no longer filter transactions” and “begin validating transactions in a manner consistent with all other miners who use the standard node.”Two months later, the firm revealed it purchased 30,000 S19j Pro Antminers from Bitmain and after it published July’s bitcoin production and mining operation it was revealed that Fidelity Investments owns a 7.4% stake in Marathon.The latest financing proposal to leverage convertible senior notes indicates the firm continues to believe in the bitcoin mining industry’s exponential growth. At press time, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been once again nearing all-time highs and the current hashrate on November 15, is a whopping 181 exahash per second (EH/s).What do you think about Marathon using debt markets to raise $500 million in order to acquire bitcoin and bitcoin mining rigs?

330,Skybridge Capital Founder Says Bitcoin 'Will Easily Trade at $500K' — Urges Investors to Buy Right Now,"Nov 14, 2021","Skybridge Capital’s founder says bitcoin “will easily trade at $500,000 a coin,” noting that investors should buy some right now, even at the current price. “I’m trying to do my best to explain to them why they need to own this right now,” he said, emphasizing that we are still “very, very early.”Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and managing partner of New York City-based investment firm Skybridge Capital, commented on the U.S. economy, inflation, and bitcoin on CNBC Friday. Scaramucci briefly served as the White House director of communications during the Trump administration in July 2017.He was asked whether he advises people to buy bitcoin at the current price of around $64,000. Scaramucci promptly replied, “no question about that.”At the current BTC price level, he said, “I still believe we are very, very early.” He noted that if Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is correct and there are “a billion wallets at the end of 2024 into the middle of 2025,” he expects:These coins will easily trade at $500,000 a coin. Remember, you don’t even have enough bitcoin for every millionaire in our society to earn one coin.In September, Wood doubled down on her $500K bitcoin price prediction. “If we are right and companies continue to diversify their cash into something like bitcoin, institutional investors start allocating 5% of their funds into … bitcoin, or other crypto,” she said, “We believe that the price will be tenfold of where it is today … over $500,000.”“JPMorgan said there are 49 million millionaires based on U.S. dollar fiat currency,” Scaramucci added. “You don’t even have enough [for each millionaire]. So, for me, I think this is a very scarce property.”He further explained that given rising inflation fears: “I’m telling people to own a little bit of bitcoin because that’s offering you an adaptive technology that’s evolving. And the second thing that it’s offering you is a potential inflation hedge.” He continued:This is very, very early for people. And I’m trying to do my best to explain to them why they need to own this right now.What do you think about Scaramucci’s advice? Let us know in the comments section below.

331,Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary Advises How to Get Into Bitcoin — Crypto Now 10% of His Portfolio,"Nov 14, 2021","Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, has some advice on how to get into bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. “It’s a wonderful universe. It’s a fantastic asset. It’s a must-own if you’re an investor,” O’Leary said. He also revealed that his crypto exposure has grown to about 10%.Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Shares ETFs, gave some advice for new investors wanting to get into bitcoin or the crypto space for the first time during an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, published early this month.O’Leary was asked, “Do you have any advice for people curious about bitcoin or just getting into the space?” He replied:I really advise them to explore this asset and the way to do it is to start small, start to understand the platforms. Are you going to buy it through a centralized wallet? Are you going to decentralize? Try all the options, learn by experience.He added: “The thing about bitcoin is you need to learn how to work with it … There’s many different ways to approach it. There’s many different ways to own it.”The Shark Tank star then shared that “his 25-year-old son is completely adept now at all of the ways to own bitcoin — all the ways to trade it, all the ways to own it, all the ways to stake it. He is the next generation. He did it on his own. He’s never been in a bank branch. He never goes into a bank, doesn’t know why he would.”O’Leary continued: “Gen Z and millennials, and now baby boomers, are all learning. They make mistakes. I know people have lost their coins, but they did it on a small basis. And they don’t make that mistake again. They create awareness of how to do it.”He emphasized:It’s a wonderful universe. It’s a fantastic asset. It’s a must-own if you’re an investor, and then it’s about how you do it. But it’s all about education.O’Leary noted that the good news is there is a “community that provides a tremendous resource online. You can spend just three or four hours and you will become … quite knowledgeable on what Bitcoin is, how it works, and how to own it.”During a Reddit Talk session on Thursday, he explained that his crypto holdings include a number of cryptocurrencies as well as companies and products in the space, such as firms building decentralized wallets. “So, we’re going to end up at the end of the year with a very significant holding in crypto assets, and it’s not just bitcoin,” he shared.While the Shark Tank star did not disclose all his crypto holdings, he confirmed that he owns bitcoin, ether, and USD coin, among others. He admitted that he owns “a lot of ethereum.” He bought his first coin in 2017.Mr. Wonderful revealed:I’ve grown the portfolio remarkably. At the beginning of the year, I was at 3% weighting. The target was to get 7% by year-end. However, because of the appreciation of so many of the assets I have now, we’re almost at 10% today.In early October, he said that his crypto exposure was more than gold for the first time. In September, he said he expects a “trillion dollars” to flow into BTC.Last month, Bitcoin.com News reported on his Shark Tank co-star Mark Cuban, the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, when he gave some advice to new crypto investors.What do you think about Kevin O’Leary’s advice on how to get into bitcoin and crypto?

332,Highly Anticipated Bitcoin Upgrade Taproot Activates — Taproot Script-Spends Seen in the Wild,"Nov 14, 2021","Bitcoin advocates are celebrating the successful implementation of the Taproot upgrade after block height 709,632. The upgrade was highly anticipated as it was one of the biggest changes since the introduction of Segregated Witness (Segwit) in 2017. After the upgrade was completed, the Bitcoin community discussed the slew of benefits Taproot and Schnorr signatures have to offer and have started measuring Taproot usage as well.At 12:15 a.m. (EST) at block height 709,632, at difficulty period 352, Taproot was officially activated on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. The upgrade was long-awaited as it’s an improvement that’s taken seven years to complete.Taproot allows users to operate Bitcoin scripts in a myriad of ways in order to improve privacy, scalability, and security. Combining Taproot with an improvement called Schnorr signatures allows for more compact transactions and key aggregation, which provides a multi-faceted array of multi-signature transaction schemes. Schnorr offers three major benefits according to the codebase introduction on Github:The collaboration technique or key aggregation “is the building block for various higher-level constructions that improve efficiency and privacy, such as multi-signatures and others,” the Github description adds.The Schnorr signature scheme is combined with MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Tree), which essentially creates a new script language called Tapscript. The Taproot activation page on Github now says: “Taproot locked-in. Thanks miners.” After Taproot was activated a great number of crypto supporters discussed the implementation on social media.“The Taproot upgrade for Bitcoin has officially [been] activated,” bitcoin investor Anthony Pompliano tweeted after the upgrade. “Congratulations and thank you to every developer, miner, and Bitcoiner who made this happen.” Another individual dubbed ‘Hashoveride’ tweeted:Taproot activated! Bitcoin upgraded! This is how consensus is formed and upgrades are done! Incredibly slow, non-controversial, and not forced. Y’all better recognise. [Bitcoin] ready to fly.Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille also discussed the successful soft fork on Twitter and thanked all the network participants.“At long last, BIP341/342 (“taproot”) are active on Bitcoin mainnet. Thanks to everyone involved for getting us this far,” Wuille tweeted. “The real work will be in building wallets/protocols that build on top of it to make use of its advantages. I’m very excited to see where that takes us,” the Bitcoin developer added. Other bitcoin fans shared data of Taproot being used in the wild. For instance, Alekos Filini wrote:A modified version @bitcoindevkit made this transaction. It’s a Taproot script-spend with a 1-of-2 multisig that uses the new `OP_CHECKSIGADD.` It looks like this is the first ever `OP_CHECKSIGADD` used on Bitcoin! It’s the third Taproot script-spend in the block, but the two coming in before didn’t use that opcode.Additionally, the blockchain analysis Open Exploration Tool (oxt.me) tweeted about Taproot usage on the Bitcoin blockchain after the successful implementation. “It’s happening #Taproot,” the oxt.me Twitter account said, sharing a Taproot usage chart. Bitcoiner Lyle Pratt also talked about the benefits of Taproot and explained why he was excited.“[Three] reasons I’m personally excited about Taproot,” Pratt wrote. “1) the upgrade process gave us a good recipe for future upgrades. 2) taproot will help proliferate new DLCs services and use cases, eventually bringing them to Lightning. 3) 1 mil+ participant multisig federations are now possible.”When asked by another individual what the benefits of federated multi-sig for many participants would be, Pratt responded by noting: “Much more decentralized pools of signers or oracles are now possible. Pre-taproot about ~15 p2sh signers was the practical limit.”What do you think about the successful implementation of the Bitcoin upgrade Taproot and the community’s opinion about the latest soft fork?

333,Crypto Advocates Weigh ETF Rejection — Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Says Bitcoiners Should 'Oppose Spot Bitcoin ETFs in US’,"Nov 14, 2021","Following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of Vaneck’s bitcoin spot market exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Friday, a number of cryptocurrency advocates discussed the subject this weekend. For instance, the veteran FX trader Peter Brandt told his 581,700 Twitter followers that bitcoin maximalists “should oppose” a spot market bitcoin ETF. Bitcoiner Preston Pysh said bitcoin could care less “about the approval of a spot ETF.”During the first week of November, U.S. lawmakers urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But on November 12, the U.S. regulator rejected Vaneck’s bitcoin spot ETF and cited a lack of prevention toward “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” in the market. The rejection also follows the approval of the first bitcoin ETFs based on the crypto asset’s derivatives markets, specifically futures.In fact, the Proshares Strategy ETF debut captured close to $1 billion in volume and broke records for previously listed exchange-traded funds. Then SEC chairman Gary Gensler told the public why the SEC approved a bitcoin futures version of an ETF. After the Vaneck bitcoin spot market ETF rejection, a number of digital currency proponents discussed the situation. The veteran FX and cryptocurrency trader, Peter Brandt, tweeted on Saturday that bitcoin advocates should disapprove of a bitcoin spot market ETF.“IMO, Bitcoin maximalists should oppose spot [bitcoin] ETFs in [the] U.S.,” Brandt said. Bitcoin’s store of value story depends on its scarcity and even some difficulty to purchase. Let’s not encourage greedy grub-hungry Wall Street to convert BTC into a vending machine asset. Say NO to ETFs,” the analyst added.Host of The Investor’s Podcast (Bitcoin Fundamentals), Preston Pysh, also discussed the SEC refusal on social media. “The SEC is making decisions on the bitcoin spot ETF which benefits hedge funds [and] Wall Street at the expense of retail investors,” Pysh said. “Gary Gensler, Hester Peirce isn’t this the opposite of what you’re charted to do? We want answers. Your decisions are increasing distrust,” the podcast host noted. Pysh also said bitcoin could care less about the SEC decision and stated:Here’s the beauty folks. Bitcoin gives 2 sh*ts about the approval of a spot ETF. It costs nearly nothing to custody and it settles in 10 min. They are fighting a clock – tick, tock, tick…This thing literally feasts on corruption and manipulation and boy is the plate full.Some individuals argued that bitcoin futures are easier to manipulate and that’s why the U.S. government has allowed the derivatives version. “The SEC denied a spot [bitcoin] ETF. Why? Because futures are easier to manipulate IMO,” the Twitter handle dubbed ‘Meme Sergeant Spliff’ wrote. “The head of the CFTC admitted they can ‘tamp down’ silver prices via futures. What do metals [and] bitcoin have in common? Anti inflationary. They can tamp them down, so USD looks more attractive/safer,” he added.Meanwhile, most crypto traders were pleased to see that the rejection “had no real bad price influence.” Many others shared the opinion that bitcoin “doesn’t need a spot ETF.” “As long as the Real Bitcoiners keep buying and hodling,” Rodolfo Martinez wrote. “This rocket is heading to the moon and beyond.”What do you think about the recent opinions this weekend about the SEC rejecting Vaneck’s bitcoin spot market ETF? What do you think about Peter Brandt’s statements about opposing a spot ETF in the U.S.? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

334,Santander Prepares to Offer Bitcoin ETF in Spain,"Nov 14, 2021","Santander, a leading financial institution in Spain, is preparing to offer a Bitcoin ETF to its customers in the country. This, while Spanish asset managers have been largely reluctant to embrace crypto products as part of their investment portfolio offerings to customers.Santander will be giving the finishing touches to a Bitcoin ETF product in Spain, according to reports from local sources. This reportedly positions the company to be the only financial institution interested in offering this type of product to its customers in Spain. Santander’s Executive Chairman Ana Botín declared that the institution has had a team working on this offering for some time. She stated:Our clients want to buy bitcoin, but we have been quite slow to adopt it due to regulatory issues. We are now about to offer crypto ETFs.The fact is that most asset managers in Spain are still reluctant to put their funds in cryptocurrency-based investments, at least domestically. Spain’s BBVA is already offering bitcoin trading services to its users in Switzerland, due to the advanced cryptocurrency ecosystem and clear regulations the country offers. But crypto regulation in Spain is a whole different issue.Botín could have been referring to the work they are doing on the ETF within the bank, because no product of this kind has been registered with the CNMV, the institution that oversees the securities market in the country. Botín also failed to offer any kind of timeline regarding the availability of this product.The first cryptocurrency ETF approved in the U.S. stirred up demand from institutions that were waiting for a more traditional and regulated product to invest in cryptocurrencies. However, the vehicle approved was a bitcoin futures ETF, making its management costly and taking part of its charm away for small investors. Local investors in Spain agree that if a similar product gets approved, it should be a spot bitcoin ETF to minimize management costs.Even so, some feel the importance and reach of such an important product for investing in bitcoin should not be overlooked, as it could give Santander an advantage when it comes to portfolio offerings. Other banks have failed to see the importance of such an offering, with CaixaBank, Sabadell, and Bankinter declaring they are still waiting for more regulation in the field.What do you think about Santander’s Bitcoin ETF bid in Spain?

335,"Egyptian Billionaire Remains Bullish on Gold, Says It's Wrong to Compare Precious Metal to Bitcoin","Nov 13, 2021","Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris has said he remains bullish on gold and has no intention to invest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin because such investment is a very risky business.In his remarks published by The National News, the billionaire reveals he believes it is wrong for people to make comparisons between gold and bitcoin. Sawiris, who is also the executive chairman of Cairo-based Orascom Investment Holding, insists gold is still the safe-haven asset.“I’m still very bullish [on gold] and it is a safe haven. People now are comparing Bitcoin with gold; it’s a wrong comparison,” said the billionaire.As a sign of his endorsement of gold ahead of cryptocurrency, one of the companies that Sawiris backs, AKH Gold, is reported to have signed a deal to explore nine blocks in Egypt’s gold-rich Eastern Desert. Similarly, La Mancha Holding — the company which the billionaire chairs — is reported to have launched a $1.4 billion investment fund this year to pursue investments in gold mining.However, with respect to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Sawiris, who has a net worth of $3.2 billion, insists the volatility of such assets makes them very risky investments. Consequently, Sawiris warned people investing in cryptocurrencies they should expect to lose. He said:When the doomsday comes and it crashes, the last people in the row will lose.Interestingly, the billionaire is also quoted warning of an asset valuation bubble that is forming in the wake of quick economic rebound and abundant liquidity after government measures slowed down the global economy. According to Sawiris, some stocks or shares are overpriced and there will be a correction sooner or later.He then advises investors to be selective of how they balance their overall portfolios and the stocks they pick in equity markets. He added that investors should “always keep a position in cash because you don’t [know] what happens [next].”Do you agree with Sawiris’ remarks about cryptocurrencies?

336,Bitcoin’s Hashrate Soars 42% Higher Over the Last 3 Months Following Crypto Asset’s 36% Price Increase,"Nov 13, 2021","While bitcoin has been hovering above the $60K handle for a great majority of the last 28 days, the network’s hashrate has jumped considerably during that time as well. Since August 13, Bitcoin’s hashrate has climbed 42% from 110 exahash per second (EH/s) to today’s 157 EH/s. Moreover, after nine consecutive difficulty changes, going forward, it will be 50% more difficult to mine bitcoin than it was three months ago for the next two weeks.At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s hashrate is coasting along at 157 EH/s and approximately 14 known mining pools are dedicating hashpower to the network. 16.39 exahash or 10.24% of the network is being mined by stealth miners and the hashrate is classified as “unknown.”The unknown hashrate represents the fifth-largest mining ‘pool’ dedicating hash toward the network. Meanwhile, during the last three months, Bitcoin’s hashrate has followed the price moving northbound. The overall hashrate is 42% higher than it was three months ago and that was roughly a month after China’s crackdown on bitcoin miners.In the last three months, hashrate averages show that at some points during the last three months, Bitcoin’s hashrate ran as high as 180 EH/s. Bitcoin’s hashrate has climbed above the 180 EH/s region three times since October 25.Bitcoin’s price has hovered above the $60K price range since October 15 and dipped under $60K on one occasion during that time. Because the hashrate has been gradually rising, Bitcoin’s network difficulty as of this weekend, will have adjusted upward nine times in a row. The nine adjustments equates to being over 50% more difficult to mine bitcoin (BTC) since July 17, 2021.Today, the top four mining pools command 58.6% of the network’s hashrate during the last three days. F2pool is the largest mining pool with 28.51% EH/s and Antpool commands 26%. Foundry USA captures 12.69% of the global hashrate as the third-largest mining pool today. Foundry’s pool commands roughly 20.32 EH/s at the time of writing.Viabtc is the fifth largest mining pool with 11.8% of the global hashrate translating to 18.89 EH/s. The fifth-largest hashrate today belongs to stealth miners known as “unknown” with 16.39 EH/s. Below this portion of the hashrate pie is another ten mining pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain.The most profitable miners on the market are making decent profits between $34 to close to $45 per day with today’s exchange rates, the current mining difficulty, and $0.07 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in electricity costs. The Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ (112 TH/s) will bring in 44.77 per day at current BTC exchange rates and the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro (110 TH/s) pulls in $44.24 per day.Canaan’s top model, the Avalonminer 1246 (90 TH/s) can get around $34.92 every 24 hours using current exchange rates. If the new Bitmain Antminer S19 XP was in the wild today, it could pull in around $58.20 a day with its 140 TH/s hashpower. However, the unit is not expected to be sold until July 2022.What do you think about the recent mining action and Bitcoin’s hashrate climbing 42% higher in three months?

337,"Moonshot to $90K — After Bitcoin Upgrade Taproot Activates, Crypto Advocates Expect the Price to Rally","Nov 12, 2021","In mid-June, the ‘Speedy Trial’ lock-in period for the Bitcoin network upgrade Taproot locked in at block height 687,285 and was mined by the bitcoin mining pool Slushpool. Taproot is expected to activate on the network on Sunday, November 14, 2021, and the upgrade is considered one of the largest changes the protocol has seen since Segregated Witness (Segwit) went live in 2017.Taproot is expected to activate and go live on the main network on Sunday, November 14, 2021, following the lock-in period this past summer. When activated, Taproot is expected to enhance the digital currency network’s scripting capacity and the ability to leverage Schnorr signatures (BIP340) will be made available. Taproot is also expected to amplify bitcoin transactions by allowing certain types of complex, ‘smart’ transactions.Schnorr signatures can help transactions scale as they are more compact than ECDSA. Schnorr can also allow key aggregation, which provides a slew of multi-signature transaction schemes. While Taproot (BIP341) creates new rules for a new Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) output type, the upgrade is a soft fork and is entirely opt-in like its predecessor Segwit.“Taproot is a proposed Bitcoin protocol upgrade that can be deployed as a forward-compatible soft fork,” the Github “Taproot-Activation” documentation notes. “By combining the Schnorr signature scheme with MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Tree) and a new scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot will expand Bitcoin’s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy by letting users mask complex smart contracts as a regular bitcoin transaction.”Discussions concerning the Taproot upgrade are all over cryptocurrency forums and social media platforms during the last few days. The much-anticipated Taproot upgrade will officially go live at block height 709,632. The activation of this specific upgrade has caused people to speculate that BTC’s price may spike significantly higher after a successful soft fork.On November 12, a bitcoin market update blog post published by decentrader.com says that market sentiment could spark a rally after the Taproot upgrade. Despite bitcoin’s (BTC) current volatility after the crypto asset tapped $69K, Decentrader explained the analysts are still “bullish” about BTC’s price rising higher. The market update states:We remain bullish on high time frames and continue to expect price to rally up to the $85,000 – $90,000 region in the coming weeks, which aligns with the 1.618 fib retracement level.Overall, people believe that once the network gets improved scalability and fungibility, the upgrade could bring a new all-time high (ATH). The Bitpanda Pro Twitter account discussed Taproot today and noted that the upgrade comes at a very opportune time. “The Taproot upgrade comes at a very bullish time,” Bitpanda tweeted on Friday. “Both for the total crypto market, which recently surpassed a value of €2.6T for the first time, and for Bitcoin itself, which has hit new ATHs multiple times over the past few weeks.”However, Bitpanda also admitted that the upgrade’s value could already be priced in, and the recent ATH to $69K could have been the spike. “However, it appears that the bulls may still have some power left to push the price higher once the upgrade comes into effect,” Bitpanda added. “Taproot, after all, is here to make Bitcoin better, more efficient, and more private, all of which are factors that could justify a higher price,” the digital asset exchange concluded.What do you think about the upcoming Taproot upgrade?

339,Meet the Antminer S19 XP — Bitmain Reveals ASIC Manufacturer's Most Powerful Bitcoin Miner,"Nov 12, 2021","At the World Digital Mining Summit in Dubai, the leading application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rig manufacturer, Bitmain, revealed the company’s most powerful bitcoin mining device to date. The new Antminer S19 XP will boast up to 140 terahash per second (TH/s) and uses 27% less electricity per terahash than the most efficient and profitable bitcoin miner today.This week the bitcoin mining industry has been buzzing about a new ASIC SHA256 mining rig manufactured by the company Bitmain. News about the new miner was first leaked by the Chinese journalist and former Bitmain employee Colin Wu. The journalist wrote that compared to the current generation of Antminer S19s, the latest in the series of models has “been greatly improved.” Following Wu’s tweet on November 6, Bitmain hosted the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Dubai and revealed the firm’s next-generation machine.Bitmain’s new miner will pack a lot of computing power as 140 TH/s will be the most powerful mining rig released on the market to date. The new rig’s specifications show the miner’s efficiency is 21.5 joules per terahash (J/TH), which is considerably more efficient than the S19 Pro’s 29.5 J/TH. The S19 XP not only will use 27% less electricity per terahash, it also claims to provide 37% more hashpower per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The S19 XP leverages the SHA256 mining algorithm and has a power consumption of 3,010 watts off the wall.According to the announcement, the machines will be available to the general public in July 2022. However, it seems that five bitcoin mining operations have been selected to be Bitmain’s first S19 XP customers. Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq:GREE) was one of the companies selected and Ault Global Holdings’ (NYSE American:DPW) subsidiary Bitnile was also chosen to partner with Bitmain. Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the company’s executive chairman, tweeted some photos of himself signing a contract on stage in Dubai.Bitnile disclosed the new shipment of Antminer S19 XPs will be leveraged at the firm’s Michigan data center and “result in a significant increase in Bitnile’s Bitcoin mining capabilities and future revenues.” The announcement stemming from Greenidge details that the company aims to deploy its units “at a facility to be developed in South Carolina or Texas.” Greenidge also explained that the delivery of S19 XPs will occur in the “third quarter of 2022.”Bitmain’s Antminer S19 XP will also boast 5-nanometer (5-nm) chip technology and the semiconductors come from Taiwan. In the Greenidge S19 XP acquisition announcement, Bitmain’s business development director of the NCSA region, Irene Gao, discussed the new S19s. “Like Greenidge and many of our customers, Bitmain is dedicated to improving the carbon footprint of the bitcoin mining industry. That is why we’re thrilled to announce not only the S19 XP but also the green Antminer S19 XP.” Gao concluded:Bitmain is manufacturing a limited edition green Antminer S19 XP and is offsetting 100% of the carbon footprint associated with the production and the first year’s operation of these miners by purchasing carbon offset credits.What do you think about the latest Bitmain miner announcement?

342,"1,000 Bitcoin From 2010 Worth $68M — Mystery Whale Returns Moving a String of 20 Decade-Old BTC Block Rewards","Nov 10, 2021","154 days ago, a mystery bitcoin mining entity spent a string of 20 block rewards from 2010 that sat idle for well over a decade. Our newsdesk has been investigating this bitcoin whale’s actions since catching the entity in 2020. Now after the June 9th appearance, on November 10, the mystery whale returned once again to spend another 1,000 bitcoin stemming from 20 block rewards mined more than ten years ago.Last year, following the market carnage on March 12, 2020, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday,’ Bitcoin.com News discovered a large whale spending 20 consecutive block rewards in a row stemming from blocks mined way back in 2010. From here, similar to Herman Melville’s Captain Ahab, our investigation led our newsdesk to discover a myriad of whale sightings, as large quantities of 2010 bitcoin (BTC) block reward strings were spent in 2020 and 2021 as well.According to our timeline, the entity spent 20 decade-old bitcoin block rewards on March 12, 2020, October 11, 2020, November 7, 2020, November 8, 2020, December 27, 2020, January 3, 2021 (Bitcoin’s 12th anniversary), January 10, 2021, January 25, 2021, February 28, 2021, March 23, 2021, and June 9, 2021. Now, five months later, on November 10, 2021, the mystery whale has once again transferred 20 decade-old bitcoin block rewards, spending 1,000 BTC at block height 709,029.The 1,000 bitcoins from 2010 transferred on November 10 were discovered by a Bitcoin blockchain parsing tool Bitcoin.com News leverages called Btcparser.com. The 20-block-reward spend took place on early Wednesday morning at a touch after 1:30 a.m. (ET). The transfer of the 1,000 so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ also followed the exact same patterns as the whale’s previous spends indicating that it is likely the same bitcoin mining entity.These particular block rewards were mined in 2010 during the months of August, September, and October. Another similarity is the fact that this miner has spent the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) tied to the original 2010 bitcoin (BTC) addresses. The 1,000 BCH was transferred at Bitcoin Cash block height 713,430. The BCH was spent roughly an hour after the BTC was transferred and the bitcoinsv (BSV) tied to the coins remain idle. The mystery 2010 mining whale has followed this routine during every single 20-block-reward string spend.Furthermore, the whale then consolidated the 1,000 BTC into one address (just like all the times before) and the coins are then distributed into wallets with 10 BTC each. The whale also consolidated the 1,000 BCH and then the coins were split into batches of 50 BCH per wallet. Speaking with Bitcoin.com News, the creator of Btcparser.com believes the coins might be going to an escrow account. “That P2SH address looks like an escrow account,” he said. “When bitcoins are received, the previous owner gets paid and later the new owner begins his distribution among many 10 BTC wallets,” the onchain researcher added.The distribution also looks like the coins could have been transferred to an exchange. On January 27, 2021, Bitcoin.com News and other onchain researchers assumed it was possible that Coinbase was the final receiver of these ‘forgotten bitcoins’ from 2010. Essentially, the batches of 10 BTC could be held by an exchange and referred to as “pockets for withdrawal.”The coins could possibly be held for the crypto exchange’s VIP user base as the coins are considered ‘virgin bitcoins.’ There’s been a longstanding rumor that ‘virgin bitcoins’ can fetch a premium of more than 20% above the spot price. ‘Virgin bitcoins’ are coins that have been mined but have never been associated with other transactions and bitcoins tethered to unfavorable actions.The cryptocurrency community has no idea who the 2010 miner is but it is quite clear the entity mined a great quantity of bitcoin in the early days. Today’s transaction of 1,000 so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins’ was worth $68.4 million at the time of transfer and the bitcoin cash (BCH) spend was worth $712,070.It’s also worth noting that the terms “spent” or “spend” in this article, do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party for fiat or another crypto asset. The string of 20 block rewards and the 1,000 bitcoins sifted into wallets with 10 BTC per wallet could very well still belong to the original owner.What do you think about the 2010 mining entity that has been spending 20 block rewards with 1,000 bitcoin in strings? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

343,"Venezuelan Court Rolls Back Seizure of More Than 1,000 Bitcoin Miners","Nov 10, 2021","A Venezuelan court in the capital of the country has rolled back a seizure of more than 1,000 Bitcoin miners due to irregularities that occurred during the confiscation. According to court documents, the equipment that was seized was in the custody of a third-party company that was doing maintenance services. The court ordered Sunacrip, the national crypto watchdog, to retrieve these miners from their owners.A Venezuelan court located in the capital of the country has decided to roll back a seizure measure that the national cryptocurrency watchdog, Sunacrip, executed last month. The operation, which was carried out in a joint effort by the scientific police of the country and Sunacrip, presented several irregularities and according to court documents, violated the “right to defense and due process, as well as the right to property of the plaintiff company.”The equipment seized was undergoing maintenance by third parties and the operation inspected these companies, taking 12 Antminer S9-S9Is, 1,624 EBANG E9Is, and 1,475 power sources into custody. However, Sunacrip didn’t specify the location where these miners were to be held.Another irregularity noticed by the court is that this kind of procedure allows for the required documents to be presented within a window of 15 days. However, in this case, authorities seized the equipment on the same day.With the introduction of this kind of demand in Venezuelan legislation, there is now a precedent stating that courts can indeed interfere in these cases if there is the presumption of a violation of the rights of property, economic freedom, or due process. The decision of the court states that this seized equipment must be given back to its owner, a company called Sierramoros, who will have custody of it until the matter is settled.Another interesting element of the case is that because the Sunacrip officer who supervised the operation didn’t specify the site where these miners would be stored, the plaintiffs believe that these miners could be being used by third parties to mine bitcoin while the matter of the case is solved.The court ordered that while Sierramoros is entitled to have custody of these miners, it can’t put them to work until the ongoing revision of its permits is closed.What do you think about the actions of this Venezuelan court? Tell us in the comments section below.

344,"As Bitcoin Soared Past $68K, Plan B Says Floor Model Shows BTC Reaching '$100K This Year'","Nov 9, 2021","On November 8, 2021, the price of bitcoin reached an all-time high of $68,564 per unit at 10:57 p.m. (ET) on Monday evening. Meanwhile, Plan B, the creator of the bitcoin price model called stock-to-flow (S2F), has correctly predicted the last three months of bitcoin prices and recently said that based on the floor model the price will reach $100K this year. Four months ago in June, Plan B tweeted that his “worst-case scenario for 2021” bitcoin (BTC) prices “on-chain based” would be “Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K.” During the first week of August, Plan B reconfirmed his confidence in the price forecast and said “$64K was not the top.”After correctly predicting the bitcoin prices for the months of August, September, and October, Plan B has been discussing BTC’s current price run-up during the first week of November. On November 3, Plan B tweeted that bitcoin’s “Relative Strength Index [is] 72” and further noted that “bitcoin [is] looking strong.”Two days later, Plan B published a poll asking his 1.4 million Twitter followers if they thought bitcoin would reach “$500K, $288K (S2FX model), $100K (S2F model), or will BTC stay below $100K… by Christmas 2021?”The poll got 242,008 votes before closing and 39.8% said it would reach $100K per unit. 31.4% of Plan B’s voters who participated in the poll believe the price could hit $288K, while 23.8% have the opinion that BTC will stay below $100K. 5% of the 242,008 votes believe there is a chance BTC will hit $500K per unit.The same day the pseudo-anonymous analyst further asked his followers “Are you ready for +$10K daily candles?” Two days later, Plan B said “bitcoin long-term momentum is rising fast.”About six hours before bitcoin (BTC) tapped an all-time high on Monday evening, Plan B once again spoke about the six-digit price prediction.“As you know S2F model predicts $100K average for this halving period (and based on floor model we reach $100K this yr),” Plan B said. “But S2FX model predicts $288K average this cycle (we need some real fireworks in 2022 for that). Let’s see where this 2nd leg of the bull market will take us,” the analyst added.What do you think about Plan B’s stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price predictions?

345,StackSwap Raises $1.3 Million in Funding Round to Build DEX on Bitcoin Network,"Nov 9, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. Prague, Czech Republic, 5 Nov 2021, StackSwap, the first complete DEX and Launchpad on the Bitcoin Network has announced the completion of its private round. According to the official press release, the blockchain platform was able to raise $1.3 million during the funding round. The investment round was led by the Stacks Foundation along with key blockchain venture capitalists including HashKey, Genesis Block Ventures (GBV) and SOSV. The early investors share the long-term vision of StackSwap to eventually become the biggest DEX on the Bitcoin Network. Stacks protocol on which Stackswap is built has attracted over $93 million in investments from renowned institutional investors like Coinbase Ventures and Winklevoss Capital. It is built on a Bitcoin-based layer-1 project that implements a smart contract function on Bitcoin and was the first token sale to be approved by the United States SEC. StackSwap released a statement following the successful private funding round. “We are happy that Stackswap will be able to engage with a wider scope of audience and institutions on our new trading platform through this investment. We have a competent global team of professional developers who have researched and have had extensive experience with the DeFi and related systems for a long time.” StackSwap a major milestone in the Bitcoin ecosystemThe successful private round is the first step in a series of developments scheduled for the coming weeks. StackSwap will be introducing the first fully functional decentralized exchange (DEX) running on the Bitcoin layer in November. The DEX will leverage Stacks mainnet which acts like a layer-2 network and enables smart contract functionalities on Bitcoin. It utilizes the core features of bitcoin and records transaction details on the Bitcoin network using its PoX consensus mechanism. StackSwap is also the first permissionless DEX that runs on the Bitcoin layer by utilizing the power of the Stacks protocol. It supports the traditional functions of DEX such as token trading through swaps and liquidity mining. In addition, StackSwap has introduced advanced features such as issuing project tokens through its dedicated Launchpad, creating trading pools and token compensation programs through PoXL mining. Users can leverage earning opportunities on the Bitcoin blockchain by staking and depositing Stacks (STX) through an unprecedented Bitcoin-based reward payment system. In addition, new projects and development teams can issue their tokens, create automated pools and execute PoXL mining without any hassles on the StackSwap launchpad platform. This helped to lower the barrier of entry for projects and made StackSwap a truly decentralized and innovative blockchain protocol.  About Stacks 2.0Stacks 2.0 is powered by PoX. PoX is a consensus algorithm involving two separate blockchains. It uses an already well-established blockchain (in this case Bitcoin) to secure a new blockchain (Stacks). PoX connects to Bitcoin with a 1:1 block ratio which means that transactions on Stacks blockchain can be verified on the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead of burning electricity on proof of work, PoX reuses already minted bitcoins as ‘’proof of computation’’ and miners represent their cost of mining in Bitcoins directly.

He says we must open our schools to teach cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, noting that bitcoin is “a new way of paying for goods and services throughout the entire globe.”New York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams talked about making NYC the center for innovation and cryptocurrency in an interview with CNN Business Sunday. He also explained the reasoning behind his tweet saying that he will take his first three paychecks in bitcoin.Adams was asked, “Would you encourage businesses in New York City to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?” He replied: “We are going to look at it. We are going to tread carefully. We are going to get it right.”He proceeded to explain: “l want to send a signal. This city was the Empire State … This is the center of innovation, self-driving cars, drone development, cybersecurity, life sciences. So when I talked about blockchain and bitcoin, young people on the street stopped and asked me: ‘What is that? What it is about?'”The mayor-elect was then asked to explain exactly what bitcoin is. Noting that “Even experts will have a challenge doing that,” Adams replied:It is a cryptocurrency. It’s a new way of paying for goods and services throughout the entire globe. And that is what we must do: open our schools to teach the technology and teach this new way of thinking when it comes down to paying for goods and services.In June, Adams promised his supporters: “In one year, one year, you’re going to see a different city … We’re going to bring businesses here. We’re going to become the center of life science, the center of cybersecurity, the center of self-driving cars, drones, the center of bitcoins. We are going to be the center of all technology.”Adams was also asked to comment on a tweet about him by Jason Furman, professor at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama Administration.Responding to Adams’ announcement that he would take his first three paychecks in BTC, Furman tweeted Thursday: “Not only is this a bad economic strategy for NYC and a bad investment decision, [but] it also seems like a conflict of interest.” He elaborated: “Like a mayor announcing ‘I’m buying a lot of Amazon stock and then going to put in places policies to benefit Amazon.'”Without mentioning that, unlike Amazon, bitcoin is not a company and there is no bitcoin CEO to benefit from the rise of BTC, Adams emphasized that he is using his personal money. The mayor-elect shared:I lost thousands of dollars in the stock market during the stock market crash in my retirement fund. Volatility is part of some of the investments that we make.“He has his analysis. I have my analysis,” Adams stressed. “And I want to make sure that this city becomes the center of innovation, no matter what that innovation is. This is what the human spirit is about — not being afraid to look at every area of innovation as we move our country and city forward.”What do you think about Eric Adams’ comments about crypto and bitcoin?

349,A New Semiconductor Manufacturing Competitor Has Entered the ASIC Bitcoin Mining Rig Industry,"Nov 8, 2021","While companies like Microbt, Bitmain, Innosilicon, Strongu, Ebang, and Canaan have ruled the roost in terms of manufacturing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin miners, a new challenger has entered the competition. A relatively unknown integrated technology firm called AGM Group Holdings has seen a lot of ASIC sales and partnerships in recent times.2021 has seen record sales, in terms of ASIC mining rigs sold by bitcoin mining rig manufacturers like Microbt, Bitmain, and Canaan. Mining operations located all around the world have purchased thousands of bitcoin mining devices from these firms during the last year.The demand for ASICs has been so high, many orders placed this year are due to be shipped at some point in 2022. Now a new challenger has entered the ASIC bitcoin mining rig manufacturing competition and recent press announcements detail AGM Group Holdings (Nasdaq:AGMH) is selling a lot of crypto mining products.On November 3, AGM announced it had “won a purchase order” from Code Chain New Continent Limited (Code Chain) and will deliver 10,000 units of its 100 terahash (TH/s) mining rigs. While AGM won the purchase order worth $65 million in ASIC machines, the mining products are expected to be shipped in the second half of 2022. According to AGM’s website, the company sells three types of bitcoin miners with various performance ratings.“[The] KOI Miner C16 Series [supports] mining of bitcoin, bitcoin cash and other cryptocurrencies. [The] KOI Miner C16 is built on a new architecture using FinFET N+1 process technology,” AGM’s website description details. “The computing power as a whole machine passes 100TH/s, as high as 113TH/s, with [the] energy consumption rate of the unit computing force reduced to as low as 30J/T.”At 113 TH/s, the KOI Miner C16 S model is estimated to pull in $39.92 per day with an electrical consumption of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It would compete with the top three mining devices the Microbt Whatsminer M30S++, the ​​Ipollo B2, and Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro. There are no reviews online yet about AGM’s KOI Miner C16 series miners and the machines are not yet listed on real-time ASIC hardware profitability rankings.In addition to the November 3 purchase announcement, a slew of other media statements have been published by AGM during the last two months. AGM announced its “first significant order” for 30,000 mining rigs on October 13, when it sold the ASIC miners to Nowlit Solutions Corp, a digital currency equipment supply chain service. On October 21, AGM sold 25,000 ASIC miners to Minerva Semiconductor Corp. Furthermore, AGM revealed a partnership with Meten Holding Group, a Nasdaq-listed English language coaching firm that is based in China.The partnership announcement caused Meten Holding Group’s stock (Nasdaq:METX) to soar in value, increasing over 44% on October 28. On that day, METX was swapping for $0.5990 per share and today, METX is changing hands for $0.62 per share. AGM’s shares on Nasdaq, AGMH, were swapping for $11.40 per share on November 5, and each share has gained 3.771%, now trading for $11.83 per unit.What do you think about the relatively unknown mining rig manufacturer stepping into the bitcoin mining industry?

350,JPMorgan Doubles Down on Bitcoin Price Prediction of $146K,"Nov 7, 2021","Global investment bank JPMorgan has doubled down on its bitcoin price prediction of $146K. The bank’s analyst explained that the price of the cryptocurrency could reach that level if its volatility subsides and institutional investors start investing in bitcoin more than gold in their portfolios.JPMorgan released an inaugural report of its new publication last week focusing on the outlook for alternative investments, including digital assets. A new report is expected to be released every two to three months.The firm’s analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has predicted that the price of bitcoin could reach $146K in the long term, with a short-term price target of $73,000 for 2022.“Digital assets are on a multi-year structural ascent, but the current entry point looks unattractive in our opinion for an investment horizon of 12 months as bitcoin appears to have returned to overbought territory,” he explained.The JPMorgan analyst added: “The re-emergence of inflation concerns among investors during September/October 2021 appears to have renewed interest in the usage of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.” Reiterating his “bullish outlook” for BTC made in October, he wrote:Bitcoin’s allure as an inflation hedge has perhaps been strengthened by the failure of gold to respond in recent weeks to heightened concerns over inflation.Panigirtzoglou expects bitcoin’s competition with gold to continue, especially as more millennials invest, given their preference for cryptocurrencies. “Considering how big the financial investment into gold is, any such crowding out of gold as an ‘alternative’ currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,” he detailed.However, the JPMorgan analyst said that for the $146,000 price prediction to come true, bitcoin’s volatility would have to fall significantly, so that rules-bound investors feel comfortable adding the cryptocurrency to their portfolios.He noted that BTC’s volatility is currently around four to five times higher than gold. The report added that the current volatility is such a problem that bitcoin’s fair price is actually around $35,000.Nonetheless, the bank noted that bitcoin’s volatility is falling and that a price of $73,000 looks reasonable as the price target for 2022. Furthermore, Panigirtzoglou said that bitcoin is wildly unpredictable and a surge above $146,000 and a plunge to below $30,000 are both possible.The JPMorgan analyst added, “There is little doubt that cryptocurrencies and digital assets more broadly are an emerging asset class and thus on a multi-year structural uptrend,” elaborating:Digital assets have emerged as a clear winner post the pandemic, with retail investors joining institutional investors such as family offices, hedge funds and real money asset managers including insurance companies in propagating the asset class.This is not the first time JPMorgan has predicted that the price of bitcoin could rise to $146K. The bank first made this bold long-term price target for bitcoin back in January, citing that bitcoin competes with gold as an alternative currency. The bank explained: “The market cap of bitcoin at $575 billion currently would have to rise by x4.6 from here, implying a theoretical bitcoin price of $146K, to match the total private sector investment in gold via ETFs or bars and coins.”JPMorgan recently explained that “the perception of bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing, triggering a shift away from gold ETFs into bitcoin funds since September.” Moreover, institutional investors are dumping gold for bitcoin seeing it as a better inflation hedge.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has remained skeptical about bitcoin. In October, he said BTC was worthless and questioned its limited supply. He also said that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and regulators will regulate the hell out of it. In May, The JPMorgan boss personally advised people to stay away from crypto. Dimon said he does not care about bitcoin but his clients are interested. Meanwhile, the firm’s clients see crypto as an asset class that they want to invest in and the bank is now offering various crypto investments to clients.What do you think about JPMorgan’s prediction?

351,Elon Musk Lets Twitter Poll Decide if He Should Sell $20 Billion in Tesla Stock — Investors Suggest Buy Bitcoin,"Nov 7, 2021","Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk has asked his Twitter followers whether he should sell his Tesla stock. He has also promised to abide by the results of the poll. Many people urge Musk to sell his Tesla shares and put money into cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin.Tesla CEO Elon Musk set up a poll on Twitter Saturday asking his 62.7 million followers to decide whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. “Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?” Musk tweeted.In a follow-up tweet, he noted that he does “not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere,” emphasizing, “I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.” The Tesla boss also promised:I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.Musk’s poll has drawn much media attention. It received more than 3.5 million votes, 57.9% of which said “Yes.” The tweet has been liked 111.5K times and retweeted 22.1K times.On Friday, Congress passed the $1.2 trillion U.S. Infrastructure bill after chopping down its hotly-debated tax plan on unrealized capital gains aimed at billionaires. That part of the bill has been spun off into a separate $1.9 trillion bill to be voted on later.The Tesla boss, now the world’s richest man with a net worth of at least $318.4 billion according to Forbes’ list of billionaires, has made several tweets criticizing the bill over the past few weeks.Many bitcoiners jumped into the poll’s thread to voice their opinions to Musk. A number of people suggested that Musk should use the proceeds from selling his TSLA stock to buy BTC. For example, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor suggested: “If the goal is diversification, an alternate strategy to consider is converting the TSLA balance sheet to a Bitcoin Standard and purchasing $25 billion in BTC. That would deliver diversification, inflation protection, & more upside for all investors in a tax-efficient manner.”Former Tesla employee Michael Rihani, now working as the crypto product lead at Jack Dorsey’s company Square Inc., tweeted to his old boss:Yes, sell to receive $10B+ USD and buy bitcoin with it. You’ll turn that $10B+ into $100B+ and can use the proceeds to (1) increase the odds of fulfilling the Tesla and Spacex missions and (2) helping even more people and countries.Some of Musk’s followers are hopeful that the Tesla billionaire will put some money into the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin. Musk, also known as the Dogefather, has long been a supporter of DOGE, calling it “the people’s crypto.” He recently revealed that he personally owns three cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin.Not everyone was happy about the poll, however. Some were concerned that selling 10% of Musk’s Tesla position will tank the TSLA stock’s price on Monday morning. Others thought it was simply a poor idea to let Twitter users decide what to do with so much wealth.U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee who is behind the unrealized gains tax provision, responded to Musk’s poll Saturday evening:Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll. It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.Last week, Musk offered to sell his Tesla shares if it would solve the world hunger problem. Responding to a comment by the director of the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP) that 2% of his wealth could solve world hunger, Musk wrote: “If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.” However, he emphasized: “But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.”Musk’s shareholding in Tesla comes to about 170.5 million shares as of June 30. Selling 10% of his stock would amount to about $21 billion based on Tesla’s current stock price.What do you think of Elon Musk’s Twitter poll? Also, should he use the sale proceeds to buy bitcoin?

358,US Lawmakers Urge SEC to Permit Trading of Bitcoin Spot ETFs,"Nov 4, 2021","U.S. lawmakers have called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Since the SEC has approved the trading of bitcoin futures ETFs, the lawmakers said it “should no longer have concerns with bitcoin spot ETFs and should show a similar willingness to permit the trading of bitcoin spot ETFs.”U.S. Representatives Tom Emmer and Darren Soto sent a bipartisan letter to the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, Wednesday regarding bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So far, the SEC has approved two bitcoin futures ETFs but has yet to approve any bitcoin spot ETF.Rep. Emmer said:The SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been unacceptable. While the trading of bitcoin futures ETFs is a great step forward for the millions of American investors who have been demanding regulatory clarity, it does not make sense that bitcoin spot ETFs cannot also commence trading.Noting that the SEC approved two bitcoin futures ETFs, Reps Emmer and Soto wrote: “We question why, if you are comfortable allowing trading in an ETF based on derivatives contracts, you are not equally or more comfortable allowing trading to commence in ETFs based on spot bitcoin.”They explained, “Bitcoin spot ETFs are based directly on the asset, which inherently provides more protection for investors,” adding that futures products “are potentially much more volatile than a bitcoin spot ETF and may impose substantially higher fees on investors.”Referencing the SEC’s previous reasoning for disallowing spot bitcoin ETFs, the lawmakers asserted that “Since the SEC no longer has concerns with bitcoin futures ETFs,” then “it presumably has changed its view about the underlying spot bitcoin market because bitcoin futures are, by definition, a derivative of the underlying Bitcoin spot market.” They continued:The SEC should no longer have concerns with bitcoin spot ETFs and should show a similar willingness to permit the trading of bitcoin spot ETFs.The letter also notes that while the SEC continues to deny bitcoin ETFs, “numerous spot bitcoin investment vehicles have been offered,” with more than $40 billion in assets under management (AUM).“However, because these products have been unable to register as ETFs with the SEC, public trading typically occurs at a value that is not equivalent to net asset value, and in fact, these products have recently been trading at steep discounts to their net asset value,” the congressmen stressed. They elaborated:Permitting futures-based ETFs while simultaneously continuing to deny spot-based ETFs would further perpetuate these discounts and clearly go against the SEC’s core mission of protecting investors.The letter concludes: “The SEC is in a position to approve bitcoin futures ETFs, as reflected by the trading of these products, so it should also be in a position to approve bitcoin spot ETFs.”What do you think about the SEC approving bitcoin futures ETFs but not bitcoin spot ETFs?

360,"Silk Road 2 Admin Forfeits $667,000 in Bitcoin to British Law Enforcement","Nov 3, 2021","According to reports, the founder of the now-defunct Silk Road 2 marketplace has forfeited more than half-million dollars worth of bitcoin to British authorities. White’s Silk Road 2 admin handle was called “Cthulhu,” and he also dubbed himself as “DPR2.”In April 2019, Bitcoin.com News reported on Thomas White, the lead administrator of the now-defunct Silk Road 2 darknet marketplace (DNM), getting sentenced to five years in prison. The Silk Road 2 (SR2) DNM was the original Silk Road’s successor, after the first Silk Road administrator was taken into custody. The 26-year-old White ran the DNM under the names “Cthulhu” and “DPR2,” and was eventually tracked when he ordered a package from the SR2 marketplace itself.Sky News reports that White has been forced to hand over £490,000 ($667,000) worth of bitcoin from his net proceeds. The prosecutors continued to monitor White’s finances after he was jailed and the National Crime Agency (NCA) believes he made roughly £1.5 million ($2,048,100) from his SR2 operations. Law enforcement estimates that the SR2 pulled in roughly $8 million in bitcoin every month after it launched.Reportedly, SR2 did not have any official affiliations with the original Silk Road market, but appeared online approximately 30 days after the site was seized in October 2013. At the court hearing last week, White was described as being affiliated with members of the original Silk Road, and the NCA says he used his reputation to his advantage.“Thomas White was a well-regarded member of the original Silk Road hierarchy,” Tyrone Surgeon, an NCA spokesperson said. “He used this to his advantage when the original site was closed down and profited significantly from his criminal activity. This case proves that crime doesn’t pay – not only has he spent the last two years in prison, he now has to hand over nearly £500,000,” Surgeon added.So far White has served two years of his five-year and four-month prison sentence alongside forfeiting the $667,000 worth of bitcoin. The SR2 administrator was charged with money laundering, drug trafficking, and possession of illegal images. “This has been a complex, international investigation and highlights that we will use every tool at our disposal to disrupt organised criminals from profiting from their crime,” Surgeon added in his statement.**Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article contained a typo that said “half-billion” and was replaced with “half-million,” in terms of the size of White’s bitcoin forfeiture. What do you think about the SR2 administrator Thomas White being forced to hand over more than a half-million dollars worth of bitcoin?

The mayor is currently trying to build his city into a bitcoin capital of the world.The pro-bitcoin mayor of the U.S. city of Miami, Francis Suarez, tweeted Tuesday that he is going to take 100% of his next paycheck in bitcoin.His statement was in response to a challenge by Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano asking on Twitter: “Who is going to be the first American politician to accept their salary in bitcoin?”In his tweet, Mayor Suarez asked Mike Sarasti, CIO and director of Innovation & Tech of the city of Miami, to help make it happen.

364,"Spending a String of 20,000 BTC — 2 Bitcoin Whale Transactions Move Over $1.2 Billion","Nov 2, 2021","On November 1, at block height 707,639, a blockchain parser caught two bitcoin whale transfers that moved approximately 19,876 bitcoin worth $1.2 billion in the mix of 2,819 transactions. Interestingly, the owner used a similar splitting mechanism the old school mining whale blockchain parsers caught, spending strings of 20 block rewards throughout 2020 and 2021.Bitcoin whales are mysterious animals because in a blockchain world of pseudonymity we only see them when they move. Last year and this year as well, Bitcoin.com News has hunted a specific whale entity that spent thousands of bitcoin mined in 2010.Every single time the whale spent the decade-old bitcoin that sat idle the whole time, the entity spent exactly 20 block rewards or 1,000 BTC. After the transfer, the wallets holding 1,000 BTC dispersed the funds into smaller-sized wallets.According to the creator of btcparser.com, the close to 20K BTC transferred at block height 707,639 on November 1 shared similar splitting mechanics with the “20×50 awakenings.” The blockchain parser’s owner would guess that the entity spending the two transactions could be the same person or organization.The special transactions stemming from block height 707,639 derived from the bitcoin addresses “15kEr” and “1PfaY.” The 15kEr address transferred 9,900.87 BTC, while 1PfaY spent 9,975.31 BTC.The two transactions were filtered among 2,819 BTC transfers with 6,406 inputs recorded in block 707,639. The output total in that block was 9,587 with 78,704.53 BTC dispersed. The two transactions stemming from 15kEr and 1PfaY, represented more than 25% of the BTC processed in block 707,639.After the funds were sent, the nearly 20K BTC was split into 200 wallets with 100 BTC each. Then the bitcoin whale’s funds were split again into much smaller wallets until they finally consolidated into different amounts.Data from blockchair.com’s Privacy-o-meter for Bitcoin Transactions tool shows the wallet that sent the 9,975.31 BTC got a score of 60 or “moderate.” This is because matched addresses were identified and blockchair.com’s tool notes that “matching significantly reduces the anonymity of addresses.” The 9,900.87 BTC spend suffers from the same tracking vulnerabilities as matched addresses were also identified.Alongside the close to 20K BTC transfer in two separate transactions, 59 blocks later 50 sleeping bitcoins that had sat idle since April 28, 2011, were transferred at block height 707,698. The 50 BTC sat idle for over ten years since the day they were mined and when they were transferred, the exchange rate for the block reward of 50 BTC was just over $3 million.Blockchair.com’s privacy tool indicates the transaction got a score of 0 or “critical.” A critical score means that the tool “identified issues [that] significantly endanger the privacy of the parties involved.”What do you think about the 20,000 bitcoin sent in two transactions at block height 707,639? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

365,Paraguay Eyed as New Bitcoin Mining Destination,"Nov 2, 2021","Paraguay is one of the destinations being considered by various companies for setting up their bitcoin mining operations. Last week, Chinese company Future Fintech announced formal plans to build a bitcoin mining facility in the country, explaining they were determining the best location for the upcoming farm. In June, local media declared that there were eight Chinese economic groups interested in coming to the country.Paraguay, an often overlooked country of South America, has recently been in the sights of mining institutions interested in establishing operations in the country. Paraguay presents several advantages for these groups, like an abundant supply of unused hydro-electrical power that could be put to work. Bitcoin mining activity has been stigmatized as a “dirty” industry, but having this much clean energy, companies could mine without worrying about the effect on the environment.Future Fintech, a Chinese company that was invited to Paraguay, already has plans to establish a bitcoin mining facility in the country. According to a PR statement issued last week, CEO of the company Shanchun Huang will be reviewing the facts to determine the route the company will take to make this a reality. Huang stated:We plan to carefully assess this development opportunity in Paraguay. We will work with our local consultant to review Paraguay’s hydroelectric power and clean energy resources, locations for developing a mining farm and the preferential policy treatment that we might receive for our capital investment.The company also made a special mention of the support that the Paraguayan government is giving to the cryptocurrency mining business.Many more companies could be secretly planning to move their operations to Paraguay, more so after the bitcoin mining exodus that China produced with its latest cryptocurrency crackdown. In July, CEO of the bitcoin mining company Digital Assets, Juanjo Benítez Rickmann, stated there were at least eight Chinese economic groups interested in Paraguay, but he didn’t expand on the identities of these groups.Furthermore, Rickmann stated he had knowledge that one of these groups was already in the country and that it had plans to install 90K miners in the coming months. The 5,500 MW of unused power Paraguay is said to produce could signal the start of a bitcoin mining era in the nation.What do you think about Paraguay as a potential mining Mecca?

366,'Bitcoin Is Worth Zero' — Kenyan Communication Strategist Warns African Investors to Be Wary,"Nov 2, 2021","A Kenyan communications strategist, Mwotia Ciugu, has told African investors to be wary of investing in bitcoin which he claims is worth zero. In an op-ed published by The Elephant, Ciugu insists bitcoin (BTC) is structurally incapable of delivering on its promise of becoming an alternative store of value or a hedge against inflation. In addition, the strategist also claims bitcoin fails both as a currency and an investment.Although he concedes that Africa has one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates, Ciugu cautions, however, that the top cryptocurrency’s volatility and scalability issues mean it cannot act as a currency. Ciugu is quoted explaining:Bitcoin fails as a currency because of two things: volatility and scalability concerns. In its 12 years of existence, bitcoin has maintained extremely high levels of volatility i.e. 60 per cent to 100 per cent annualized.To further support this point, Ciugu makes reference to the U.S. dollar which he claims “has an annualized volatility of 17 [percent].” Concerning the crypto asset’s scalability problems, Ciugu predictably regurgitates the common arguments about bitcoin’s inefficient use of electricity and how this disqualifies it as a currency for day-to-day transactions.Meanwhile, the strategist denies that bitcoin is now being used extensively in El Salvador, the first country in the world to declare bitcoin legal tender. According to Ciugu, the U.S. dollar is still the dominant currency in El Salvador. Despite putting forward these arguments, Ciugu surprisingly agrees that sending remittances via bitcoin is more cost-effective than using regular sending channels. He explained:The use of bitcoin in that country is primarily for remittances by citizens working abroad to their families back home. These citizens rely on bitcoin for cross-border money transfers to avoid the high costs that come with such transactions, and also because most citizens of El Salvador, i.e. 70 [percent], don’t have bank accounts.On why he thinks the cryptocurrency is worth zero, Ciugu uses billionaire investor Warren Buffet’s past comments about bitcoin to argue his point. In his previous remarks, Buffet had intimated the crypto asset had hallmarks of a pyramid scheme because it produces nothing. Just like Buffet, the strategist also believes bitcoin investors have no expectations of making any future earnings except through engaging in zero-sum games with other speculators.The strategist also makes reference to how bitcoin crashed when Elon Musk voiced his concerns about the crypto asset’s energy use. Such a reaction according to Ciugu means bitcoin is more susceptible to sentiments than actual fundamentals.The strategist ends this long article by conceding that bitcoin will probably hit the US$100,000 mark in the near future as some analysts are predicting. However, Ciugu argues that even if bitcoin were to reach such a milestone, this will have “no bearing on the intractable truths” he has articulated.Do you agree with Ciugu’s views?

367,Bitcoin Mining Operation Genesis Digital Assets Announces New Data Center in West Texas,"Nov 1, 2021","Following a number of ASIC mining rig acquisitions from the manufacturer Canaan, the bitcoin mining operation Genesis Digital Assets announced on Monday that the firm is developing an industrial-scale bitcoin mining data center in West Texas. According to the announcement, Genesis says that the new facility will have 300 megawatts of capacity with a “low carbon footprint.”The mining firm Genesis Digital Assets has announced the launch of a new bitcoin mining facility that will be located in West Texas. The Genesis data center will get energy from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The entity ERCOT is a large power supplier in Texas and statistics say the firm supplies 90 percent of the state’s electric load. Genesis stresses that the new data center with 300 megawatts will showcase “sustainable infrastructure, high efficiency, and a low carbon footprint.”The Texas facility announcement follows a slew of mining rig acquisitions Genesis took part in with the Chinese ASIC manufacturer Canaan. In August, Bitcoin.com News reported on Genesis buying 20,000 ASIC miners from Canaan and the firm was given the option to acquire 180,000 ASIC mining rigs at a later date. Genesis details that the new operation in West Texas will “create job opportunities” and provide “work for local contractors.”Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, the executive chairman and co-founder of Genesis Digital Assets, confirms that the new facility will help bolster local employment opportunities. “As we continue our rapid expansion plans in the United States, we remain committed to our sustainability and social commitments, by identifying ways to power our industrial-scale bitcoin mining farms with renewable energy and create job opportunities for the local communities in which we operate,” Mirakhmedov said in a statement.Genesis recently signed a significant procurement deal and also raised more than $550 million in financing this year. The recent Genesis funding was led by Paradigm, and Alameda Research, Ribbit, Electric Capital, NYDIG, Stoneridge, Skybridge, and Kingsway Capital participated. The mining operation hopes to run “1.4 GW of new data centers by 2023” and as of today, Genesis maintains over 170 megawatts or 3.8 Exahashes (EH/s) of dedicated hashpower toward the Bitcoin (BTC) network.“We’re full speed ahead on our mission to provide the infrastructure that will power the future of money,” said Andrey Kim, the COO and co-founder of Genesis Digital Assets. “This new data center marks another key milestone as we work towards executing on our big picture vision.”Meanwhile, a number of bitcoin mining operations have been migrating to the state of Texas like Bitmain, Argo Blockchain, and EZ Blockchain. Just recently a number of oil producers met with bitcoin mining industry heavyweights to see how the two industries could collaborate. Texas has been steadily transitioning into a major bitcoin mining hub during the last year.What do you think about Genesis Digital Assets announcing a new bitcoin data center in West Texas?

The seizure was led by the national police, officers from the national power company, and personnel from Sunacrip.Authorities seized over a hundred miners that were operating illegally in a clandestine farm located in a residential zone in Miranda, a central state in Venezuela. According to reports from local media, authorities located the farm due to the strain it was imposing on the power distribution system in the area. This prompted an inspection by the police and authorities from both the national power company (Corpoelec) and the national cryptocurrency watchdog (Sunacrip) to check for unreported mining activity.The farm was dismantled and the mining equipment was seized by Sunacrip. Mining cryptocurrencies is a completely legal operation in Venezuela, but it requires a series of permits issued by Sunacrip designed to protect the electrical system from potential strains. However, due to past occurrences, some miners just choose to mine in an underground way, avoiding the oversight of Sunacrip, and giving opportunity for these events to happen.Sunacrip has repeatedly made calls for miners to register with the organization, giving guarantees to miners.This is not the only seizure these authorities have carried out in the state. 165 mining machines were seized from a warehouse in the same state, that also lacked the necessary permits to operate in the area. Like the most recent incident, this seizure was also a joint action of police forces and Sunacrip officers. This year, Sunacrip had to require that these visits should always be made in the company of a Sunacrip officer, to avoid possible irregularities in the inspection process.Further, in June, more than 400 miners were seized due to a lack of permits when transporting the machines. The authorities confiscated the mining cargo at a road checkpoint.But even registered Venezuelan miners have had problems with power company officers and Sunacrip before. In August, officers from the national power company cut the power supply to registered Bitcoin miners in strange circumstances in the state of Carabobo. Sunacrip was able to mediate between the affected parties, and miners were reconnected to the power grid after a week.What do you think about the seizure of bitcoin mining machines in Venezuela?

370,Elon Musk's Warning About Government Spending and Unrealized Gains Tax Proposal Highlights Benefits of Bitcoin,"Oct 31, 2021","A warning by Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk about the mounting national debt in the U.S., government spending, and the proposal to tax unrealized capital gains has highlighted the benefits of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin.Tesla CEO Elon Musk made several tweets about the U.S. national debt and government spending last week. He also warned against the proposal to tax unrealized capital gains, aimed at billionaires, which was scuttled Friday amid questions about whether it would even be constitutional.Musk believes that if the proposal were to go ahead, the government would not stop at billionaires. “Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you,” he tweeted early last week.Commenting on a Washington Post article stating that he would “pay as much as $50 billion under the tax over its first five years, while Bezos could pay as much as $44 billion,” the Tesla CEO tweeted to his 61.7 million followers: “According to their own estimates, this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill. Where will the other 90% come from? The answer is you.”The Tesla boss proceeded to explain that the U.S. national debt is currently about $28.9 trillion or $229K per taxpayer, asserting that even if all billionaires are taxed at 100%, it would only make a small dent in the debt number. “The rest must come from the general public,” he stressed. “This is basic math.” Musk elaborated:Spending is the real problem … U.S. federal debt/GDP was 56% in 2000, now it is 126% & climbing fast.Musk’s comments have drawn much attention. At the time of writing, his tweet has been liked 34K times and retweeted 7,123 times.Some people strongly disagree with Musk, accusing the Tesla billionaire of not understanding economics and avoiding paying taxes. “Has anyone explained money creation to Elon?” one person tweeted.Several pointed out that his companies are heavily subsidized by the government. One person wrote: “How do you think you became the richest man in the world? Could’ve been the $5 billion the US government gave you to start your companies?” Another said, “Spacex and Tesla only exist because of government spending.”A third person acknowledged that “Taxation is theft,” but told Musk: “You’re a hypocrite … Pay back the billions in government subsidies you received first and then you will be able to argue against taxation.”Meanwhile, many people agreed with Musk on the government spending problem and mounting national debt, stating that this is why they put their money in crypto. Marcelo Claure, CEO of Softbank Group International, simply replied, “Totally agree.”Lawyer John Deaton described: “The politicians’ intent is so transparent. Classic divide & conquer strategy by employing class warfare. It’s only against the billionaires – Until it isn’t. Do the math.”Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong agreed with Musk, stating: “Exactly — it’s gotten completely out of hand. If they are going to keep printing to service the debt and cover the deficit, then this will accelerate the move into crypto.”The mayor of the city of Miami, Francis Suarez, who has been trying to build his city into a bitcoin hub, chimed in:It’s why bitcoin has become so valuable. An unmanipulatable currency/store of value.On Sunday, Musk said that he would sell his Tesla shares if it would solve the world hunger problem. Responding to a comment by the director of the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP) that 2% of his wealth could solve world hunger, Musk wrote: “If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.” However, he emphasized: “But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.”What do you think about Elon Musk’s comments?

371,"Rich Dad Poor Dad's Robert Kiyosaki Warns US Sliding Into Depression After Giant Crash, Recommends Bitcoin","Oct 31, 2021","Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has warned that the U.S. is “sliding into depression.” He said that a giant crash is coming, after which “a new depression” will follow. Bitcoin is among his recommendations for smart investing.Famous author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has warned of a new depression in the U.S. following a “giant crash.” Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.The famous author tweeted Friday that the U.S. is “sliding into depression.” He said President Joe Biden and the Fed are “ripping off people,” noting that they “need inflation to prevent new depression.” Kiyosaki stressed: “Inflation rips off the poor. Inflation makes [the] rich richer. Biden and Fed corrupt.” He continued:Prepare: Giant crash then new depression. Be smart: Buy, gold, silver, bitcoin.A number of people have voiced similar concerns about inflation. Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla) said on Fox News Sunday that Americans should be furious with the way Democrats are handling their money, adding that President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will only worsen the country’s “ridiculous” inflation.“If you look at what they’re talking about with this — name whatever the bill is — all it’s going to do is cause more inflation … Look at what it’s doing to poor families in this country, with gas prices up 55%. Go to the grocery store, food prices are up. It’s all caused by government spending,” he opined.This is not the first time Kiyosaki has warned that a major crash is coming. In September, he said: “Giant stock market crash coming October. Why? Treasury and Fed short of T-bills.” He noted at the time that “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash too,” adding that cash is “best for picking up bargains after [the] crash.” The famous author emphasized that he is not selling gold, silver or bitcoin.Kiyosaki has been recommending BTC to investors for quite some time. Earlier this month, he said: “I love bitcoin because I do not trust Fed, Treasury, or Wall Street.”When the price of BTC rose above $60K, Kiyosaki tweeted: “Future very bright. Celebrate yet be cautious. I am waiting for a pullback before investing more.” In August, he said bitcoin was the investment with “the greatest upside.”What do you think about Robert Kiyosaki’s warning? Let us know in the comments section below.

372,Celebrating the Seminal Bitcoin White Paper Satoshi Nakamoto Published 13 Years Ago Today,"Oct 31, 2021","All around the world cryptocurrency supporters and proponents of blockchain technology are celebrating the 13th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper. The summary of the inventor’s creation was published on metzdowd.com’s Cryptography Mailing List on Halloween 2008, as it gave birth to an asset with a market valuation of over $1 trillion and sparked the creation of over 10,000+ cryptocurrencies that followed Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovative design.13 years ago at approximately 2:10 p.m. (EDT), Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper, a summary of the innovative network and native cryptocurrency that changed the world. The 12-part white paper starts off with an indented paragraph called an abstract which explains that Bitcoin is a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”When the paper was first published, academia and computer scientists worldwide were not aware that Bitcoin’s inventor solved a problem that had plagued computer scientists for years — the “Byzantine Generals Problem” or the “Byzantine Fault.” Two weeks after Nakamoto published the white paper on Halloween 2008, he told the pseudonymous member of metzdowd.com’s Cryptography Mailing List, James A. Donald, the inventor solved the problem. Nakamoto said on November 13, 2008:The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine generals’ problem.The benefits of Nakamoto’s paper were clear and the advantages of triple-entry bookkeeping became apparent to people who studied the inventor’s paper and witnessed the launch of the network on January 3, 2009. Satoshi also told Donald a few days earlier, that the “proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem, and to knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust anyone.”Since then, Nakamoto’s paper gave birth to the Bitcoin network and the myriad of blockchains that followed. Moreover, the white paper is leveraged in academia quite a bit these days as it is referenced in many crypto network white papers and cited 17,201 times on Google Scholar. It is safe to say there hasn’t been another white paper as prolific and innovative as Nakamoto’s since its release on October 31, 2008. It quite literally invoked the next level of ledger accounting systems as triple-entry bookkeeping — in contrast to single and double-ledger systems — offers a concept that is nearly trustless, if we remove trusting the autonomous system.Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and users can add as much privacy as they want as the system offers both public transparency and privacy at its core. “The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party,” the Bitcoin white paper details. “The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.”Just as the printing press changed society for the better and allowed people to learn without an apprenticeship and just as the combustion engine made traveling a whole lot faster, Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin invention is one that has forever changed the world.In the beginning skeptics, bankers, and governments mocked and laughed at the nascent technology and in time they even tried to attack crypto’s exponential growth. These days, the biggest financial institutions in the world are trying to adapt to Nakamoto’s concepts and governments are trying to produce their own versions of blockchain technology.The white paper is now a very important paper that is hosted on the websites of large corporations, city web portals, and cited as one of “the seminal works” of computer science. On Lex Fridman’s podcast at the end of April 2020, Twitter CEO and Square co-founder, Jack Dorsey, told Fridman the white paper is like “poetry.”“I think the Bitcoin whitepaper is one of the most seminal works of computer science in the last 20 or 30 years,” Dorsey said.Bitcoin.com News readers that are interested in reading the innovative Bitcoin white paper can read Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous paper in its entirety here. What do you think about the 13th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

373,Finance Author Says $100K Bitcoin Prices Not 'So Far-Fetched — Don’t Rule It Out',"Oct 30, 2021","Throughout 2021, there’s been a number of people who have said they expect bitcoin to reach $100K by the end of this year. In more recent times, the six-digit bitcoin price forecasts continue as people are now saying a sudden move to $100K “doesn’t seem so far-fetched.”Many bitcoin speculators and investors believe the road to $100K is not only probable, but guaranteed. Bitcoin.com News has covered numerous individuals, experts, analysts, and advisors this year that have said bitcoin (BTC) is likely to reach the six-digit price range by the year’s end.As the leading crypto asset, in terms of market capitalization, hovers above the $60K zone, many still believe the $100K target is inevitable. The financial institution Standard Chartered predicted at the beginning of September that BTC’s value could reach $100K by the end of the year or early 2022.The web portal investing.com recently discussed whether or not BTC reaching six-digits per unit is possible. Meanwhile, Yahoo Finance contributor, Javier David, an editor “focused on markets and the economy” explained on October 21, that “suddenly, a bitcoin move to $100K doesn’t seem so farfetched.” David said “bitcoin ‘hodlers’ are looking awfully prescient these days,” and as far as BTC hitting $100K is concerned, the editor says “don’t rule it out.” David’s Yahoo Finance editorial adds:It’s hard to deny that the nascent ETF boom is a milestone in bitcoin’s grudging yet growing acceptance. Is $100,000 — or even higher — the next stop? Don’t rule it out.On Twitter, the Youtube channel Mmcrypto’s official Twitter account said on October 23:It’s much more likely for bitcoin to hit $100K this year [than] $40K.On October 27, Dennis Porter tweeted: “I can’t believe it, but bitcoin is on sale today. 12% off from ATH. Maybe last chance at these prices before $100K.” Last Tuesday, the creator of the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) bitcoin price model, Plan B, told his 1.2 million Twitter followers that the “bitcoin bull market, 2nd leg has started.”In an interview with Blockworks, Wallstreetbets (WSB) founder Jaime Rogozinski said that the infamous Jordan Belfort asked him this past March where the WSB founder envisioned BTC’s price leading to by the end of 2021. “I told him $100,000 by the end of this year,” Rogozinski explained in his recent interview.It seems quite a lot of crypto enthusiasts have the six-digit price range for BTC on the top of their heads. On October 23, the popular host of the Unchained podcast, Laura Shin, talked about six-digit prices with the S2F author Plan B. The S2F author told Shin his “bitcoin price floor predictions for November ($98K) and December ($135K).”What do you think about bitcoin (BTC) hitting $100K by the year’s end? Let us know what you think about these predictions in the comments section below.

374,The Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Case: Long-Awaited Kleiman v. Wright Trial Begins Next Week in Miami,"Oct 30, 2021","On Monday, November 1, the long-awaited Kleiman v. Wright trial will begin as a federal jury plans to determine the relationship between Dave Kleiman and Craig Wright. The Kleiman estate is asking for $11.4 billion, alongside the return of intellectual property (IP) or its fair market value. While Bitcoinsv proponents and Wright’s fans believe the trial will finally prove Wright’s ostensible Satoshi claims, others believe it may shed some light on proving his theories false.Well over three years ago, the Kleiman estate decided to take Craig Wright to court over the alleged relationship with the now deceased, computer forensics expert Dave Kleiman. The high-profile billion-dollar bitcoin lawsuit started on February 14, 2018, as it is alleged that Kleiman took part in multiple business relationships that involved Wright. The Kleiman estate accused Wright of perpetrating “a scheme against Dave’s estate to seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the Bitcoin technology.”The court will debate on whether or not Wright’s or the Kleiman estate’s arguments are valid and the existence of 1.1 million bitcoins reportedly kept in trusts. After close to four years of deliberation, the case is going to trial in Florida and will begin on Monday, November 1. The case is one of the most high-profile lawsuits in the country and one of the most popular court dockets searched in Florida. The billion-dollar lawsuit has been of great interest to the cryptosphere as well because it could reveal whether Wright or his detractors have been correct all along.Wright’s comrades and Bitcoinsv (BSV) proponents wholeheartedly believe the Australian’s story, and they think that he will be victorious during the upcoming trial. On October 30, the day before Halloween, the billionaire Calvin Ayre tweeted that the “trial will change everything you think you know about Bitcoin.”Furthermore, Coingeek’s Kurt Wuckert Jr. claims that the court case will be “the trial of the century.” Wuckert Jr., appeared in a Ask Me Anything (AMA) live stream this past week and discussed the upcoming trial in Miami. The live stream host noted that there was a lack of media coverage concerning the Kleiman v. Wright trial. Wuckert Jr. said that the media blackout over the upcoming Kleiman v. Wright trial could mean one of two things. Wuckert Jr. stressed:They are so deeply entrenched in the fact that it’s impossible that Craig Wright is Satoshi or it’s plainly malicious and part of a coordinated blackout campaign.Meanwhile, Wright’s detractors and people who don’t believe his Satoshi Nakamoto claims, have been discussing the upcoming trial as well. On October 12, Wizsec Bitcoin Research tweeted about the upcoming trial and “Craig Wright’s post-Kleiman narrative.”“Kleiman v. Wright is a *civil* dispute to determine what Craig owes Dave’s estate (even though the funds are imaginary, Craig was still ensnaring Dave’s relatives in his schemes with lofty promises). It has zero bearing on any third parties,” Wizsec remarked. Wizsec’s Twitter thread continued to dissect Wright’s claims by adding:​​There’s a very real possibility the jury might order Craig to pay BILLIONS that he never had, all because he can’t admit to having made the whole thing up. It’s making a mockery of the legal system. It’s also f***ing poetry.The Twitter account of Arthur van Pelt, the author of the web portal called “The Faketoshi Fraud Timeline,” has been chastising Wright’s claims on a regular basis via social media. On October 30, Arthur van Pelt said: “You better ask yourself, why is the whole Faketoshi saga one massive trail of lies, forgeries, deception and morons enabling that sh**? Maybe because it’s centered around a cosplaying con man who attracts only likewise charlatans? I know the answer already, do you?” The critic has been following the case for quite some time as he wholeheartedly believes “Craig has nothing.”Whatever the case may be and how the jury decides on this trial, by and large, the outcome will be interesting, to say the least. Both parties will have their say in court and Wright’s proponents and detractors will be watching the outcome with great intensity.What do you think about the upcoming Kleiman v. Wright trial? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

375,"Hive Blockchain Secures Order for 6,500 Next-Generation Bitcoin Miners From Canaan","Oct 30, 2021","On October 29, the publicly listed firm Canaan announced the mining manufacturer has secured a follow-on purchase order from the mining operator Hive Blockchain for 6,500 units of Canaan’s next-generation Avalon mining rigs. Hive expects to increase the operation’s hashrate from 1.2 exahash per second (EH/s) to 3 EH/s by March 2022. This week the Nasdaq-listed Hive Blockchain (Nasdaq:HIVE) and Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) announced that Hive secured a follow-on purchase order for 6,500 Avalon miners from Canaan. According to the announcement, the shipment of the 6,500 mining rigs manufactured by Canaan will be shipped in three tranches.3,000 miners will be delivered in December 2021, 3,100 miners in January 2022, and an additional 400 Avalon miners by February 2022. Hive had already acquired 10,400 miners from Canaan in January and August 2021.In recent times, Hive announced the company is constructing expansions to its largest data center campus in New Brunswick, Canada. Hive said it aims to provide the New Brunswick site with 40 additional megawatts. The mining operation mines both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) and it operates a total of five mining facilities in countries like Iceland, Sweden, and Canada.Frank Holmes, the executive chairman of Hive Blockchain said the company is pleased to bolster its relationship with the crypto mining rig manufacturer. “We are pleased to be building on our strategic alliances with leading ASIC manufacturer Canaan to achieve our goals and drive value for our shareholders, while executing on a transaction that increases our cash flow and green mining capacity,” Holmes said in a statement. The mining operation’s chairman added:Hive currently has approximately 1.2 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin mining capacity, and with this new purchase, Hive’s bitcoin ASIC pipeline will be at 2 EH/s by December 2021, and 3 EH/s by March 2022.During the last two months, both bitcoin’s (BTC) and ethereum’s (ETH) price has made both crypto assets far more profitable to mine. BTC’s price has given older generation mining rigs new life and companies that mine crypto assets are taking full advantage. Besides Hive Blockchain a number of other firms have been placing orders with ASIC manufacturing companies like Bitmain, Canaan, and Microbt for next-generation units.At the end of August, Genesis Digital Assets acquired 20,000 bitcoin mining rigs from Canaan, and the company also has the option to buy 180,000 more units from Canaan going forward. Canaan shares are exchanging hands for $8.72 on Friday while Hive Blockchain shares are swapping for $3.85 per share. While Canaan’s shares are down 0.19% today, Hive’s shares, on the other hand, are up 0.15%.What do you think about Hive purchasing 6,500 miners from Canaan?

376,Big Miners and Holders Keep Accumulating Bitcoin: Kraken's 'Shocktober' Report,"Oct 29, 2021","Mining operators and holders keep accumulating Bitcoin, according to the latest Kraken intelligence report, titled “Shocktober.” In the report, several metrics allude to a bullish view for the months to come. In contrast, mining pool contributors and small miners have taken profits, these being more prone to sell due to market movements. A new report issued by the intelligence division of the U.S.-based exchange Kraken suggests that mining operators and long-time holders are actively contributing to bitcoin’s rally this month. The report, called Shocktober, states that mining companies and behemoth holders are creating a supply shock in the market that has fueled the short-term rally during this month.According to a metric called the 1-year revived supply, which reflects the movements of coins from long-term bitcoin holders, these investors are not taking profits from this rally. The metric fell to 2,293.5 bitcoin, the lowest level since August.Also, another metric, BTC Hodl Waves, which divides bitcoin sales by type of holder, found out that early investors of “old coins” (bitcoin with more than 6 months of no movement) rose by 10.9%. This implies that long-term investors didn’t sell their bitcoins during September’s selloff.The mining situation is also relevant for Kraken. According to their investigations, there are two distinct patterns occurring. Big miners like Riot, Marathon, Bitfarms, Argo, and Hut8, have continued to stack bitcoin even in unfavorable market moments. This is evidenced by another metric, the 0-hop supply, that makes reference to the addresses that receive the mining subsidy directly from coinbase transactions.This metric has risen almost 50% since September, with the big mining firms, now located mostly in America, holding more than 20.4K bitcoin that are unlikely to be sold into the market anytime soon. This contributes to the mentioned supply shock. However, small participants in the market have taken profits.The 1-hop supply, an indicator that attempts to track the movements of small miners and contributors that get paid as part of a mining pool, shows these miners have unloaded some of their profits. But, if this trend suffers a reversal, it could cause an even bigger supply shock that would lead the market to even higher prices towards the end of this year.What do you think about Kraken’s “Shocktober” report? Tell us in the comments section below.

378,UK Police Seize Bitcoin Worth $2.8 Million From Teen Operating Scam Website,"Oct 28, 2021","British police have seized bitcoin worth almost $3 million from a teenager who set up a fake website to scam consumers. “At the time they were worth £200,000. They are now worth a little over £2 million.”British police have arrested a 17-year-old boy from South Lincolnshire and seized bitcoin worth almost $3 million from him, BBC News reported Tuesday. The authorities cannot name the boy for legal reasons.Prosecutor Sam Skinner said the teen set up a fake website that was almost identical to the official site of Love2shop, which sells gift vouchers.He then paid to advertise on Google, resulting in his bogus site appearing above the genuine site in search results. The scam site duped Love2shop users into entering their personal details. The prosecutor said:People were duped into clicking on his website thinking they were accessing the official site.The teen took the site down after a week when Love2shop began investigating him following a complaint from a customer.He stole £6,500 ($8,954) worth of vouchers and used the proceeds to buy bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, Lincoln Crown Court was told.When he was arrested in August last year, police found 48 bitcoins and smaller numbers of other cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, this amount of BTC is worth almost $3 million based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Skinner said:At the time they were worth £200,000. They are now worth a little over £2 million.Upon further investigation, police additionally found over 12,000 credit card numbers stored on the teen’s computer and details of 197 Paypal accounts.The teenager admitted to charges of money laundering between April 9 and 16, 2020, and fraud totaling £6,539 by false representation.Judge Catarina Sjolin Knight ruled that he benefited from his crimes by £2,141,720 and ordered that amount to be confiscated from his assets. The teenager was also handed a 12-month rehabilitation order. “If he was an adult he would be going inside,” the judge said.What do you think about this case?

380,The Many Facts That Indicate Bitcoin's Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Won't Ever Come Back,"Oct 27, 2021","On January 3, 2022, the Bitcoin network will be celebrating its 13th year of life after its creator Satoshi Nakamoto kick-started the protocol. The creator of Bitcoin has always been the community’s most famous and mysterious character. Roughly ten years ago, Satoshi logged off, never to return and it’s very likely the inventor won’t ever come back.Satoshi Nakamoto invented the Bitcoin network and released the technology’s white paper on Halloween (October 31) 2008. The paper was authored by “Satoshi Nakamoto” using the email “satoshin@gmx.com” and the creator also attached the web domain name “bitcoin.org” to the paper.The name “Satoshi Nakamoto” is of Japanese descent and it’s widely considered a pseudonym or a falsified name. It is assumed that Nakamoto’s birthday is April 5, 1975, as the date is displayed on the inventor’s P2P Foundation profile. If the birth date is correct, Nakamoto would be 46 years old today.Over the years a great number of sleuths have made it their mission to discover the inventor’s identity. Although, Satoshi Nakamoto is likely deceased and there are many reasons why people would believe Bitcoin’s inventor is no longer with us. In the past, Bitcoin.com News has published many articles about the possible suspects that people have claimed are Satoshi, and the many that claim to be the famous inventor, as well.The first thing we know, however, is that Satoshi Nakamoto left two messages before leaving for good. The first was on December 12, 2010, when the creator left the community a message about “venturing into more complex ideas.” The post on December 12 was Satoshi discussing things in a very serious and direct way, stressing that the “software is not at all resistant to DoS attack.”Nakamoto never returned to discuss anything else on the Bitcointalk.org forum ever again. Years later, emails from Nakamoto to Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen surfaced from April 2011, when Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator said “I’ve moved on to other things.” From here, most everything else about Satoshi’s further communications has been unproven and there have been a lot of wild claims and speculation that still exist to this day.The fact is though, after these messages Satoshi Nakamoto decided not to come back and it’s very possible that the inventor could not return due to health reasons. In fact, some people are quite certain that Hal Finney was the most likely Satoshi Nakamoto candidate. Finney had severe issues with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and passed away in August, 2014. Interestingly, Finney also retired from the PGP Corporation in 2011, the same year Nakamoto sent his final correspondence emails to Hearn and Andresen.Lastly, one of the biggest clues Nakamoto is no longer with us — besides the complete lack of communication after ten years — is the fact that the inventor’s riches remain unspent to this day. It is widely assumed that Nakamoto owns a hoard of 1 million bitcoin (BTC) if the creator is still alive. But the stash of more than $60 billion worth of BTC has never seen the light of day, and there’s a good chance these coins are gone forever if Satoshi Nakamoto is deceased.However, at the end of the day, there are not enough facts that can prove Satoshi is dead, just as there are not enough facts that can prove Satoshi is alive. Zero communications over the years don’t necessarily mean Nakamoto is no longer with us on this earth. Moreover, the fact that Satoshi has never moved or spent the $60 billion worth of bitcoin mined in the early days doesn’t necessarily mean Nakamoto is dead either. One thing is certain, Nakamoto’s shroud of mystery was good enough to make sure we are not.What do you think about the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto is dead? Or do you think Bitcoin’s inventor is alive and well? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

381,"Bitcoin ATMs Double This Year, Exceed 30,000 Globally","Oct 27, 2021","Locations providing crypto ATM services have increased exponentially this year, according to data compiled by a major tracking site. Bitcoin ATMs have doubled in number since January and close to 80 countries now host teller machines exchanging cryptocurrencies with fiat money. In a year when cryptocurrency markets broke all-time highs, the availability of digital coins has increased and bitcoin ATMs have contributed greatly. Their number has recently exceeded 30,000 — more than double the count at the beginning of 2021.Data collected by Coin ATM Radar shows that on Jan. 1, there were 14,016 registered locations supporting automated teller services for leading cryptocurrencies. And, as of Oct. 27, their number has reached a staggering 30,011.These Bitcoin ATMs and other crypto teller services are spread across 76 countries and run by 628 operators, according to the tracking website. The United States is the pronounced leader with more than 26,000 locations while neighboring Canada has a little less than 2,000, and the whole European Union hosts only 1,353.Crypto teller devices have increased in Spain (155) and bitcoin-friendly Switzerland (130) but not all trends have been positive. Their numbers have declined in some other major markets such as Austria, from this year’s high of 156 in June to 140 now, and the U.K. which saw a dramatic fall from 229 on Jan. 1 to 98 as of Wednesday.Supported cryptocurrencies vary between ATMs but most of them provide an opportunity to purchase bitcoin (BTC) and many sell one or more of the other major coins such as bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), and litecoin (LTC). Some offer stablecoins like tether (USDT), or popular altcoins like dogecoin (DOGE). Two-way teller machines, those that can also buy your cryptocurrency, are increasing in number, too.The top 10 operators maintain almost 68% of all crypto ATMs, or more than 20,300. Bitcoin Depot, which has been expanding its network in the U.S., is still the largest among them with 5,314 units (17.7%), while Coincloud is second with 4,028 (13.4%). Coinflip comes in third with 2,953 devices, or a little less than 10% of the world’s total.Genesis Coin remains the leading BATM manufacturer, accounting for over 40% of the market, followed by General Bytes with more than 22%. Bitaccess is a close third with 14% of the currently operational devices. Other producers include Coinsource (6.1%), Bitstop (4.2%), Bytefederal (3.5%), and Lamassu (2.3%). Smaller companies have installed 7.2% of all registered crypto teller machines.Do you think the number of bitcoin ATMs will continue to grow at the current pace in the coming months?

382,Ukraine Security Service Busts Criminal Group Selling Bitcoin-Stealing Malware,"Oct 27, 2021","Law enforcement authorities in Ukraine have exposed a crime ring specializing in cryptocurrency theft and laundering of illicit funds for hackers. The gang, which provided services to clients on the darknet, has been dismantled as a result of a joint operation carried out with the United States. The Cybersecurity Department at the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has recently identified a group of individuals who allegedly laundered tens of millions of dollars from darknet sources, the agency announced. The Ukrainians were legalizing illicit funds on behalf of international hackers, the SBU revealed in a press release published Monday.To launder the money, the suspects organized a large-scale scheme involving fake online identities and fictitious persons. Investigators were able to establish that the funds had been transferred through various financial services. Customers were mostly hackers engaged in cyber theft and attacks on banking systems in different parts of the world.The members of the criminal group were also selling flash drives containing viruses designed to compromise digital wallets and steal cryptocurrency. The operation, carried out with support from U.S. agencies, and with the participation of Ukraine’s national police and the Prosecutor General’s Office, led to searches at addresses in the Southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. Authorities seized computer equipment, malicious software, paperwork, and cash.The SBU explained that the collected information and materials are currently being analyzed to prosecute all responsible persons, including foreign clients of the Ukrainian criminals. The law enforcement authority did not provide details regarding the number of those involved and if they were under arrest.Ukraine, which has in recent years become a leader in crypto adoption while moving to legalize cryptocurrencies, has seen an increase in crypto-related crime. The Security Service of Ukraine has been going after illegal miners this year and shut down crypto farms in different regions of the country. In August, the SBU blocked a number of online crypto exchangers allegedly sending money to Russia.Earlier this month, South Korean police announced participation in a joint operation with Interpol and the FBI to disrupt another Ukraine-based criminal network accused of extorting bitcoin through ransomware attacks on Korean universities and businesses. According to an announcement by the National Office of Investigation, quoted by the Korean public broadcaster KBS, law enforcement raided 21 locations in Kiev this past June, arresting six individuals.The attacks took place in 2019, when four academic institutions and companies in South Korea were blackmailed to pay up to 4.5 billion won (over $3.8 million) worth of bitcoin to have their computer systems decrypted. While Ukraine’s current legislation makes it difficult to extradite the perpetrators, authorities in Seoul have asked Interpol to issue a red notice for two of the suspects who could end up in Korean custody if they leave their country, the report noted.Do you think Ukraine will be able to deal with crypto-related crime?

The software is designed for devices running on Android. The app has been released in response to a growing number of mobile traders. Popular P2P crypto exchange Localbitcoins has presented a mobile application for traders around the world. The app has been developed for Android users and according to an announcement published on Monday, it has already seen thousands of downloads. Work continues to create an iOS version as well, the marketplace assured.The Helsinki, Finland-headquartered company said it’s launching the app after signing up 1.7 million customers in 2020, most of whom were using mobile devices to access its platform. Quoted in the press release, Localbitcoins Chief Marketing Officer Jukka Blomberg commented:Our new mobile app shows our commitment to our global user base and enforces LocalBitcoins’ founding idea of Bringing Bitcoin Everywhere.The application facilitates crypto purchases and sales in 190 countries, the exchange detailed, supporting “almost all global currencies” and more than 100 payment methods. Users are offered a free bitcoin wallet while the security has been enhanced with biometric and two-factor authentication.Localbitcoins also promises low fees, with free deposits and transactions between its users. The platform will collect a 1% escrow fee from advertisers and charge a withdrawal fee based on Bitcoin blockchain fees.“Bringing Bitcoin Everywhere is all about inclusion and accessibility. We are continuously listening to the needs of our customers worldwide and constantly aiming to improve and evolve our service to fulfil those,” Blomberg also stated, adding: “Many of our customers had been hoping for a mobile app as an option and as a result, we developed one.”In the years since its establishment in 2012, Localbitcoins has become the world’s leading peer-to-peer crypto exchange by facilitating over-the-counter trading of bitcoin (BTC) with local fiat currency. In June this year, the platform added to its payment options bitcoin cash (BCH) and dogecoin (DOGE), among other cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins like tether (USDT).Localbitcoins allows users to post advertisements on its website, propose an exchange rate for their digital assets and state the desired payment methods buyers will be able to use to acquire the coins. In 2019, the P2P marketplace announced it was introducing new identity verification rules and removed in-person cash trades, forcing some of its customers to look for alternative services.Paxful, a major competitor of Localbitcoins, has a mobile wallet app which lets users buy, send, and receive BTC, ETH and USDT. Other peer-to-peer crypto exchange options include Hodl Hodl, which last year allowed users of the Bluewallet app to buy bitcoin through an integration with its platform, and Localcryptos, which added support for BCH transactions in September.Are you using a mobile app to exchange cryptocurrencies?

385,Seven-Time Super Bowl Champion Tom Brady Gives a Bitcoin to a Buccaneers Fan,"Oct 26, 2021","Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady announced on ESPN that he was giving a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan a bitcoin for returning the star quarterback’s 600th touchdown pass ball. However, experts have said that if the fan kept the ball it possibly could have sold for $500K. On Monday, legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady explained on ESPN that he was giving a Bucs fan, Byron Kennedy, a single bitcoin for returning his 600th touchdown pass. Brady discussed the idea on his Monday Night Football appearance. According to reports, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan was standing near the end zone after Brady and wide receiver Mike Evans completed the touchdown pass.Evans, however, didn’t realize how important the ball was and tossed it to Byron Kennedy after the touchdown. Experts are saying that if Kennedy kept Brady’s 600th touchdown pass football he could have gotten a lot of money for the keepsake. According to one local report, Kennedy could have sold the ball for upwards of $500K if he waited.Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers decided to negotiate with the Bucs fan and convinced him to return the ball for a reward. The Bucs gave him two signed Tom Brady jerseys, a Brady helmet, a Mike Evans jersey, and cleats. Kennedy also got two season passes to the Bucs 2021 and 2022 seasons and another game ball. The bitcoin gift from Tom Brady was mentioned after the aforementioned rewards were accepted.Brady has been into cryptocurrencies for a decent portion of 2021 and crafted his own non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace called Autograph. In May, Bitcoin.com News reported on Brady adding laser eyes to his social media profile pic in support of BTC reaching $100K per unit. At the end of June, Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen teamed up with the crypto exchange FTX. In September, the two starred in a $20 million ad campaign for FTX.When Brady appeared on Monday Night Football on ESPN and discussed his crypto gift to Kennedy, he said he would make sure that the Bucs fan got his bitcoin. While a single BTC is swapping for just above the $62K region it’s still $438,000 less than what experts think the touchdown ball could sell for on the open market.What do you think about Tom Brady giving a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan a bitcoin in exchange for the touchdown ball? Would you have given the ball back to Brady and the team? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

387,Swarm of Alternative Crypto Assets Outpace Bitcoin's Gains by Double Digits This Week,"Oct 25, 2021","After the price of bitcoin tapped an all-time high above the $67K handle, it then dropped below the $60K zone to $59,510 per unit. Since then, the leading crypto asset has regained some of the losses and bitcoin is still up 2.4% during the last seven days. However, a great number of crypto assets have outperformed bitcoin’s weekly rise, capturing double-digit gains as high as 65.1%.Digital currency markets are on the move again as the $2.733 trillion market valuation of all 10,000+ crypto assets is up 4.6% on Monday. BTC has jumped a bit higher during the latter half of Sunday’s trading sessions into Monday and BTC has gained 2.4% this past week. But there’s over 55 different digital assets that have outperformed BTC’s weekly gains.The top seven-day gainer this week is thorchain (RUNE) which has jumped a whopping 65.1% this past week.

388,"Bitcoin Hashrate Increases 32% in 3 Months, Stealth Miners Command 12% of BTC's Hashpower","Oct 24, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has been increasing a great deal during the last three months, as it’s increased more than 32% from 103 exahash per second (EH/s) on July 25 to today’s 137 EH/s, with a few highs in between around the 189 EH/s mark. Bitcoin’s price spike has pushed the hashrate higher and in a week’s time, the overall mining difficulty is expected to increase for the eighth time in a row.As bitcoin’s price is still more than 30% higher during the last month, even after the fall below the $60K region, the network’s mining power has increased a great deal. Three-month statistics show that Bitcoin’s hashpower has jumped above the 160 EH/s zone nine times since July 25 and over 180 EH/s once so far.At that time three months ago, BTC’s hashrate was steadily recovering from the bitcoin mining crackdown in China and the mass migration that followed. The hashrate and bitcoin’s spot price was much lower three months ago, as the network’s processing power was hovering just above 100 exahash per second.The network’s security and processing power increased 32% since then as the price lift has made it so miners are far more profitable than they were in late July. On October 24, with 137 EH/s dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain, and the current BTC exchange rate, gives most mining rigs the ability to rake in profits.The Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ with 112 terahash per second (TH/s) of hashrate can make $37.47 per day with current BTC prices and $0.12 per kilowatt-hour of electricity per day. Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro with 110 TH/s under the hood gets $37.26 per day at the same electricity rate and Sunday’s BTC exchange rates.Today, the largest mining pool dedicating hashrate to the Bitcoin (BTC) network is F2pool with 17.56% of the network’s hashpower or 26.31 EH/s. F2pool is followed by Antpool’s 17.11% or 25.65 EH/s, Viabtc’s 12% or 17.98 EH/s, and unknown hashrate, otherwise known as stealth miners, command 12% as well or 17.98 EH/s as well.In seven days, the Bitcoin network mining difficulty adjustment is expected as well and it’s estimated to increase by 2.20% from 20.08 trillion to 20.52 trillion. It will be the eight difficulty increase in a row as BTC’s difficulty has increased by 39.94% over the last seven difficulty adjustment algorithm changes.What do you think about Bitcoin’s hashrate increasing and ASIC miners becoming more profitable with the current price spike?

389,From $4 to Over $3.1 Million — Miner Transfers 50 'Sleeping Bitcoin' After BTC Sat Idle for 11 Years,"Oct 24, 2021","On October 22 at 4:52 p.m. (EDT), a miner that acquired 50 bitcoin on May 17, 2010, spent the funds that sat idle for 11 years and five months. There hasn’t been a 2010 block reward spent in three months and the last time a 2010 miner spent their ‘sleeping bitcoin’ was on July 4, 2021. After waiting patiently for more than a decade, the miner who spent the ‘sleeping bitcoin’ on Friday saw a percentage gain of 76,249,900% if the individual cashed out into U.S. dollars today.Editor’s Note: Another block reward from 2010 that was created on July 18, with 50 ‘sleeping bitcoin’ was transferred on October 24, 2021, the day this post was published. The 2010 block reward was transferred at block height 706,461 and at today’s exchange rate it was worth just over $3 million. (Updated at 11:25 a.m. EDT on 10-24-21). It’s been a while since a block reward of 2010 ‘sleeping bitcoins’ have been spent and on Friday, a block reward from that era was transferred after sitting for 11 years and five months. Prior to Friday’s 2010, block reward spend, the last 2010 block transferred was on July 4, 2021.Bitcoin.com News, alongside help from the creator of the blockchain parser btcparser.com, and members of the Telegram channel “Gold Found In Sand,” have been identifying these old school miners from 2010 and other years for quite some time. The block reward spent on Friday came from a mining reward acquired on May 17, 2010, and was transferred at block height 706,203.On September 28, 2021, an in-depth report on ‘sleeping bitcoins,’ showed that old school miners from 2010 through 2013 had moved $1 billion in BTC (using exchange rates from the day the study published) or 23,250 BTC transferred.The 2010 block reward move on Friday, if exchanged for fiat would be worth over $3.1 million, as bitcoin (BTC) opened the day on Friday exchanging hands for $62,237 per unit. Remarkably, when the bitcoin miner acquired the coins, the entire lot was only worth $4. The miner decided to wait and not spend it at $0.08 per unit, which was the price equivalent of a single bitcoin in June-July 2010.The miner would manage to gain a whopping 76,249,900% increase in value if he or she decided to trade the funds for fiat that day. Meanwhile as mentioned above, 2010 block reward spends have been far and few between during the last four months. Although, there’s been a greater number of 2011 block reward transfers.Prior to Friday’s 2010 block, 13 block rewards from 2011 were moved on the blockchain in October alone. Using exchange rates from October 23, that’s $39.5 million in value if exchanged for fiat. This is because the terms “spent” or “spend” in this article do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party like a popular crypto exchange.The 2010 transfer on October 22, did not see the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoinsv (BSV) moved. Those coins remain idle to this day as the stash of BCH is worth $31,312 and the BSV is worth $8,595 at the time of writing. All 2010 block rewards mined in that era will have BCH and BSV tethered to the private keys, alongside the myriad of lesser-known BTC forks.Additionally, the mystery whale that was caught by Bitcoin.com News and help from btcparser.com, has not returned to move strings of bitcoin rewards in over three months. The last time we caught the infamous 2010 mining whale was on June 9, 2021, at block height 686,865.The whale was quite special because it constantly spent 1,000 BTC or 20 block rewards from 2010 in a single block. We cannot say whether or not the whale that constantly spent 20 block rewards from 2010 will not return. Prior to the June 9 spend of 1,000 ‘sleeping bitcoin,’ worth $35 million at the time of transfer, the whale waited 78 days to come back.What do you think about the miner who waited 11 years and five months to spend the 50 bitcoin transferred on Friday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

390,"Bank of Russia Not Ready to Allow Bitcoin ETF Trading, Governor Says","Oct 24, 2021","Central Bank of Russia isn’t prepared to admit a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the market, the head of the regulator, Elvira Nabiullina, told Russian media. Her statement, reaffirming the bank’s hardline stance on cryptocurrencies that has been recently criticized again, came after the debut of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is not ready to permit the trading of ETFs based on bitcoin futures, its chair Elvira Nabiullina said at a press conference this week, quoted by the business news portal RBC. Nabiullina made the comment in response to a question whether the Russian monetary policy regulator is going to follow the example set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and authorize the listing of bitcoin ETFs in the country.The first such investment fund, the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Tuesday, Oct. 19, reaching almost $1 billion in total volume before trading closed. Soon after, wealth manager Vaneck got a green light from the SEC to offer its own bitcoin futures ETF, and on Friday, Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund was listed on Nasdaq.Nabiullina’s statement is in line with CBR’s long-standing conservative position on decentralized digital currencies and crypto-based investment products. In July, the bank advised Russian stock exchanges to avoid the trading of financial instruments tied to crypto assets and their prices. Their listing “entails increased risks of losses for people who do not have sufficient experience and knowledge,” the authority warned.The recommendation issued by the regulator also insisted that asset managers should not include cryptocurrency assets in mutual funds. The CBR further called on brokers and trustees to refrain from offering “pseudo-derivatives with such underlying assets to unqualified investors.” Later reports revealed that Russian lawmakers are considering imposing legal restrictions on the funds private investors may put into crypto.The law on “Digital Financial Assets,” which went into force at the beginning of this year, partially regulates cryptocurrencies, but officials have indicated that additional legislation is needed to ensure comprehensive regulation of the Russian crypto space. The CBR has been opposed to legalizing the circulation of bitcoin and the like, and views cryptos as prohibited money surrogates.The bank’s attitude has recently been criticized by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska who accused the CBR of turning a blind eye to the growing cryptocurrency market, calling its behavior “infantile” in a Telegram post. In July, he remarked that even El Salvador realizes the need to legalize bitcoin. Deripaska also insisted that the Bank of Russia should have launched the digital ruble two years ago, describing the task as more important than Gagarin’s space flight in 1961.Do you think Bank of Russia will change its position on cryptocurrencies and bitcoin ETFs in the future?

392,JPMorgan Sees 'Bullish Outlook' for Bitcoin as Inflation Concerns Push BTC Price Higher,"Oct 23, 2021","Global investment bank JPMorgan says inflation concerns are pushing the price of bitcoin to record highs, rather than interest in recently launched bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Noting that investors are pulling out of gold ETFs into bitcoin funds, the firm noted, “The flow shift remains intact supporting a bullish outlook for bitcoin into year-end.”JPMorgan Chase’s analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, published a research note last week explaining that inflation has been driving up the price of bitcoin to all-time highs rather than the hype around the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, ticker BITO, began trading Tuesday and rapidly amassed $1 billion in investments. The second bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. launched Friday.The JPMorgan analysts believe that “By itself, the launch of BITO is unlikely to trigger a new phase of significantly more fresh capital entering bitcoin,” elaborating:Instead, we believe the perception of bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing, triggering a shift away from gold ETFs into bitcoin funds since September.The analysts added that “The initial hype with BITO could fade after a week.”The price of bitcoin soared to an all-time high of $66,899 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets on Tuesday. At the time of writing, BTC’s price is around $61,249. It has risen approximately 40% since the beginning of the month and more than 90% since the beginning of the year. The price of BTC rose significantly when the market anticipated the approval of a bitcoin futures ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Not only have the JPMorgan analysts explained that the real driver behind the price increase of bitcoin was growing concerns over inflation, but they have also noted that it has pushed investors to seek investments that can act as a hedge against this risk, such as gold and bitcoin.Gold used to be an effective tool to hedge against inflation. However, it has failed in recent weeks to respond to heightened concerns over rising cost pressures. This had driven investors to explore alternative investments, and many have shifted away from gold ETFs into bitcoin funds, the analysts noted, adding:This flow shift remains intact supporting a bullish outlook for bitcoin into year-end.JPMorgan’s analysts are not the only ones viewing bitcoin as a better hedge against inflation than gold. Recently, billionaire fund manager Paul Tudor Jones also said that bitcoin had won the race against gold and he preferred the cryptocurrency to gold as an inflation hedge.What do you think about JPMorgan’s bitcoin view?

The open-source project aims to commodify bitcoin’s hashpower “through smart contracts, making hashpower tradable.”The bitcoin mining operation Titan, a subsidiary of the company Bloq Inc., has announced its decentralized hashpower routing protocol, “Lumerin.” Titan says that bitcoin mining companies “tend to be concentrated in regions that offer cheap electricity, favorable regulation, and stable infrastructure” and it aims to solve centralization via software. The idea is to commodify bitcoin’s processing power and security by leveraging smart contracts.“The Lumerin Protocol will allow companies and individuals to buy, sell, and deliver hashpower, achieving decentralization through open market dynamics,” Titan’s announcement details. “Furthermore, by making hashpower a transferrable digital commodity, the Lumerin Protocol will provide a foundation for hashpower financialization as well as lending, custody, OTC, and trading services.”Titan was co-founded by the company’s CEO Ryan Condron, former Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, and the founding partner of Tally Capital, Matthew Roszak. Condron says that Titan is a significant development in the bitcoin mining space and it aims to partner with industry leaders as well.“The new Lumerin brand and clear solution set definitions will support us in providing leading-edge advances that support the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. Titan is providing significant development effort and time to the Lumerin open source project and is actively looking for strategic partners to join us in developing this technology further,” Condron remarked.While Titan’s other operations will retain the Titan brand, the newly introduced Lumerin open source project will have different software solutions. The announcement details that the project will establish a Lumerin Proxy Node, Lumerin Token, and Lumerin Wallet.“As a result of these changes, we can now move forward with our vision to create a trustless peer-to-peer global marketplace for bitcoin mining and other proof-of-work hashpower products,” Condron said in a statement. “This will allow anyone to harness the power of crypto through bitcoin mining in a decentralized way,” the Titan CEO added.What do you think about Titan aiming to commodify bitcoin’s hashpower via smart contracts?

394,Analyst Suggests Bitcoin's Bottom Could Be $50K Assuming BTC Surpasses $200K This Cycle,"Oct 23, 2021","The price of bitcoin in October has shown signs of a double-bubble similar to the bull run in 2013, and speculators have been trying to guess the leading crypto asset’s top. On October 20, cryptocurrency market analyst Justin Bennett discussed bitcoin’s possible price floor after it reaches the top. Bennett suggests the end of this cycle could be between $207,000 and $270,000. Assuming bitcoin crosses $200K per coin, Bennett thinks the digital asset’s bottom after an 80% pullback will be around $50K.The price of bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high (ATH) at $67,017 on October 20, 2021, and since then the price has shed around 8% in value. On that same day, cryptocurrency market analyst Justin Bennett published some insights about bitcoin’s future in a blog post called “Charting Bitcoin’s Next Five Years.”Cryptocademy’s analyst Bennett discusses BTC’s market fundamentals and he offers a prediction of the end of the cycle as well. In recent times, many bitcoin supporters suspect that a 2013-like double bubble is on the horizon, and the infamous stock-to-flow creator Plan B explained on Saturday that he’s feeling “2013 vibes.”The blog post written by Bennett covers bitcoin bull cycles and talks about where bitcoin (BTC) is going over the next five years. “A look at the 2.272 and 2.414 Fibonacci extensions from the last two cycles shows a target area that was reached both times,” Bennett writes.“If we apply that same area to the current rant, we get an end-of-cycle target for Bitcoin between $207,000 and $270,000,” the analyst adds. Following the end cycle outlook, Bennett details that the last three bear markets that followed the bull cycles have “produced corrections of 94%, 87%, and 84% respectively.”Bennett writes that the previous data also shows that each bear market was less painful than the one prior. The analyst highlights that this data indicates that the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC) is becoming a “maturing market.”As BTC continues to mature, Bennett stresses, bitcoin is “likely to see diminishing returns and bear market corrections.” The Cryptocademy analyst believes this end cycle will be no different. “As such, I’d expect the next bear market to pullback between 75% and 80% from the peak,” Bennett details. The digital currency market analyst’s blog post adds:If we assume bitcoin reaches $200,000+ this cycle and pulls back between 75% and 80% during the next bear market, it would put the next cycle low somewhere around $50,000. And that makes perfect sense. $50,000 is a psychology number, and it’s very near the $65,000 high that lasted for six months recently.Bennett’s prediction follows the recent bitcoin price model crafted by Will Clemente. The lead insights analyst at Blockware Solutions, Will Clemente, tweeted about a new bitcoin price model called the “Illiquid Supply Floor” in mid-September. “Introducing: ‘Illiquid Supply Floor,’” Clemente tweeted on September 15. “This combines Glassnode’s illiquid supply data with Plan B’s traditional S2F model, creating a price floor based on Bitcoin’s real-time scarcity. Currently $39K,” he added at the time.There’s been a number of people attempting to call bitcoin’s price top and some even believe a single “bitcoin will eventually be equivalent to $1 million.” Bennett’s and Clemente’s recent statements touch upon bitcoin’s price bottom and the lowest of lows. Both of these predictions combined indicate that the lowest of lows following this bull cycle’s top could be anywhere between $39K to $50K.What do you think about Justin Bennett’s blog post that suggests bitcoin’s floor will be around $50K per unit? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

395,Journalist and Youtuber Tim Pool Believes 1 Bitcoin Will 'Eventually Be Equivalent to $1 Million',"Oct 22, 2021","The American journalist, Youtuber, podcast host, and political commentator, Tim Pool, has talked about bitcoin on numerous occasions and even more so these days as the crypto asset crossed its all-time price high. After the Proshares exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Pool asked his 897,700 Twitter followers if they thought bitcoin would hit $200K.Tim Pool is a well known person on various social media channels due to the work he’s done as a journalist, show host, and commentator. When it comes to living in these modern times, Pool always has something to say in order to spark meaningful debate. Pool is a former member of Vice Media and in 2014 he also participated in Fusion TV. The activist is also well known for his live-streamed recordings of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011.These days, Pool hosts a Youtube show and podcast called “Timcast IRL” and he discusses things like politics, government, finance, specific people making headlines and a number of other subjects society deals with every day. In Pool’s last Youtube video, he discussed the buckling supply chain that’s been hurting the American and global economy. Pool has a lot of fans because he adheres to being objective when he reports, which is something the public accuses mainstream media of abandoning. Pool is also a fan of the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC) and has mentioned it on several occasions. Last year in October, Pool discussed bitcoin alongside the ‘Great Reset’ subject as well. As bitcoin smashed through its previous all-time price high captured in April, on October 20 Pool said he believes a single BTC could be worth a million dollars. “People still sh** on bitcoin and I feel bad for them,” Pool tweeted. “A local guy out here told me he just became a millionaire off his investment, bought in several years ago and forgot about it.” The popular Youtuber added: It’s the rise of a new financial technology and I believe 1 BTC will eventually be equivalent to $1M. On September 21, Pool’s show featured author Matt Palumbo and the Youtuber discussed cryptocurrencies at great length. The title of the video is called: “Cryptocurrency Is a Positive Force as the Establishment Loses Control, but They’ll Try to Control It.” In the video, Pool talks about how Max Keiser tried to convince him to buy bitcoin in the early days, but at the time he passed. Pool also revealed some of the crypto assets in his portfolio, which include dogecoin (DOGE), bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and cardano (ADA).Prior to that video, Pool discussed the subject in another Timcast IRL video dubbed: “Tim Gets Animated About Bitcoin, Insists It’s Good For Many Things And Allows Greater Freedom.” During the discussion with the co-publisher of Human Events, Will Chamberlain, Pool stressed that BTC is “used to store value outside of the Fed.” In 2018, Pool said that “crypto can save free speech,” and he argued that digital assets can circumvent third parties that partake in financial censorship.What do you think about Tim Pool’s latest statements about bitcoin possibly reaching $1 million per unit?

Coinstar is currently offering bitcoin at more than 8,000 kiosks.Bitcoin can now be purchased at 200 Walmart stores in the U.S., the company reportedly said Thursday.

398,Billionaire VC Peter Thiel Discusses Satoshi’s Identity — Says Bitcoin Is the 'Most Honest Market We Have',"Oct 22, 2021","According to reports, tech billionaire Peter Thiel — the co-founder of Paypal and Palantir — spoke about bitcoin at an event hosted in Miami. At the time, bitcoin had just surpassed its all-time price high and Thiel said “you’re supposed to just buy bitcoin” and added, “I feel like I’ve been underinvested in it.”The tech investor Peter Thiel is a fan of bitcoin (BTC) and has explained this on a few occasions in the past. In mid-May, Palantir Technologies, the American big data software firm, revealed that the company would accept bitcoin for services and was also considering keeping the crypto asset on its balance sheet.Bloomberg reported that the billionaire venture capitalist said bitcoin is an “already known” secret, speaking at a conference in Miami. In addition to this statement, Thiel reportedly said that he felt “underinvested” in bitcoin.Furthermore, Thiel also discussed an early encounter with the founders of E-Gold Ltd., the defunct digital gold company. Thiel talked about a theory he has that he may have met Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, the day he met with the E-Gold team.“My sort of theory on Satoshi’s identity was that Satoshi was on that beach in Anguilla,” Thiel is quoted as saying. “I met them on the beach in Anguilla in February of 2000. We were beginning the revolution against the central banks on the beach in Anguilla. We were going to make Paypal interoperable with E-Gold and blow up all the central banks.”Thiel said there were around 200 people at that initial meeting. “Bitcoin was the answer to E-Gold, and Satoshi learned that you had to be anonymous and you had to not have a company,” Thiel said. “Even a company, even a corporate form was too governmentally linked,” the tech billionaire said.The Information published another set of statements from Thiel that stemmed from a separate event on Monday. The price rise of bitcoin, Theil said, was a clear indicator that the current political system today is fractured.“I don’t know that you should put all your money into bitcoin at $60,000 a bitcoin right now,” Thiel said. “But surely the fact that it is at $60,000 is an extremely hopeful sign. It’s the canary in the coal mine. It’s the most honest market we have in the country, and it’s telling us that this decrepit… regime is just about to blow up,” Thiel added.Thiel has made a few interesting statements about bitcoin in recent times and has alluded to China using bitcoin as a financial weapon against the United States. In 2018, Thiel said that he was “long bitcoin” and that he believed institutional investors would eventually jump into the crypto economy.The Palantir co-founder has also said that bitcoin was a “deeply contrarian” investment. When speaking about Satoshi Nakamoto, Thiel suggested that if people knew who the inventor of Bitcoin was, “the government would arrest him.”What do you think about Peter Thiel’s latest statements about bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto?

399,"Bitcoin ETF May Feel Good to BTC Enthusiasts, but Adoption May Not Advance In-Kind","Oct 22, 2021","While cheered emphatically by the crypto community, the bitcoin ETF’s simplicity hides many drawbacks, especially for long-term investors unfamiliar with the inner workings of the futures market and the rocky results of historical ETF launches.With the first Proshares bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with ticker BITO opening for trading on October 19th, investors with brokerage accounts can finally access the cryptocurrency just like they can any other stock or ETF available.For bitcoin aficionados, the SEC’s announcement catalyzed a positive change in the market, as the price of BTC hit an all-time high above $66,000 amid heightened CME futures and options activity. Likewise, crypto experts believe that with the launch of the bitcoin ETF, bitcoin as an investment option will be more widely accessible and that bitcoin’s recognition will grow.According to Ben Caselin, AAX’s head of research and strategy:Over the long term, the approval will change and elevate the conversation about Bitcoin – both in the mainstream media and among institutional investors. This in turn will likely help to further develop a regulatory framework around digital assets.The crypto community has been urging regulators to approve a bitcoin ETF for years, and many expect its arrival to inspire a new class of investors. While many ordinary investors are afraid to engage with bitcoin due to the complexities of managing wallets and safeguarding private keys, they can now simply log into their brokerage accounts and buy the ETF just like any other stock.Yet, ease of use doesn’t necessarily mean adoption will rise or deliver the steep price gains crypto hodlers anticipate.An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a security that tracks the performance of a particular asset or a group of different assets. In the case of the first US-listed Bitcoin ETF, the ETF will be tied to front-month futures contracts, which are settled in cash at the end of the month and rolled into the following month’s contract. This is different from spot prices, which reflect the current market price for an asset. More importantly, investors in the BITO ETF have no claim to the underlying asset in this case: bitcoin.Moreover, the accompanying ease of use comes at a high price. For one, due to the contango structure of the bitcoin futures market, which reflects higher futures prices relative to spot prices, ETF investors are likely to pay a premium to participate in any bitcoin appreciation.Next, the ETF’s 0.95% management fee, which may not seem like much, seriously impacts long-term investors. For short-term day traders speculating on bitcoin’s rampant volatility, this figure is less relevant. However, this fee eats away at returns over time for long-term investors betting on appreciation, due to the ETF’s need to roll over contracts every month.This fee and contango can result in long-term underperformance relative to holding underlying bitcoin that can reach double-digit rates within years. For example, even though the difference between spot and futures prices was much tighter, the same reality played out in a gold futures ETF with no gold holdings compared to a trust holding physical gold, leading to a double-digit underperformance of 13% over a 5-year horizon.Remarking on the ETF, the CEO of the U.S. subsidiary of Currency.com, Steve Gregory, notes:People will grow more curious and hopefully when they see the futures bitcoin ETF isn’t a good deal for investors, they will explore ways to buy actual bitcoin. Once they go down that route, they will see all the easy-to-use and amazing products crypto exchanges have built. This ETF could serve as the gateway to get more traditional investors into bitcoin.While the bitcoin ETF could very well help move the ball forward in terms of crypto’s wider recognition, its impact on prices is unclear because it moves according to futures market reference rates, not the spot market. For instance, US-based gold trust GLD, which owns the gold to back up each share, has a demonstrable impact on the spot gold market.Futures activity could similarly influence bitcoin prices, especially if the newly introduced ETF sparks a feeding frenzy among institutional investors. Yet, BITO can be shorted, meaning that investors could take either side of the market. Because of the premium of futures prices relative to spot prices, some investors may choose to exploit the arbitrage opportunity by shorting the ETF and buying actual bitcoin. This could put downward pressure on ETF prices but potentially have a positive impact on the spot market.Although too early to state with certainty how one market for bitcoin will impact the other, the first day of the BITO bitcoin ETF was positive, marking one of the most successful ETF launches in history after reaching nearly $1 billion in trading volume.While the newly greenlit bitcoin ETF is great news for the Bitcoin community, it only benefits a cryptocurrency that already commands the largest market share. Other promising cryptocurrencies like ethereum, cardano, and other altcoins are nowhere near getting their own ETFs, at least for now, namely due to the absence of regulatory clarity on their categorization.Kucoin CEO Johnny Lyu adds:We think more cryptocurrency ETFs will be launched in the future as crypto-related investment products get growing interest from more traditional investors to hedge against an economic downturn. However, it took years for the SEC to approve the launch of BTC Futures ETFs, and we might not be able to anticipate another crypto ETF coming to the market in the short term until the financial regulatory bodies have more control on the stable outcome of the current experiment.Only time will tell if bitcoin ETFs will act as a primary catalyst for the growth of bitcoin only, or play a critical role in accelerating mass adoption of cryptocurrencies in general.What do you think of the bitcoin ETF rollout?

402,US Public Pension Fund for Firefighters Adds Bitcoin and Ether Worth $25 Million to Portfolio,"Oct 21, 2021","The $5.5 billion pension fund for the U.S. city of Houston’s firefighters has announced an investment in bitcoin and ether. “This investment marks the first announced investment in digital assets by a public pension plan in the U.S.”The Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF), the pension fund for the city of Houston’s firefighters, announced Thursday that it had purchased bitcoin and ether for the defined benefit plan’s portfolio. The announcement describes:This investment marks the first announced investment in digital assets by a public pension plan in the U.S.According to Bloomberg, the Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund has $5.5 billion in assets and it invested $25 million in bitcoin and ether. The investment was facilitated by the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), a bitcoin investment arm of Stone Ridge Asset Management.The HFRRF pension fund handles retirement benefits for more than 6,600 active and retired firefighters and survivors of firefighters. Active firefighters have contributed 9% of their salary to the fund since 2004, with the city of Houston contributing at least twice that amount.“We are excited to take this first step forward into the world of digital assets,” commented Ajit Singh, HFRRF’s chief investment officer. He elaborated:We have been studying digital assets’ transformative potential for some time … It became an asset class we could not ignore anymore.He continued: “This investment expresses our belief in the disruptive potential of distributed ledger technology for the development and democratization of value accumulation through disintermediation.”Singh was also quoted by Bloomberg as saying: “I see this as another tool to manage my risk … It has a positive expected return and it manages my risk. It has a low correlation to every other asset class.”The HFRRF chief investment officer preferred to invest in coins directly, rather than taking on risk associated with futures-related investments. He explained: “We didn’t want to get the synthetic exposure. We decided to go directly to the token. As more and more institutional adoptions happen, there will be more and more dynamics that develop for supply and demand. And having physical assets — actual tokens — gives us in the future the possibility of income generation potential.”Nate Conrad, global head of asset management at NYDIG, opined:This investment represents a watershed moment for bitcoin and its place in public pensions. Fiduciaries are increasingly aware of how even a small allocation to digital assets can make a big impact over time.Do you think more public pension funds will buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

403,Sources Say Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF Set to Launch on Nasdaq This Week,"Oct 21, 2021","After the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed and smashed records in the first two days of trading, Vaneck’s bitcoin futures ETF was given the green light to start trading next week. Furthermore, sources say that the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF is set to launch this week with a possible listing on Friday. October is the month of bitcoin exchange-traded funds as the United States approved the first ETF last week. Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE: BITO) listed on Tuesday and saw close to $1 billion in volume on its first day of trading.The following day, BITO continued to perform remarkably and bitcoin (BTC) spot markets tapped a new lifetime price high at $67,017 per unit.If $BITO keeps up this pace of inflows it wont have any futures left to buy by the end of the month due to pos limits (via rough back of envelope calc w/ @JSeyff ). https://t.co/KauFuaPzhb— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 21, 2021In fact, the senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, Eric Balchunas, explained how the bitcoin ETF was one of the fastest in history to capture $1 billion in assets. Balchunas said:RECORD BREAKER: BITO assets up to $1.1b after today, making it the fastest ETF to get to $1b (2 days) breaking [gold’s] 18 [year] old record (3 days), which is poetically apropos.Balchunas is one source that has said that the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF is set to launch this week. In addition to statements from Balchunas, crypto reporter Danny Nelson confirmed with a Valkyrie spokesperson that the fund will begin trading on Friday after it “cleared the final regulatory hurdles.” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst also explained the news on Twitter.“Just got word Valkyrie is changing the ticker back to BTF 🙁 SEC prob wasn’t a fan of BTFD. Also odds [are] growing they will launch tomorrow. Not final yet [though],” Balchunas said.Then he corrected his tweet and noted that the Valkyrie ETF would list on Friday. “I had said this was launching [tomorrow] it’s actually going to be on Friday. Sorry about that,” the analyst further detailed.The Valkyrie fund will leverage the ticker symbol “BTF” but there was talk about the company adopting the ticker “BTFD.” Unlike Proshares and Vaneck, the Valkyrie ETF will list on Nasdaq rather than the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Valkyrie’s ETF was originally filed in August and the operating expenses per year are 0.95%, according to the pre-effective amendment filed Wednesday morning.What do you think about the possibility of Valkyrie’s ETF launching this Friday?

404,Vaneck Bitcoin Futures ETF Gets Green Light from SEC — Fund to Join Proshares BTC ETF Listing on NYSE,"Oct 20, 2021","The wealth manager Vaneck will be launching its bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States following the Proshares ETF listing that launched on Tuesday. According to the post-effective filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Vaneck bitcoin futures ETF launch is approved to be listed after October 23.This week, the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (BITO) launched with a lot of fanfare and the ETFs volume broke records on Tuesday. The following day, bitcoin (BTC) spot markets smashed an all-time price (ATH) at $67,017 per unit. Additionally, the wealth manager Vaneck published its bitcoin futures ETF post-effective filing on Wednesday which indicates that the SEC has green-lighted the listing on NYSE Arca.The Vaneck Bitcoin Strategy ETF’s ticker will be “XBTF” and the fund leverages cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts. The Vaneck ETF summary details that the fund “does not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly.” After the post-effective filing was published, Nate Geraci, the co-founder of The ETF Institute tweeted about the approval. “Vaneck [is] joining the bitcoin futures ETF party next week,” Geraci said.The Vaneck approval follows the phenomenal market performance Proshares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (BITO) saw on Tuesday. Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg explained on Wednesday that BITO is already “in the top 30% of ETFs by assets and a near-lock to exceed my $750m by end-of-week estimate.”Vaneck decided to apply for the Bitcoin Strategy ETF on August 10, following SEC chairman Gary Gensler’s statements that week. At that time, Gensler said he looks forward to regulators reviewing ETFs that are particularly associated with bitcoin futures, he mentioned the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 as possibly being sufficient enough for regulation.Gary Gensler also spoke about the approval of the Proshares bitcoin ETF during an interview with CNBC Tuesday and he said: “Bitcoin futures have been overseen by our sibling agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC], which I was once honored and proud to serve there and that’s been four years.”The Proshares and Vaneck bitcoin futures ETF approvals mark a milestone for bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds in the United States. For the first time, U.S. investors can participate in an ETF that has some ties to the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC).The U.S., however, is not the first North American ETFs to be approved as Canada has approved a few bitcoin-related ETFs during the last 12 months. While October 23 is a Saturday, the community expects the Vaneck bitcoin futures ETF to list the following Monday on October 25.What do you think about Vaneck getting approval to list its bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S.?

405,Analyst That Said $200-300K Bitcoin 'Looks Programmed' Still Says BTC Price 'Nowhere Near a Top',"Oct 20, 2021","On Wednesday, just before bitcoin surpassed the digital asset’s all-time high (ATH), the crypto analyst known as “Techdev” says the “2-week chart looks strong and ready for much higher highs.” Just 26 days ago, Techdev said that “$200-300K bitcoin looks almost too programmed” and this week, the analyst noted that we are “nowhere near a top.”The leading digital currency bitcoin (BTC) has been on a tear during the last few weeks as it has continuously gained value week over week. It’s safe to say that September wasn’t the greatest month for BTC, and October was a complete reversal.Throughout bitcoin’s lifetime, traditionally the last three months of the year are notable times when BTC sees significant gains. 23 hours ago, on October 19, the notorious bitcoin analyst Plan B tweeted a checkmark after BTC tapped $63K on Tuesday, because of the prediction he made on June 20.At that time, Plan B said his “worst case scenario” BTC price prediction for 2021 (price/on-chain based)” would be: “Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K.”His correct forecast and checkmark tweet highlighting the $63K goal has been retweeted close to 5,000 times and the tweet has more than 30,000 likes today. Another crypto market analyst, dubbed Techdev, has been very bullish as well, telling his 88,700 Twitter followers what he expects for bitcoin’s future prices.26 days ago on September 24, Techdev tweeted “$200-300K bitcoin looks almost too programmed” as he shared a chart of Fibonacci stats. On October 20, as bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold above the $64K handle, Techdev is still very optimistic.“[Bitcoin] 2-week chart looks strong and ready for much higher highs,” the analyst tweeted on Wednesday. “Expect RSI to peak around 93-94. Stoch RSI should be maxed and flat at that time as well. Both halfway there from July low and the $ increase per indicator value should accelerate from here. Nowhere near a top,” Techdev added.Techdev shared a tweet from another bitcoin proponent called “Crypto Caesar” who is also very bullish. The tweet stemmed from commentary Crypto Caesar made in the summer months when BTC’s price was much lower.“Nothing has changed on my previous opinion,” Crypto Caesar said about a week before Plan B’s ‘worst case scenario’ forecast this past summer. “I firmly believe we are still in a bull market. 64k was NOT the top (not even halfway!). Patience. HODL.”Anyone with access to a logarithmic BTC/USD chart that extends from the beginning of bitcoin’s first price point until today can clearly see the possibility of a “double-top” or “double-bubble” scenario. The 2017 bitcoin bull run did not have much of a double bubble run up and it was mostly a single-run parabolic jump toward $20K.However, in 2013, bitcoin (BTC) clearly had a double bubble, jumping over $200 per coin in mid-April 2013 and then diving to $70 per unit. After that dip in the spring, BTC surprised everyone when it reached a high of $1,250 per unit in December 2013.What do you think about Plan B’s correct prediction and Techdev’s current forecast that bitcoin is nowhere near a top?

408,Gary Gensler Explains Why SEC Approves a Bitcoin Futures ETF,"Oct 19, 2021","SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has shared why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to approve a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) to trade on the NYSE. Meanwhile, the Commission has not approved a spot bitcoin ETF.As the first futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. debuted on the NYSE, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) explained why the regulator greenlighted a bitcoin futures ETF but not a spot bitcoin ETF.In an interview with CNBC Tuesday, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated that his agency “should be technology neutral, but not policy neutral.” He elaborated:What we’re trying to do is ensure to the best we can within our authorities to bring projects into the investor protection perimeter.“Bitcoin futures have been overseen by our sibling agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC], which I was once honored and proud to serve there and that’s been four years,” the SEC chief continued.He added that one of the applications “went effective with regard to those products over at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange [CME] that our sibling agency oversees.”Responding to a question about why the SEC has approved a bitcoin futures ETF but not a spot bitcoin ETF, Gensler noted that he will not comment on any specific application or project. However, the SEC chief clarified:What you have here is a product that’s been overseen for four years by a U.S. federal regulator, the CFTC, and that’s being wrapped inside of something that’s within our jurisdiction called the Investment Company Act of 1940. So, we have some ability to bring it inside of investor protection.While emphasizing that bitcoin is “still a highly speculative asset class and listeners should understand that underneath this, it still has that same aspect of volatility and speculation,” the SEC chairman concluded: “Our sister agency is overseeing this for four years and then it brings it inside an 80-year-old law here at the SEC.”The Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, ticker “BITO,” began trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). “The fund seeks to provide capital appreciation primarily through managed exposure to bitcoin futures contracts,” its website details, adding that it “does not invest directly in bitcoin.”What do you think about the SEC approving the first bitcoin-based ETF and Gensler’s comments?

409,Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF Debut Captures Close to $1 Billion in Volume,"Oct 19, 2021","The first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in the United States and smashed records on Tuesday, capturing close to $1 billion in total volume. Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg said that the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) definitely “defied expectations.”Proshares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (BITO) did well on its first day, as it closed the day at 4:00 p.m. (EDT) at $41.94 per unit. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin (BTC) soared on Tuesday, tapping a high of $64,367 on the crypto exchange Bitstamp fifteen minutes after the closing bell on Wall Street.As the ETF shares swapped hands on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), BITO reached a daily high of over $42. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart tweeted at the end of the day: “Looks like the final tally is gonna be right around ~$990 million in trading for BITO on its first day trading.”Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, also tweeted about the action the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF saw on Tuesday. “BITO just about $1 [billion] in total volume today (curr $993m but trades still trickling in),” Balchunas said. “Easily the biggest Day One of any ETF in terms of ‘natural’ volume. It also traded more than 99.5% of all ETFs ([including] some big [ones] like DIA, ARKK, SLV). It [definitely] defied our expectations.” The analyst added:If we don’t exclude ETFs where their Day One volume was literally one pre-planned giant investor or BYOA (not natural), it still ranks #2 overall. Here’s that list. The reason some of these shouldn’t be included IMO is they don’t really represent grassroots interest.While the Proshares bitcoin ETF had a decent day, bitcoin (BTC) spot markets also rampaged on October 19. BTC’s market cap swelled over $1.2 trillion on Tuesday and there’s been $42.4 billion in global trade volume throughout the day.Balchunas stressed that the result of today’s first bitcoin ETF performance in the U.S., “makes life that much harder for the next in line ETFs to succeed.” He added: “Every day counts [because] once an ETF gets [known] as ‘the one’ and has tons of [liquidity], it’s virtually imposs to steal (see SPY, GLD).” Balchunas concluded:What does this mean for assets? My guess is about half of this volume will end up as flows next two days. [Probably] looking at $750 [million] by end of week, something like that. Tomorrow’s volume will be interesting and how much it comes down to Earth vs [staying] high.What do you think about the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) performance on Tuesday?

411,Fraud-Accused South African Bitcoin Trader to Turn Himself Over to Police: Report,"Oct 19, 2021","Sandile Shezi, the young South African bitcoin trader who is facing fraud charges, has denied allegations he scammed shareholders in his Global Forex Institute. Despite his rejection of the allegations, a spokesperson for the country’s police told the Sunday Times newspaper that Shezi has agreed to turn himself in. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, a warrant for Shezi’s arrest had been issued after two aggrieved investors reported the bitcoin trader to the South African police.Now, as he contemplates turning himself in, Shezi — who is referred to as South Africa’s youngest millionaire — has also launched a spirited defense of his actions. He further beat back suggestions that the Global Forex Institute is a financial services provider. According to a report by the Sunday Times, Shezi said:These shareholders signed up, not for investments, but our education programme. Our training includes technical analysis, fundamentals and a bit of this and that. You go through us to run your own small personal portfolio, not trade for HSBC.The 29-year-old bitcoin trader added that he finds it strange that some shareholders are making these allegations when in fact they were part and parcel of the business. Nevertheless, Shezi said he is now exploring the possibility of buying out the shareholders.In the meantime, Shezi’s lawyers have vowed in a statement released via Instagram on October 15, that they will launch legal proceedings against those accusing Shezi of defrauding them.What are your thoughts about this story?

412,FinCEN Links More Than $5 Billion in Bitcoin Transactions to Ransomware,"Oct 19, 2021","FinCEN, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, linked more than $5 billion in bitcoin transactions to the most common ransomware variants out there. The organization stated in a report issued last week that the mean average total monthly suspicious amount of ransomware transactions was $66.4 million during the first two quarters of 2021. FinCEN also determined that the most used cryptocurrency associated with these activities was bitcoin.FinCEN, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, found that more than $5 billion in bitcoin transactions were linked to payments made to the top-ten most popular ransomware variants. These findings were published by the institution in a report titled “Ransomware Trends in Bank Secrecy Act Data Between January 2021 and June 2021,” which summarizes the ransomware activity during the first two quarters of the year.The report, which examines ransomware trends and their critical effect on infrastructure, states that 635 reports and 458 transactions were reported as of June. This number goes over the whole amount of incidents that were reported during 2021. Some of the most known incidents include the Colonial Pipeline attack, which caused shortages of gas all across the country.The report also found that bitcoin was the most used cryptocurrency for ransomware-related transactions. In the examined period, FinCEN reported that the vast majority of payments associated with these incidents were requested to be made in bitcoin. However, there was a marginal increase in payments made with monero, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.Another interesting finding of the report is that most of the funds collected through these activities were directed to known entities such as exchanges and that techniques such as “Chain Hopping”, which involves changing one cryptocurrency into another, were being used to avoid detection by the authorities. The use of mixers is also an increasingly common occurrence, seeking to further obfuscate the paths of the mixed cryptocurrencies.Defi applications could also serve to convert some of these currencies to others in order to exchange them freely on other, more liquid exchanges. FinCEN identified ransomware-related funds that were sent indirectly to addresses associated with open protocols for use on defi applications.The institution advised organizations to be quick to file a suspicious activity report when a ransomware attack happens and to integrate intrusion detection systems in their cyber defense mechanisms.What do you think about FinCEN’s latest ransomware report and its link to cryptocurrencies?

413,"Microstrategy CEO Advises Nigeria and Zimbabwe to Adopt Bitcoin Standard, Says BTC Is 'Kingmaker'","Oct 19, 2021","Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor has suggested Nigeria and Zimbabwe issue currencies that are backed by bitcoin if they want to fix their economies. He surmised that using the bitcoin standard will end starvation and allow citizens of both countries to have a decent life.In a video clip where he also addresses claims that the Bitcoin network cannot scale, Saylor suggests that if Nigeria and Zimbabwe purchase bitcoins worth $2-3 billion, they could well end the currency woes they presently face. Saylor explained:You wanna fix your country like Nigeria, or Zimbabwe? The way you fix your country is you buy $2 billion, $3 billion worth of bitcoin and you issue currency backed by the bitcoin. That is the bitcoin standard. And every one of your citizens stops starving to death. And they live a decent life.Before mentioning Nigeria and Zimbabwe, Saylor, whose company now holds more than 114,000 bitcoins, also identifies Turkey as another country that could buy bitcoins and use them to back the lira currency. According to Saylor, if Turkey were to purchase bitcoins worth $5 billion and hold these for the next five years, this could potentially strengthen the lira currency.Despite Saylor’s constant exhortations, only one country, El Salvador, appears to have taken heed of the advice. Many other countries, including Nigeria, have instead chosen to create their own digital currencies which they hope will diminish the appeal of bitcoin.However, in the same video, Saylor insists this will happen and this will prove that bitcoin is “the kingmaker.”Do you agree with Saylor’s sentiments on bitcoin?

415,"A Slew of Defi Tokens Outperform Bitcoin's Weekly Gains, Defi TVL and NFT Sales Spike","Oct 18, 2021","October has been a strong month for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin but a number of decentralized finance (defi) tokens have seen higher double-digit gains this past week. Moreover, non-fungible token (NFT) sales have picked up and after the total-value locked (TVL) in defi crossed $200 billion on October 5, two weeks later another $22 billion has been added to the TVL. Bitcoin (BTC) has been doing extremely well and BTC dominance has increased to 45.3% during the last week. However, a decent quantity of defi tokens from specific blockchain networks have outperformed BTC during the last week.In fact, out of all the crypto assets in existence today, nine different digital assets saw better gains than bitcoin and a great deal of them are focused on defi. Polkadot (DOT) was this week’s leader with an increase of 19.6% and those gains were followed by polygon’s (MATIC) 19.4% percentage gains. Other strong gainers that outperformed bitcoin included binance coin (BNB), stacks (STX), and stellar (XLM).Two weeks ago, on October 5, the total-value locked (TVL) in defi surpassed $200 billion and today defillama.com stats indicate the TVL is $222 billion. The decentralized exchange (dex) platform Curve holds the largest dominance with 7.72% of the TVL in defi. Curve is followed by Aave, Makerdao, and Wrapped Bitcoin in terms of defi dominance on October 18.Ethereum captures $152.27 billion of the total TVL in defi and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) commands $19.22 billion. Blockchains that have seen significant increases in TVL in defi include networks like Solana, Terra, and Avalanche. While Avalanche saw a 31.24% TVL gain, Harmony’s TVL increased by 24% during the last week.Metrics from nonfungible.com’s 30-day market history indicates that NFT sales jumped a great deal on October 5, and have continued to rise. NFT sales recorded during the last month were around $1.836 billion across 174,529 active market wallets.Statistics from Dune Analytics show that the total transaction volume for NFTs measured in ETH, across 5.9 million transactions, is around 3,886,298 ether or $11.1 billion using today’s exchange rates.Moreover, dappradar.com data shows that the NFT marketplace Opensea is nearing $10 billion in all-time sales and currently has $9.19 billion recorded so far. Axie Infinity has $2.61 billion and the NFT marketplace Rarible has recorded $230.76 million in all-time sales.Additionally, statistics recorded by Coin98 Analytics weekly defi report indicates that the number of BSC active addresses reached an all-time high. However, the Polygon (MATIC) network surpassed BSC as far as the quantity of wallets created onchain.“It also reached the ATH of 100 million wallets,” Coin98 Analytics said in its report. “The number of Ethereum wallets has remained unchanged from last week.”The weekly report also discusses defi’s liquidity by protocol, dex platform weekly trading volume, and the daily active dex users as well. The report highlights that while dex trade volume has not grown much, it maintained $20 to $22 billion each month. Coin98 Analytics detailed, however, that Sushiswap volume “increased sharply, reaching $2.7 billion.”What do you think about the defi tokens outperforming bitcoin and the TVL increase during the last two weeks? What do you think about the NFT sales volumes increasing and the address increase on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain? Let us know what you think about these subjects in the comments section below.

416,Local Businesses in New York Urge Governor to Impose Statewide Bitcoin Mining Moratorium,"Oct 18, 2021","The governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has been urged by a group of local companies to deny business permits to bitcoin miners. The letter specifically asks for the “denial of permits for the Greenidge Generating Station and the Fortistar North Tonawanda Facility.” The letter also calls for the New York government to assess “proof-of-work” (PoW) digital currency mining in the state as the local businesses believe PoW mining “drastically undermines New York’s climate goals.”Climate change is a big deal to a number of local businesses in the state of New York as a large coalition of companies has urged governor Kathy Hochul to deny bitcoin mining permits. The coalition’s letter is backed by businesses and organizations such as Seatuck Environmental Association, Ravines Wine Cellars, Peconic Baykeeper, Nassau Hiking & Outdoor Club, NYPAN Environmental Committee, Mothers Out Front New York, and New Yorkers for Clean Power.“We, the undersigned organizations, businesses, and labor groups, write today to urge your administration to issue a statewide moratorium on proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mining until a thorough statewide Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) is conducted, and to deny the permits for the Greenidge Generating Station and the Fortistar North Tonawanda Facility,” the letter states. The letter, published to earthjustice.org on October 13, adds:“These ‘mining’ activities, particularly proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining use enormous amounts of energy to power the computers needed to conduct business – should this activity expand in New York, it could drastically undermine New York’s climate goals established under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.”The state of New York (NY) is no stranger to such controversies over bitcoin mining as debate over the subject has raged on for a few years now. In 2018, a number of counties in NY, like the Plattsburgh Common Council, passed new guidelines for miners that aimed to control noise and fire safety regulations. Despite the stricter rules in specific areas, bitcoin miners have been flocking to NY over the last two years. Meanwhile, as miners entered the New York market, operations started getting complaints from local neighbors and NY politicians.In December 2020, an environmental organization called Sierra Club, a committee aimed at preserving the Finger Lakes region, filed a lawsuit against the NY town of Torrey for allowing the Greenidge Generation power plant to expand its mining operations. Sierra Club asked the town of Torrey and the Torrey Planning Board to block the construction with an injunction. Senator Kevin Parker (D) believes bitcoin miners should halt operations over climate change concerns as well.In May 2021, senator Parker introduced legislation to address these concerns as he explained that bitcoin mining “threatens not only New York’s climate goals, under the CLCPA, but also global energy policy, such as the Paris Agreement.”Parker’s bill aimed to impose a moratorium on the operation of cryptocurrency mining centers until the NY government could complete an assessment of the environmental impact. If the moratorium was imposed, bitcoin mining operations that could prove the business does not “adversely affect the state greenhouse gas emission targets in the climate leadership and community protection act of 2019,” could operate legally under NY law.The recent letter to NY governor Kathy Hochul says that bitcoin mining facilities are threatening the state’s advances toward addressing climate change.“In New York, data mining operations using warehouses full of computers have set up shop in upstate areas siphoning electricity from New York’s grid, ‘re-powering’ defunct fossil-fueled power plants, thus seriously jeopardizing the state’s progress on and meeting mandates for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,” the letter emphasizes.The letter stresses that the group of local businesses want governor Hochul to act now. The letter concludes:“As you have witnessed in your early weeks on the job, the climate crisis in New York is here now. New York City recently saw unprecedented flooding that led to the loss of lives – strong climate action is needed now more than ever. We urge you to lead the way and set a national precedent on the issue of proof-of-work cryptocurrency by issuing a statewide moratorium and denying the permits for Greenidge and Fortistar. Thank you for your time and consideration of our comments.”What do you think about the letter to NY governor Kathy Hochul that wants a statewide moratorium placed on bitcoin mining operations in New York?

417,As Bitcoin's Price Spikes Pods of BTC Whales Begin to Shrink in Size,"Oct 18, 2021","Recent metrics from a variety of analytical web portals show that the quantity of bitcoin whales has been shrinking in recent times. The data indicates that the leading crypto asset has been distributed quite a bit since the price run-up started. Today, data shows that bitcoin whales are shrinking and metrics from bitinfocharts.com’s top 100 richest bitcoin addresses list compared to a whale count article Bitcoin.com News published on May 14, show things have changed. Statistics from Glassnode show that whale-sized addresses with 1,000 BTC+ have dipped to the smallest amount in eight years and ten months ago.In addition to those two sites that offer onchain whale analytics, whalemap.io also implies a decline in whales (balance ≥ 1k) and a downward distribution cycle. Also, the top 100 richest bitcoin addresses from bitinfocharts.com indicate that on May 13, 2021, there were three whales with 100,000 to 1 million BTC.There are still just three today, and that number hasn’t changed in quite some time. In terms of addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 bitcoin, that has reduced since May 13, from 85 to 77 addresses. As far as holders with 1,000 to 10,000 bitcoin, there were approximately 2,078 addresses five months ago and today the count is 2,069.Additionally, addresses with 100 to 1,000 BTC were around 13,989 five months ago and today are 13,987. The bottom threshold of addresses holding 10 to 100 BTC or less has increased a great deal during the last five months.In recent weeks, all the BTC addresses with less than 1,000 held have swelled. 51.24% of addresses recorded own between 0 to 0.001 BTC, which is 19,716,447 bitcoin addresses. Addresses that hold 0.1 to 1 BTC today equal around 2,437,951 bitcoin addresses and there are 665,893 holders with at least 1 to 10 BTC.February – May $BTC whales (>1k BTC) were gradually selling to retail investors (>.1 BTC). This is why the distribution phase displayed on the HT chart. They kept the price stable via manipulation until they were finished selling – then collapse. The whales won, again. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ia8C8ze99h— Illusive ⛓ (@IllusiveTrades) October 10, 2021It’s quite possible that while bitcoin (BTC) rose over 25% during the last 30 days, a number of bitcoin whales took some cream off the top by selling. It’s also probable that whales have simply dispersed their bitcoin wealth into more addresses.The last time BTC whale addresses were this low was the holiday season in 2012 and that followed bitcoin’s first bull run. In the summer of 2012 and into the fall months, BTC tapped a high of $30 per unit, but in December 2012, it was just over $2 per coin. Whale count saw a major downward distribution cycle at that time as well. A whale with 1,000 bitcoin on Sunday evening is worth roughly $62 million.What do you think about the whale count shrinking? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

419,"'Big Short' Investor Michael Burry Not Shorting Bitcoin, Warns 'Cryptocurrencies Are in a Bubble'","Oct 17, 2021","Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, famed for forecasting the 2008 financial crisis, has confirmed that he has not been shorting cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, despite speculations that he may have. His confirmation came after he recently asked how to short crypto.Famous investor and founder of private investment firm Scion Asset Management, Michael Burry, confirmed to CNBC Friday that he has not been shorting bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.Burry is best known for being the first investor to foresee and profit from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010. He is profiled in “The Big Short,” a book by Michael Lewis about the mortgage crisis, which was made into a movie starring Christian Bale.He told CNBC Friday:I’ve not been shorting cryptocurrencies at all. And I’m not now … I believe that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble and that most in it do not understand it well.Many people in the crypto community believed that Burry shorted bitcoin when the price of the cryptocurrency was $30K after he posted a BTC price chart suggesting that it would be a good time to short. Burry never confirmed or denied whether he shorted bitcoin until now.The crypto community became even more convinced that Burry was shorting bitcoin or was considering doing so when he tweeted Wednesday:Ok, I haven’t done this before, how do you short a cryptocurrency? Do you have to secure a borrow? Is there a short rebate? Can the position be squeezed and called in? In such volatile situations, I tend to think it’s best not to short, but I’m thinking out loud here.When Burry tweeted asking about shorting cryptocurrencies Wednesday, the price of bitcoin was around $58K. It then shot up past $62K. At the time of writing, the price of BTC is $61,011 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Comments flooded Twitter in response to his tweet about shorting cryptocurrencies with many people mocking his knowledge of crypto. Burry deleted the tweet about five minutes after posting it. While the Big Short investor routinely deleted his tweets, it was not usually minutes after posting them. He then deleted his entire Twitter account Friday, causing some people to suspect that he quit Twitter because of the responses he got from his crypto tweet.Trader Scott Melker, aka “The Wolf of All Streets,” commented: “Let me get this right. Michael Burry of ‘Big Short’ fame asked how to short bitcoin, was destroyed by crypto Twitter and then rage quit Twitter entirely because he couldn’t deal with the responses?”Burry also recently criticized the shiba inu (SHIB) token after the price of the coin soared 230%.What do you think about Michael Burry’s comments?

He further revealed that he is waiting for the next pullback before investing more in bitcoin.Famous author and investor Robert Kiyosaki said last week that bitcoin’s future is “very bright.” Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.Kiyosaki tweeted Friday:Hooray. Bitcoin rising above $60,000. Future very bright. Celebrate yet be cautious. I am waiting for a pullback before investing more.While the famous investor has been recommending bitcoin to investors for quite some time, he predicted that a “giant stock market crash” was coming in October, adding that gold, silver, and bitcoin may crash as well. In July, he warned: “Biggest bubble in world history getting bigger. Biggest crash in the world history coming.”Nonetheless, he saw bitcoin as the investment with the greatest upside, noting that “With dollar dropping, bitcoin and silver are the best investments.” In August, he tweeted that America was “going bankrupt,” recommending investors to “Keep buying gold, silver, bitcoin.”At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is $62,362 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Moreover, Kiyosaki reiterated Friday his reason for investing in bitcoin, tweeting:I love bitcoin because I do not trust the Fed, Treasury, or Wall Street.His statement echoed the comment he made in August, stating that the primary reason he invested in bitcoin, gold, and silver was “because I do not trust our leaders, the Fed, Treasury, nor the stock market.”What do you think about Robert Kiyosaki’s comments?

421,Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele Taunts Economist Steve Hanke After Bitcoin's Price Skyrockets,"Oct 17, 2021","On October 15, the day bitcoin’s price surpassed the $60K per unit handle, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele taunted the professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke, over his recent statements. At the time, the well known economist warned that El Salvador faces “financial ruin” with “Bukele at the helm,” after El Salvador’s president bought the bitcoin dip when the price was down.When El Salvador adopted bitcoin (BTC) during the first week of September, the first day the law was enacted, BTC’s fiat value dropped a great deal. At that time, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele told his Twitter followers that El Salvador was “buying the dip” as the country added 150 BTC to its stash. Meanwhile, the professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke, has criticized the Salvadoran president and tagged him in a Twitter post on September 23.“Nayib Bukele is playing fast and [loose] with El Salvador’s tax dollars again,” Hanke said. “After bitcoin prices tumbled to a 6wk low, Bukele bought 150 more coins [and] proudly said that ‘We just bought the dip.’ With Bukele at the helm, ELSL faces financial ruin.”Meanwhile, the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC) did fall into a slump in September, but as the month transitioned into October, BTC’s price skyrocketed. On October 15, Bukele decided to retweet Hanke’s September 23 statement and added a remark of his own. “You were saying?” Bukele tauntingly asked the well known economist. BTC has since been hovering above the $60K price range during the last 24 hours.The following day, Hanke responded and said: “Yes, I was saying ‘financial ruin.’ Have you checked the price plunge of El Salvador’s dollar-denominated bonds since September 7th?” Hanke asked Bukele. “As the traders say, El Salvador’s bonds due in 2023, 2025, & 2029 are ‘distressed,’” Hanke added.Furthermore, the founder of Shapeshift, Erik Voorhees, also responded to Hanke’s tweet on Saturday with an animated GIF that shows goalposts moving. Another individual stated: “Hanke sounds like [the] people who were afraid of electricity in the 19th century.” Hanke has clearly stated that he’s not fond of bitcoin (BTC) many times, and he’s warned about El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption in June.At that time, Hanke said he didn’t think it’s a good idea for the Latin American country to use bitcoin as legal tender and he further added that the decision could “completely collapse the economy.” Despite his angst toward bitcoin, the economist has said in the past that central banks fuel wealth loss and the world could use less of them. However, Hanke is a fan of the creation of currency boards, which essentially leverages monetary authority to maintain a fixed exchange rate with foreign currencies.In more recent times, Hanke has said that “private, digital money is nothing new. Most money has been produced privately and in a digital form for decades,” Hanke claims. In an opinion editorial published via the National Review, Hanke stressed that “the case for crypto as a driver of innovation is thin.”What do you think about Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele provoking Steve Hanke to respond?

422,Bitcoin's Unknown Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Is Now the 20th Wealthiest Person on Earth,"Oct 17, 2021","In mid-April the creator of the Bitcoin network, Satoshi Nakamoto entered the world’s top 20 richest billionaire list but after bitcoin’s price dropped, the inventor’s wealth plummeted. This week, Nakamoto has once again joined the top 20 richest people on the face of the earth. The last time, Nakamoto made the 19th position, and this time around, Bitcoin’s inventor is now the 20th richest person(s) on the face of the planet. The leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC) has skyrocketed past the $60K handle and tapped a high of $62,945 on Friday. Using today’s exchange rate and the estimated stash of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto reportedly owns, indicates that Bitcoin’s inventor is the 16th richest person or persons worldwide. The last time Bitcoin.com News reported on this subject, Nakamoto climbed from the 159th richest person in the globe to the 19th in a mere five months. Using today’s BTC exchange rates on October 17, 2021, six months later, Nakamoto is now the 20th richest person(s) worldwide.The reason why people assume Satoshi Nakamoto owns all this wealth, is because it is estimated that Bitcoin’s inventor owns around 1 million BTC. Of course, there are lower-bound estimates which say the inventor only collected 750,000 BTC and then upper-bound estimates that assume Nakamoto has more than 1.1 million BTC. The crypto community at large assumes that Nakamoto has around 1 million bitcoin and because he, she or they acquired it during the first year of BTC’s existence, the inventor owns all the forks tied to the stash as well.This means that on October 17, 2021, Nakamoto owns roughly $60.7 billion in bitcoin (BTC), $625 million in bitcoin cash (BCH), $169 million in bitcoinsv (BSV), and $191 million in ecash (formerly known as BCHA or Bitcoin ABC). That’s a grand total of $60.9 billion between those four networks which places Bitcoin’s inventor at the 20th position in Forbe’s real-time billionaires’ list. Satoshi Nakamoto is above the net worth of ​​Zhang Yiming, the billionaire from China. However, Nakamoto’s wealth is below the world’s 19th richest as Walmart’s Rob Walton has around $75.3 billion to his name.What’s pretty amazing is that one of the world’s 20 richest people in the world is the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin. A person or group of people that have yet to spend a single penny of the $60.9 billion worth of crypto assets. Some people assume that Nakamoto may have passed away and this is why the inventor has never and will never spend the stash of 1 million coins collected when the creator kick-started the BTC network. However, Nakamoto may still be alive and may still have access to these riches.Bitcoin’s inventor still has to catch up to the world’s two richest people which include Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos respectively. Musk has around $214.8 billion in wealth today according to Forbe’s real-time billionaires’ list and Jeff Bezos owns around $197.8 billion. In order to overtake Musk’s net worth, a single BTC will need to be valued at over $215K per unit. If BTC taps $100K this year, Bitcoin’s inventor will be in the top 10 richest person(s) list next to Warren Buffet and Mukesh Ambani.What do you think about Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto becoming the 20th richest person(s) on planet earth?

423,President of Mexico Denies Having Interest in Adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender,"Oct 17, 2021","The President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, denied having any interest in adopting cryptocurrencies as legal tender in the country. The statements, offered in a press conference in the National Palace this week, also confirmed that the Mexican government will keep dealing with the financial matters of the country in a traditional and orthodox way.The President of Mexico stated his opinions about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies earlier this week. In a press conference offered at the National Palace, Lopez Obrador denied having any interest in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, as El Salvador did earlier this year. When asked by a journalist about the matter, he stated:No. We are not going to change in this aspect. We see fit to maintain the orthodoxy in managing finances. We are not going to try to innovate a lot in the financial system.The statements serve to continue the stance Mexico has taken on cryptocurrencies to date. Lopez Obrador instead stated they would pay special attention to the tax situation in the country, ensuring tax collection goes normally, without evasion happening.We will ensure that there is no tax evasion and privileges in tax payments. This is enough.The current government of Mexico has had a negative relationship with cryptocurrencies. The president of the Bank of Mexico, Alejandro Diaz, denied that bitcoin was money or a good store of value based on its volatility, back in September. In the same vein, Finance Minister Arturo Herrera stated that cryptocurrencies could not be used in the financial system of the country “in order to maintain a healthy distance between them and the financial system” in June.However, this has not stopped people from trying to learn and include crypto in their investment portfolios and businesses. One of the richest men in the country, Ricardo Salinas, stated that Banco Azteca, his bank, was working to be the first to include bitcoin in the country. In fact, these statements prompted the Finance Minister to clarify that cryptocurrencies must exist separate from the traditional finance system, as explained before.In September, Salinas, who is also the owner of Elektra, one of the biggest retail franchises in Mexico, hinted at the adoption of Bitcoin payments in their stores using the Lightning Network, a second-layer protocol designed to allow for transactions with lower fees.What do you think about the opinion of the president of Mexico on not adopting bitcoin as legal tender in the country?

424,US Senator Lummis Thanks God for Bitcoin as Congress Discusses Raising Debt Ceiling,"Oct 16, 2021","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis said, “Thank God for bitcoin,” during her speech to the Senate about raising the U.S. debt limit. “Bitcoin is not issued by a government, so it is not beholding to the debts that are run up by governments,” she explained.Senator Cynthia Lummis praised bitcoin during her speech on the Senate floor last week about raising the U.S. debt limit. The senator has been a bitcoin hodler since 2013 and has repeatedly stated that bitcoin is a great store of value.Lummis pointed out that while lawmakers were intensely discussing raising the debt limit, “almost no one is talking about the debt” itself. “We are getting closer to $30 trillion. Certainly, if the spending that is being entertained by the majority party and the Biden administration passes, it will be over $30 trillion,” she warned.The senator from Wyoming explained:Countries have historically tended to decline once the debt surpassed their gross domestic product.Citing the Congressional budget office stating in February that the national debt would surpass the country’s GDP this year, the senator exclaimed: “The debt ceiling increase that is being discussed here is so more spending can occur without addressing our debt-to-GDP ratio. We cannot go on like this. It is irresponsible at the deepest levels.”The senator warned, “we are swiftly approaching a time when we will be unable to” pay our debt holders.She proceeded to share:One of the reasons that I became so interested in digital currencies, in non-fiat currencies, is because they are not issued by a government. Bitcoin is not issued by a government so it’s not beholding to the debts that are run up by governments.Lummis asserted, “If we are going to let the dollar decline, having the lessons of history in front of us, and failing to act, we are truly irresponsible.”She elaborated: “In the event that that contingency occurs, I want to make sure that non-fiat currencies — currencies not issued by governments, currencies not beholden to political elections — can grow, can allow people to save, can be there in the event that we fail at what we know we have to do.”Noting that “There’s no proof yet in the 21st century that we are going to make this right. Time and again, in the U.S. House and the Senate, time and again, presidents of both parties have run up the debt irresponsibly, with no plan to address it,” the senator described, adding:So, thank God for bitcoin, and other non-fiat currencies, that transcends the irresponsibility of governments, including our own. That is an indictment of our responsibility … to address this looming, predictable, massive issue.What do you think about Senator Lummis’ comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

425,"Mark Cuban Won't Invest in Bitcoin ETF, Prefers to Buy BTC Directly","Oct 16, 2021","The owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has said “no” to investing in bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one of which could start trading next week in the U.S. The Shark Tank star does not see a reason for him to invest in a bitcoin ETF, emphasizing that he can buy the cryptocurrency directly.The Shark Tank star and owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has shared his thoughts on the heavily hyped bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF, the first bitcoin futures ETF could begin trading in the country as early as next week.However, Cuban is not planning to invest in a bitcoin ETF or a bitcoin futures ETF when one starts trading on an American exchange. Responding to a question in an interview with CNBC, published Friday, whether he plans to invest in any bitcoin-based ETF, the shark tank star bluntly replied:No. I can buy BTC directly.Cuban has been in the crypto space for quite some time. He previously called bitcoin “better gold than gold” due to its algorithmic scarcity, seeing the cryptocurrency as a store of value rather than a currency. He said in April:That’s why I own bitcoin and why I never sold it.The owner of the Dallas Mavericks also previously revealed that he had invested in ether (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a number of blockchain companies. He and Tesla CEO Elon Musk see dogecoin as the “strongest” cryptocurrency for payments.As for cryptocurrency regulation, Cuban believes that the rules are unclear and has publicly criticized the SEC for taking an enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto industry. “The problem isn’t that people are looking for grey areas, it’s that there rarely are defined rules. Regulation through litigation traps all the people who can’t afford a lawyer, accountant, or advisor,” he opined.While futures-based bitcoin ETFs provide investors with some exposure to the crypto market without actually owning any coins, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, explained:The ETF price will not match the price of bitcoin. As such, it is likely better for short-term exposure than for buy and hold long-term investing.What do you think about Mark Cuban’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

426,Jack Dorsey Says Square Is Considering Building a 'Bitcoin Mining System Based on Custom Silicon',"Oct 16, 2021","Following the latest report from Cambridge University that shows a large percentage of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate resides in the United States, the CEO of Twitter and Square, Jack Dorsey, has announced that Square is considering building a “bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon.”On the same day the CFTC fined Tether Limited and Bitfinex, and the filings that give the impression that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Proshares Trust bitcoin futures ETF, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Square is possibly jumping into the bitcoin mining industry. Dorsey has been a bitcoin proponent for years and he recently explained that Square is in the midst of building a bitcoin hardware wallet in order to “make bitcoin custody more mainstream.”In recent times Dorsey has also said that bitcoin will be a big part of Twitter’s future. He shared a URL link to a book called “Anatomy of the State” by the economist Murray Rothbard, and Twitter just recently launched a bitcoin tipping feature. Now Dorsey and Square are considering joining the bitcoin mining industry and aim to approach the ecosystem in a different fashion.“Square is considering building a bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide,” Dorsey said on Friday. “If we do this, we’d follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community.”Dorsey believes mining needs to be “more distributed” and the “more decentralized this is, the more resilient the Bitcoin network becomes.” At the same time, the Square founder said the mining industry needs to progress toward “clean and efficient energy use” and to Dorsey, this requires “innovation in silicon, software, and integration.”“Silicon design is too concentrated into a few companies,” Dorsey further remarked. “This means supply is likely overly constrained. Silicon development is very expensive, requires long-term investment, and is best coupled tightly with software and system design,” he added. Dorsey also said:There isn’t enough focus on vertical integration. Considering hardware, software, productization, and distribution requires accountability for delivering to an end customer vs improving a single technology in the chain.He added that he believes mining is not accessible to everyone, and everyone should be able to plug in a rig and mine. But there’s a lot of complexity and barriers to entry, Dorsey highlighted, and he asked his Twitter followers: “What are the biggest barriers for people running miners?” Toward the end of his thread, he said that Jesse Dorogusker “will start the deep technical investigation required to take on this project.”What do you think about Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey saying Square is considering joining the bitcoin mining industry?

427,Bitcoin Mining Operation Being Sued for Producing High Noise Levels in Tennessee,"Oct 16, 2021","A bitcoin mining operation in Tennessee is being sued by neighbors due to the high level of noise the facility produces. The lawsuit, which was filed in August, asks mining operator Red Dog to shut down operations and pay personal damages fees, as well as compensate owners for decreased property values. The lawsuit could set a precedent for other cases now that Bitcoin mining companies are seeking to migrate to new zones previously ignored.Red Dog Technologies, the owner of a Bitcoin mining operation located in the U.S. state of Tennessee, is being sued by a member of a neighboring community due to the amount of noise the operation produces. According to reports from local media, the complaint states that the noise coming from the mine creates a situation that “unreasonably interferes” with the “use and enjoyment” of the plaintiff’s property.Worries about the mine disturbing citizens and the legality of the operation have already been raised to Washington County Mayor Joe Grandy, who was informed about the issue in June. Apparently, the mine didn’t comply with the zoning requirements to perform cryptocurrency mining operations in the area. Red Dog reportedly tried to dampen the noise last summer, but commissioners weren’t satisfied.While some might see this lawsuit as just another common complaint, it has special importance that could set a precedent for similar cases now that mining companies are setting up in regions that were ignored previously. At the core of the complaint is a rezoning proposal that Brightridge, the power company that leases the property to Red Dog, the mine operator, requested from the county to be able to operate the facility (that is described as a blockchain data center) in the zone.The complaint states that the rezoning request, proposing to change the zone type from General Agriculture to Agriculture Business, is not accurate enough to be considered valid. The request states that “while there are small fans on the data centers that generate noise, the petitioner has advised that the noise is considered small and will not impact or be heard from adjoining properties.”The current case could result in the closure of the bitcoin mining facility, now that the planning commission of the county has voted unanimously to shut down the mine and pursue legal action against the operator if the company fails to comply.What do you think about this lawsuit?

428,New SEC Filings Give the Impression US Regulators Approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF,"Oct 16, 2021","The price of bitcoin jumped over 8% during the last 24 hours after a number of documents stemming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) web portal indicated that the Proshares Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be listed as soon as next week. Proshares filed a post-effective amended prospectus on Friday that shows the firm’s intention to launch on Monday, October 18 on NYSE Arca.The crypto community watched the price of bitcoin (BTC) jump awfully close to the crypto asset’s all-time high on Friday afternoon. During the late afternoon trading sessions, BTC tapped a daily high of $62,945 per unit at around 5:30 p.m. (EST). The reason for this increase is likely due to a number of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeming to strongly indicate a bitcoin ETF is launching soon.The first signal was from James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who tweeted about Bloomberg’s data team “adding the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF to the terminal.” Seyffart further added: “[The] ticker will be $BITO. 95 bps — less than half $GBTC’s 2% fee. This thing is going live next week. Either Monday or Tuesday.” Sharing this Form 8A document, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst continued:Also should add that [Valkyrie Funds] has filed their 8A which essentially registers a security for trading on [an] exchange. Nothing from Proshares on that front yet. So Valkyrie [is almost] certainly going to begin trading next week as well if I had to guess.In addition to Seyffart’s commentary on Twitter, Proshares filed a post-effective amended prospectus for its ETF on Friday. The amended documents note that the Proshares bitcoin ETF intends to launch on October 18, 2021, and the filing also notes the ticker will be called “$BITO.” While the Proshares ETF could be the first to be listed as an approved bitcoin ETF by U.S. regulators, it will deal with bitcoin derivatives.The Proshares ETF will be a bitcoin futures-based product and analysts are doubtful a BTC spot market ETF will get the green light by the SEC this year. There’s been a lot of confusion about whether the SEC actually approved a bitcoin ETF on October 15 and there’s speculation signals could change. Seyffart’s Friday afternoon commentary on Twitter also shares a tweet he wrote on October 8 when he stated:The SEC has pulled the rug on approval so many times before, I can’t help but wonder what’s around the corner. We (and all the potential issuers) are basically Charlie Brown trying to kick a football.People are still skeptical because the U.S. regulator has rejected bitcoin ETFs in a vocal manner, but hasn’t said anything officially about approving a crypto exchange-traded fund. Others have also shared documents concerning Valkyrie’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund, as many have been speculating about its approval.Still, a few individuals have said the 8A document concerning Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF does not necessarily mean guaranteed approval.“The SEC has not approved Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF…yet,” the Twitter account Bitcoin Archive told its 539,600 followers. “This is a notice from Nasdaq to the SEC saying they have approved the securities and awaiting a decision from the SEC. That is all.”Vaneck’s Gabor Gurbacs responded to Bitcoin Archive’s tweet and said: “Good catch. There are so many approvals so people no longer [know] when an actual approval is. LOL.” Bitcoin Archive replied to the Vaneck executive and said: “Bloomberg guys think it’s 99% certain Mon/Tue, but we don’t have confirmation until [the] SEC says so.”What do you think about the new SEC filings that give the impression the U.S. regulator approved a bitcoin futures-based ETF?

429,Bitcoin Price Smashes $61.7K High — Leading Crypto Asset Needs to Gain Over 5% to Reach ATH,"Oct 15, 2021","The price of bitcoin has continued to push toward higher prices as the leading crypto asset has tapped a high of $61,749 per unit on Friday. The crypto asset came awfully close (around 5.3% away) from tapping the all-time price high reached six months ago on April 14.Bitcoin (BTC) has done phenomenally well during the last two weeks as October has been a good month for the leading crypto asset. On October 15, 2021, BTC tapped a high of $61,430 per unit. The crypto asset is very close to reaching its all-time high of $64,804 per unit captured six months ago.BTC’s market valuation this Friday is coasting along at $1.15 trillion and bitcoin is currently the eighth-most valuable asset worldwide. BTC market dominance has increased to 44.57% while ethereum (ETH) dominance stands at 17.6%.Metrics show out of the $156 billion in global trading volume between all the coins in existence, BTC commands $46.5 billion of those trades. Tether (USDT) captures 55.9% of today’s BTC trades, followed by USD (16.28%), BUSD (5.44%), JPY (4.12%), EUR (3.77%), and KRW (2.72%).In a note sent to Bitcoin.com News, Etoro’s crypto asset analyst Simon Peters says that the spike is likely due to expectations of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. “After a week of building expectations and momentum, bitcoin has hit $60k again for the first time in almost six months,” Peters said.“Today’s spike appears to have been triggered by investors’ growing confidence that US regulators will approve the launch of an ETF based on bitcoin futures contracts – but a rise past $60,000 has been looking likely for a while now after weeks of positive net inflows into bitcoin from institutional investors, a growing migration of bitcoin from short-term holders to long-term holders, and the attendant squeeze on bitcoin supply,” the Etoro crypto asset analyst added.Mikkel Morch, the executive director and risk management at crypto/digital assets hedge fund ARK36, says the price increase is clearly due to the rumors that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to approve a bitcoin ETF. “It is clear that the recent spike in BTC’s price is directly related to the rumour that the SEC will move ahead with the US first Bitcoin ETF approval,” Morch said on Friday.“It is becoming increasingly likely that at least one of the major contenders for a BTC futures ETF, such as Valkyrie or Vaneck, could be approved in the coming days and ahead of SEC’s hard November deadlines,” Morch continued. “As Valkyrie Investments updated its futures-backed ETF prospectus with the ticker BTF on Wednesday, the company is thought to have the biggest chances of winning this race,” the ARK36 executive added.What do you think about bitcoin skyrocketing to new heights on Friday?

It’s not the first time bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the social media company’s entire value, as Bitcoin.com News reported that BTC grew larger than Facebook during the first week of January this year.Interestingly, at that time, BTC was only changing hands for $41,462 per unit while Facebook’s market cap was $758 billion. Today, both BTC’s and Facebook’s market caps are higher and Facebook is valued at $926.27 billion. Alongside this, in January 2021, BTC still had yet to surpass Tesla, but today’s market valuations show BTC is two spots ahead of the electric car manufacturer. BTC is also ahead of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) as the overall worth of BRK-A shares is $636.97 billion on Friday.The next asset BTC needs to surpass is silver (Ag) as all the silver in the world today is estimated to be worth $1.313 trillion. BTC’s $1.119 trillion valuation needs to exceed 17.33% in order to get past the overall net worth of the global silver supply. In addition to silver, gold (Au), Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon are ahead of BTC as well. BTC has a long way to go to outpace the top precious metal, Au, as it must gain more than 905% just to outperform gold’s global worth.In order to beat the second most valuable global asset, Apple (AAPL), the leading crypto-asset must exceed gains of more than 112.3%. At that point, BTC would be the second-most valuable asset worldwide. In order for BTC to overtake AAPL’s overall market valuation, the crypto would need to be valued at $125,257 per unit. Of course, that $125K estimate is based on the number of BTC in circulation today and by then more bitcoins will be issued which means the $125K estimate would likely be lower.With Friday’s current 18,844,512 circulating supply of BTC in existence, in order to beat gold, each bitcoin would have to be worth $619,500. Another interesting fact is that if BTC ever surpasses Apple and comes close to the overall market valuation of gold, Bitcoin’s unknown inventor will be the world’s richest person (or group).What do you think about bitcoin as the world’s eighth most valuable asset and how the crypto recently surpassed social media giant, Facebook?

431,ETC Group Releases Bitcoin Cash Report Praising High Usage and Vibrant Development,"Oct 15, 2021","ETC Group, an ETF issuer company, released a report last month about the evolution of Bitcoin Cash in the years after the hard fork that created it. While the company acknowledged the asset price is lagging compared to its older sibling, it praised the crypto on other aspects like development and actual usage. Bitcoin Cash has improved regarding these two metrics, likely helped by the inclusion in several important platforms such as Paypal.ETC Group, a financial services company based in London, has issued a report on Bitcoin Cash. The report, which touches on several important aspects of the cryptocurrency, establishes that Bitcoin Cash has experienced positive development when it comes to the actual usage of the currency. The report states:Bitcoin Cash has retained its laser focus on facilitating easy, fast, everyday transactions. And this is starting to pay off. Daily active addresses, a proxy for daily active users, have continued to grow strongly in the past two years.What’s interesting about this is that adoption has grown even when spot prices have not accompanied this growth. This suggests that usage, rather than speculation, is the driving force behind Bitcoin Cash adoption, something very different from other cryptocurrencies. However, the report does state that prices have stagnated when compared with other cryptos on the market.Growth may also have been driven by the inclusion of Bitcoin Cash on the initial roster of Paypal’s supported cryptocurrencies in November 2020. This movement put the asset in the hands of people new to the crypto space, providing the option to invest in bitcoin cash to a wide market.The report also states that development has been constant since the 2017 hard fork that gave birth to BCH. This development, according to ETC, is what differentiates Bitcoin Cash from other crypto networks like Litecoin, which has stopped the addition of new features for its targeted use case. The report stresses:There are scores of other utility developments in play that are adding to its practicality, developing tools like smart contracts, prediction markets, and EVM-compatible content.Smartbch just launched earlier this year, bringing smart contract capabilities and Ethereum-like decentralized finance apps to the chain. The nascent project still has a lot of room to grow, but constant development such as this seems to have been an influential factor in ETC Group’s assessment of the peer-to-peer electronic cash system.What do you think about ETC Group’s BCH report?

However, the executive says he is fascinated by people’s interest in crypto and sees “a huge role for a digitized currency.”Larry Fink, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager with $9.5 trillion in assets under management, Blackrock, answered some questions about cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin, in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.He was asked whether he was “still in the Jamie Dimon’s category of ‘bitcoin is worthless'” or whether he saw value in the cryptocurrency. Dimon, the CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan, said earlier this week: “I personally think that bitcoin is worthless.” He also questioned the limited supply of the cryptocurrency.The Blackrock executive replied:I am probably more on the Jamie Dimon camp. But I am fascinated by so many people’s interest. It’s fantastic. I love the fact that more people are looking to invest in different things. I believe this is a very good, positive action.Fink added: “I’m not a student of bitcoin and where it’s going to go. I can’t tell you whether it’s going to be going to $80,000 or zero.”However, the CEO opined: “But I do believe there is a huge role for a digitized currency. And I believe that’s going to help consumers worldwide, whether it’s bitcoin or something else, or more of a governmental official digital currency, a digital dollar — that will play out.”The Blackrock executive further explained that he is fascinated by “the great new technology.” Noting that “It’s attracted so many people,” he expressed: “It’s fantastic seeing how people have become so fascinated about it, that they are showing interest in this. Whether this is going to play out well in the long run, we’ll see.” Fink concluded:I see huge opportunities in a digitized crypto, blockchain-related currency, and that’s where I think it’s going and that’s going to create some big winners and some big losers.What do you think about Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s comments?

Noting that they are not going to go away, he said: “We’re watchful of it, we’re respectful, and we’ll wait and see how the regulators handle it.”Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman talked about bitcoin and cryptocurrency during the bank’s third-quarter earnings call with analysts Thursday morning.Emphasizing that crypto is not going to go away, he said:I’ve said it publicly before, I’ll say it again. I don’t think crypto’s a fad. I don’t know what the value of bitcoin should or shouldn’t be, but these things aren’t going away.He added: “The blockchain technology supporting it is obviously very real and powerful.”Morgan Stanley was among the first major banks to embrace bitcoin. In March, the bank revealed that it had begun offering bitcoin funds to clients. In April, the bank added bitcoin to 12 mutual funds’ investment strategies.The global investment bank launched a dedicated cryptocurrency research team in September, led by Sheena Shah, the firm’s crypto analyst. “The launch of dedicated crypto research is in recognition of the growing significance of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets in global markets,” the bank explained.The Morgan Stanley executive explained during the earnings call, “We’re not directly trading crypto for retail clients,” adding that “there are other players who are choosing to do that.” He clarified, “We give access to them to buy crypto through various funds and things.”He further detailed that crypto is currently not a big part of the bank’s business but said it could grow in the future. “For us, honestly, it’s just not a huge part of the business demand from our clients. And that may evolve and we’ll evolve with it,” he opined, elaborating:We’re watchful of it, we’re respectful, and we’ll wait and see how the regulators handle it.Do you agree with Morgan Stanley’s CEO about bitcoin and crypto?

434,SEC Tweets About Funds Holding Bitcoin Futures — Expectations of Impending Bitcoin ETF Approval Soar,"Oct 14, 2021","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has tweeted about investing in funds that hold bitcoin futures contracts. This has sparked optimism within the crypto community that the regulator may soon approve bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially those investing in bitcoin futures.The official Twitter account for the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy tweeted Thursday: “Before investing in a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts, make sure you carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits.”The tweet references an investor bulletin jointly published in June by the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC’s) Office of Customer Education and Outreach. The bulletin urges “investors considering a fund with exposure to the bitcoin futures market to weigh carefully the potential risks and benefits of the investment.”Comments flooded Twitter from people speculating that the SEC will soon approve a bitcoin futures ETF. Many people simply exclaimed, “bullish.”One Twitter user wrote, “They probably wouldn’t post this if it wasn’t going to get approved.” Another commented, “Posting this would indicate with great likelihood a BTC ETF is coming, possibly next week.” A third person said, “This is a clear indication of what is to come very very soon.” As Bitcoin.com News reported, the SEC could approve several bitcoin strategy ETFs this month.Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, opined:Getting closer: The SEC just tweeted out an edu bulletin they wrote back in June re bitcoin futures and ‘funds that hold bitcoin futures.’ Clearly good sign and we [are] upping our odds to 85%.Balchunas mentioned another sign that a bitcoin ETF approval may be imminent. “Valkyrie just updated their bitcoin futures ETF prospectus (which typically only happens when ducks in row ready for launch). They added their ticker $BTF, altho no fee still. Can’t say this is done deal type evidence but a good sign IMO,” he tweeted Wednesday.However, since the investor bulletin was published in June and the SEC tweeted a similar message about investing in funds holding bitcoin futures back then, some people cautioned that Thursday’s tweet does not indicate a bitcoin ETF approval.Economist and trader Alex Kruger noted: “Market interpreting this SEC post as odds of bitcoin futures ETF increased dramatically but note the SEC had posted the same thing back in June.”Balchunas further detailed that the last time the SEC tweeted this bulletin was on July 26, one day before the Profunds’ bitcoin strategy mutual fund “went effective” and two days before it launched. He concluded that if the pattern holds, “Proshares ETF will be trading Mon or Tue (which was our prediction all along).”The crypto community is hopeful that the SEC will approve bitcoin futures ETFs since SEC Chairman Gary Gensler repeatedly indicated that he is open to this type of investment. He also said that he looked forward to the staff’s review of bitcoin futures ETF filings.Do you think the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF this year? Let us know in the comments section below.

436,"A Look at How Buckminster Fuller Predicted Bitcoin: 'A Realistic, Scientific Accounting System of What Is Wealth'","Oct 14, 2021","Richard Buckminster Fuller was a well known American architect, systems theorist, author, and inventor. Similar to the visions expressed by the industrialist Henry Ford, the Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek, and Austrian economist Milton Friedman, Buckminster Fuller also predicted a concept that resembled Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin invention 54 years ago in 1967.In a recent editorial, Bitcoin.com News discussed how the famed industrialist Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, envisaged an idea that’s similar to Bitcoin roughly 100 years ago. It was further said that before cypherpunks like Timothy May and Eric Hughes wrote about digital cash, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman also predicted a technology that would operate similarly to Satoshi’s Bitcoin project. Buckminster Fuller was another intelligent individual who predicted the invention of cryptocurrencies and new wealth.Fuller was not a fan of the financial system years before his passing on July 1, 1983. People referred to Fuller as the “grandfather of the future,” and the systems theorist often said: “God wanted all humans to be rich.” In a video interview with Fuller in 1967, the inventor talks about a new currency that will spark a new movement of wealth by 2018.“I’ll have to talk about something which will be one of the very big, new realizations by 2000 AD,” Fuller said in the interview. “A realistic — scientific accounting system — of what is wealth … wealth isn’t the gold that the old pirates used to have — wealth is energy,” he added.It was 1967 Buckminster Fuller predicted Bitcoin and new wealth.“I'll talk about something that would be one of the realizations by 2018 a realistic—scientific accounting system—of what is wealth. Wealth isn't the gold of pirates—wealth is energy""1967.pic.twitter.com/r0MM65E7kJ— Brian Roemmele (@BrianRoemmele) December 17, 2020Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” wrote about Fuller predicting the coming of bitcoin back in 1967 as well. Kiyosaki and a friend went to see Fuller speak at the Montreal, Canada Expo Center to see Fuller’s geodesic dome. In 1981, Kiyosaki was invited to “spend a week studying with Dr. Fuller at a lodge outside of Lake Tahoe.” The best-selling author stressed:I believe that what Fuller predicted was the blockchain technology upon which cryptocurrencies are built.Kiyosaki details and quotes Fuller on several occasions throughout his memoirs remembering the famed inventor. The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author explained that decades before Satoshi Nakamoto dropped Bitcoin on the world, Fuller envisioned a “complete reengineering of the global economy facilitated by a synchronized accounting system integrated with a global energy network.” Kiyosaki emphasized that Fuller’s forecast said that the U.S. dollar would be “replaced with a new money—a money made of energy by energy.”Published in 1981, alongside Fuller’s “Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth,” the book “Critical Path” is considered one of Fuller’s best-known works. In the book, Fuller says: “Computers make it practical to electronify wealth distribution games that accomplish the movement of goods in services in more channeled, designed structures. Not big brother though, since no central planning authority—just lots of dial-in ‘games’ with costs and rewards, likely to attract those with a self-interest in playing.”Author Garrison Breckenridge also highlights in his editorial called “What Blockchain Can Learn from One Man’s Attempt to Save the World” how Fuller envisioned Satoshi’s technological breakthrough. It’s well known that Fuller was a man who thought outside the box when it comes to changes and technological inventions. The systems theorist and author knew quite well that the old systems of finance and governance were antiquated and could not be fixed by fighting the status quo’s current infrastructure. Fuller is famously quoted for saying:You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.What do you think about Buckminster Fuller predicting bitcoin back in 1967?

437,Geographic Distribution Data Shows US Takes Leading Bitcoin Mining Position After China’s Crackdown,"Oct 13, 2021","After China has reigned for a number of consecutive years as the dominant bitcoin mining epicenter of the world, the United States has “taken the leading position in bitcoin mining,” according to new data from Cambridge University.In mid-July, researchers from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) project published new data from the website’s “Bitcoin Mining Map,” which had not been updated since April 2020. In that specific report, CBECI researchers noted that China’s hashrate dominance was much lower than in previous estimates. On October 13, CBECI researchers published updated data on all the countries participating in bitcoin mining and where most of the mining activity is taking place these days.“The latest update to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) has confirmed the impact of the Bitcoin mining crackdown in China,” the report detailed. “[It shows] that the leading share of global Bitcoin network hashrate now sits in the US, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.” The CBECI researchers added:This new data (to the end of August 2021) shows the US with a global hashrate share of 35.4% (up from 16.8% at the end of April), Kazakhstan with 18.1% (up from 8.2%), and the Russian Federation with 11% (up from 6.8%). This confirms the hashrate trajectory identified in the last update (to end April 2021) which showed those three countries were already gaining market share prior to the crackdown in China.Since June 28, 2021, the Bitcoin network hashrate climbed 101.44% from 69 exahash per second (EH/s) to today’s 139 EH/s hashpower measurement. Michel Rauchs, digital assets lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, discussed how China’s crackdown helped fuel the shift in global bitcoin mining.“The immediate effect of the government mandated ban on crypto mining in China was a 38% drop in global network hash rate in June 2021 – which corresponds roughly to China’s share of hashrate before the clampdown, suggesting that Chinese miners ceased operations simultaneously,” Rauchs suggested.Besides the new top three countries leading the hashpower race, the next largest hashrate shares reside in countries like Canada (9.55%), Ireland (4.68%), Malaysia (4.59%), Germany (4.48%), Iran (3.11%), and Norway (0.58%). CBECI’s report highlights that while the U.S. got some hashrate from fleeing Chinese miners, the crackdown also “increased geographic distribution of hashrate across the world.”“It is worth noting that the shares for Ireland and Germany are likely due to a growing number of miners rerouting through those countries via VPNs or proxy servers, rather than growing mining activity for which there is little or no evidence,” the CBECI report explains.What’s also interesting is the fact that at least four out of the five top mining pools today originally stem from China and now many of them operate internationally and in unknown regions. F2pool, formally known as “Discus Fish” started mining bitcoin (BTC) on May 5, 2013, and was originally based in China.F2pool commands 26.76 EH/s in hashpower and around 19.39% of the global hashrate today. Antpool, owned and operated by Bitmain, also initially came from China and is the second-largest hashing pool on October 13. Antpool captures 16.59% of the global hashrate with its 22.89 EH/s of hashpower. There’s also the top mining pools Viabtc and Poolin, which begs the question:Where do these mining facilities and pools originate from now?What do you think about the recently published Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) mining map report?

438,Bank of Spain Criticizes El Salvador's Foray Into Bitcoin,"Oct 13, 2021","The Bank of Spain, the central bank of the country, criticized the adoption process El Salvador chose when declaring Bitcoin legal tender last month. In a report titled “The role of crypto assets as legal tender: the example of El Salvador,” the bank examines several pain points the country encountered while applying its bitcoin strategy, and raises concerns about how some actions have been taken with little transparency.The Bank of Spain issued a report scrutinizing and reflecting upon the entrance of El Salvador into the Bitcoin world. The report, titled “The role of crypto assets as legal tender: the example of El Salvador,” written by Sergio Gorjón, of the General Directorate of Operations, Markets and Payment Systems, states that as every first-mover, El Salvador committed many mistakes in the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender.One of the principal worries of the Bank of Spain has to do with the relative lack of transparency the project has exhibited. The report states:The opacity and lack of consensus with which the project has been carried out has been another limiting factor. Thus, the main global rating agencies agreed to carry out a downward revision of El Salvador’s sovereign credit rating.The Bank of Spain found other problems regarding El Salvador’s move towards Bitcoin. The institution agreed with the opinion of Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, who stated that virtually forcing Bitcoin on an untrained, non-crypto-savvy population was risky. The Bank of Spain stressed:With just over 50% of its population with Internet access and a market share of smartphones that barely reaches 40%, El Salvador is at the bottom of the Central American countries in terms of the level of digital training.However, the bank praised El Salvador for the measures it is taking to address the worries of using bitcoin as a means of financing terrorism or for money laundering purposes. The bank stated that the regulation issued by the country contemplates these problems in a thorough way, and makes it possible to reinforce control measures against these risks.What do you think about the Bank of Spain’s opinion on El Salvador? Tell us in the comments section below.

The rigs are expected to start the delivery process by next month and the units were “partially funded through a portion of the company’s BTC holdings.” The company estimates that the machines will increase hashrate by 450 PH/s or 0.45 exahash (EH/s), which is equivalent to Cleanspark’s current capacity.Cleanspark’s acquisition of 4,500 bitcoin miners follows other major purchases of bitcoin mining machines by large-scale operations this year. For instance, at the end of August, Genesis Digital Assets bought 20,000 bitcoin miners from Canaan. During the first week of August, Marathon purchased 30,000 bitcoin mining rigs from Bitmain. Foundry US has been partnering with a number of operations and has increased in capacity a great deal. At the end of December 2020, Cleanspark acquired the U.S. bitcoin miner ATL Data Centers for $19.4 million.Cleanspark expects to increase its current supply of 10,000 miners. The number of miners scheduled for delivery is 24,580 “over the next 12 months.” In addition to ATL Data Centers, Cleanspark also bought a former Sprint/Nextel datacenter in Norcross, Georgia, and the new mining facility will leverage Georgia’s Simple Solar program. Zach Bradford, the CEO of the bitcoin mining and energy technology firm headquartered in Nevada, says the move to purchase the new miners was a “conscious effort.”“By making a conscious effort to reinvest in additional production, we are taking a market-based approach to our mining operations and maximizing value for our shareholders,” Bradford said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “We understand that using our bitcoin to support our operations and expansion is a paradigm shift for the digital currency mining industry in North America.”Not only does Cleanspark have a holding strategy, it also believes that “the value of digital currencies such as bitcoin stems from their usefulness as a medium of exchange.” Essentially, by using the funds to acquire more bitcoin mining rigs, a portion of its mined bitcoins goes back into circulation.What do you think about Cleanspark purchasing 4,500 miners from Bitmain and increasing capacity by 450 PH/s?

440,Bitfarms Starts Construction of Mega Bitcoin Mining Farm in Argentina,"Oct 12, 2021","Bitfarms, a bitcoin mining company, announced last week that construction is underway for a mega bitcoin mining farm in Argentina. The facility, which is designed to accommodate 55,000 miners, will be finished by next year. This is yet another signal that mining companies are looking for new areas with favorable conditions and cheap energy to migrate to, including places like Texas and El Salvador.Bitfarms, a Nasdaq-listed bitcoin mining company, announced it started building what will be a mega bitcoin mining farm in Argentina last week. The company says this facility will be able to power thousands of miners with power secured through a contract with a private power company. The farm will provide more than 210 megawatts of infrastructure capacity for the company, which reported having a mining power of 1.4 exahash per second in September.About the construction, Emiliano Grodzki, CEO of Bitfarms, stated:Our new high-production facility in Argentina, which is expected to accommodate over 55,000 miners upon completion, will greatly expand our capacity and global footprint.Grodzki noted this facility will help the company achieve its goal of eight exahash per second by the end of next year.Grodzki also pointed out the reasons why the company chose Argentina. The farm will be constructed in warehouses inside the power company providing the energy, creating a great location for Bitfarms. Bitfarms signed an eight-year, 210 MW deal that secures power provision at a very low price. Grodzki explained:The Argentina facility is planned to produce Bitcoin using power at the attractive rate of just US 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour, substantially reducing our already low cost of mining Bitcoin.The facility is already under construction with an Argentinian company called Proyectos y Obras Americanas S.A. (“PROA”), which will lay the electrical structure needed to power the installation. Bitfarms is just one of the mining companies seeking new locations offering favorable conditions for expanding, and Argentina is on that list, mostly due to its abundant and cheap energy in certain regions. Bitfarms took advantage of this, choosing a region where energy is plentiful and demand is low. Other companies could follow suit in the near future.What do you think about the Bitfarms mega bitcoin farm construction in Argentina? Tell us in the comment section below.

441,"JPMorgan Boss Jamie Dimon Says Bitcoin Is Worthless, Questions BTC's Limited Supply","Oct 11, 2021","The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, says bitcoin is “worthless,” questioning whether the supply of bitcoin is actually limited. He also noted that blockchain and stablecoins can be real, emphasizing that governments are going to regulate the industry.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his anti-bitcoin stance Monday at the 2021 Institute of International Finance (IIF) Annual Membership Meeting, which was held virtually.“Blockchain can be real, stablecoins can be real,” Dimon said. “No matter what anyone in the room thinks, nor what any libertarian thinks, nor what anyone thinks about it, government’s going to regulate it.” He opined:I personally think that bitcoin is worthless.But, “I don’t want to be a spokesperson. I don’t care. It makes no difference to me,” he added.Nonetheless, the JPMorgan boss emphasized: “Our clients are adults. They disagree. That’s what makes markets, so if they want to have access to buy yourself bitcoin, we can’t custody it but we can give them legitimate, as clean as possible, access.”The JPMorgan CEO has long been a bitcoin skeptic. Earlier this month, he said bitcoin had no intrinsic value and regulators will “regulate the hell out of it.” In May, he advised people to “stay away” from cryptocurrency. Despite Dimon’s anti-crypto stance, JPMorgan is currently offering several cryptocurrency investments to clients.Dimon reportedly went on to question bitcoin’s scarcity, specifically the cryptocurrency’s supply of 21 million coins, stating:I’ll just challenge the group to one other thing: how do you know it ends at 21 million? You all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that? I don’t know, I’ve always been a skeptic of stuff like that.Many people took to Twitter to comment on Dimon’s statement about the BTC supply. Some people expressed that they could not believe Dimon actually made the above statement while others posted the code for the JPMorgan executive to see.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong simply tweeted: “Yes, I read it. And then I wrote it (coding up our own Bitcoin node) to make sure I understand it.”Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz commented: “So strange. For a man who has done a brilliant job running a giant bank, his answers around BTC are sophomoric and he keeps doubling down on them. I pray I stay open-minded my whole life.”Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees wrote, “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.” Venture investor Stephen Cole opined, “Even the richest, most influential people in the world are clueless on Bitcoin.”What do you think about Jamie Dimon’s comments about bitcoin?

442,"Bitcoin Skyrockets Above $57K, Recaptures Trillion Dollar Market Cap, Double-Digit Weekly Gains","Oct 11, 2021","The price of bitcoin continues to climb higher as the crypto asset has captured over 19% in gains during the last seven days. Bitcoin tapped a daily high on Monday reaching $57,678 per unit, jumping 4.4% in the last 24 hours. It seems crypto investors are more attracted to bitcoin (BTC) in recent times as the crypto asset has been outperforming most of the top digital currencies in the last few days. On Monday, BTC has jumped 4.4% in value and BTC is the 14th-biggest seven-day gainer out of 10,000+ crypto-assets in existence.Much of the price increase has been attributed to the possibility that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund by the month’s end. While many investors see a bitcoin ETF approval as being positive, others have shared contrasting opinions about the subject in recent times.Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 19.3% during the last week and year-to-date, BTC is up 410.3%. The price push has increased BTC dominance as the metric has tapped 44.4% on Monday, while ethereum’s (ETH) market cap is 17.3%. With current prices above the $57K range, BTC’s market valuation is approximately $1,085,971,255,172, or just over $1 trillion.Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth management platform Yield App told Bitcoin.com News in an investor’s note that bitcoin is “set to test all-time highs and break into six-figures.” Frost spoke about the possibility of a bitcoin futures ETF getting approval and the recent approval of Volt Equity’s long, indirect exposure ETF.“Analysts are predicting a potential cool off, with bitcoin potentially falling to the $40,000 support level before continuing on the upwards trajectory to test the previous all-time high of $65,000,” Frost explained on Monday. He continued:A break of this level, in line with the stock to flow model, would likely see Bitcoin soar into the six-figure region and beyond toward the end of 2021 – a tantalizing prospect for investors hungry for that promised $100k level. Then, the approval of a Bitcoin futures ETF in the US would no doubt add rocket fuel to this already astronomical price target.Meanwhile, the dominant pair with BTC today is still tether (USDT) as the stablecoin captures 60.35% of all BTC trades on October 11. Tether is followed by USD (13.01%), BUSD (5.00%), JPY (4.07%), EUR (3.27%), and AUD (2.12%). Typically, when these three fiat currencies (JPY, EUR, AUD) have entered the top spots, markets are definitely more bullish.It is clear that other digital assets besides BTC are not seeing the lifts they usually would see when bitcoin spikes to higher levels. Most alternative crypto assets are seeing mediocre advances while BTC continues to outperform, holding on to its double-digit gains.What do you think about bitcoin’s recent gains outperforming the pack of competitors?

443,Pantera CEO Wants a Reminder the Day Before a US Bitcoin ETF Launches — 'I Might Want to Take Some Chips off the Table',"Oct 11, 2021","On October 6, Pantera Capital published an investor’s note written by Dan Morehead, the company’s CEO. Unlike the myriad of crypto investors who believe that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will send the crypto asset’s value to the moon, Morehead explains it could be a negative event and when it officially launches he said he “might want to take some chips off the table.”The price of bitcoin (BTC) is riding much higher than last month as the crypto asset tapped a high on Monday morning (EST) reaching $57,093 per unit. Four days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on the possibility of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) getting approved by the end of the month. It has been said that the probability of an ETF being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be high by the end of October and the beginning of November. Because of this higher probability, speculators think BTC’s price has been bolstered by the news.Last Wednesday, Dan Morehead and his firm Pantera Capital published a blog post called “The Next Price Era.” The blockchain investor letter discusses a number of subjects such as a “post-halving update,” “price cycles,” and includes one particular section that discusses a bitcoin ETF getting approved called “buy the rumor, sell the fact.” Morehead stresses that the line of thinking (buy the rumor, sell the fact) is “definitely working in our space.”“When he was the chairman of the CFTC, Chris Giancarlo pointed out a wild one I hadn’t put two and two together on,” Morehead wrote. “All during 2017, the markets were rallying with the mantra ‘When the CME lists bitcoin futures, we’re going to the moon!!!’ The markets did rally – 2,440% until **the very day** futures listed. That was the top. One of those -83% bear markets started that day,” the Pantera executive said. Morehead added:We recently repeated that cycle. The whole industry reveled in Coinbase’s upcoming direct listing. The bitcoin market was up 822% coming into the day of the listing. Bitcoin peaked at $64,863 that day and a -53% bear market started. Will someone please remind [me] the day before the bitcoin ETF officially launches? I might want to take some chips off the table.Over the years, there have been many discussions on whether or not an exchange-traded fund tethered to bitcoin (BTC) would be beneficial to the market price. In 2017, Tariq Dennison, in an opinion piece published with Seeking Alpha, says a “cryptocurrency ETF would divert attention to price speculation and higher volatility rather than to productive applications of blockchain technology.” Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos has even published a Youtube video called: “Bitcoin Q&A: Why I’m against ETFs” on August 14, 2018.Speculators believe a U.S.-based bitcoin ETF would allow investors from the country to invest and “real” bitcoin would be obtained by these funds making the currency even more scarce. On the other hand, some believe the market price of bitcoin (BTC) could get manipulated if an ETF is approved. Many investors believe that gold and silver ETFs were not helpful to precious metals markets and actually suppressed the price of gold and silver. Though the U.S. SEC has not approved a bitcoin ETF yet, this past March three North American bitcoin ETFs were approved by Canada’s securities regulators.The SEC has approved the Volt Crypto Industry Revolution and Tech ETF which doesn’t hold crypto assets but rather tracks “Bitcoin Industry Revolution Companies.” The ETF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the market ticker “BTCR.” Speculators assume the first bitcoin ETF will be tied to bitcoin futures markets offered by the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange CME Group.What do you think about Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead’s opinion on bitcoin ETF approval and what might happen after? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

444,Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele Announces Construction of Vet Hospital With Bitcoin Trust Funds,"Oct 11, 2021","Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, announced yesterday he will start using surplus funds from the country’s bitcoin trust. Part of the $4 million excedent will be invested in a vet hospital that will offer different services for the pets of Salvadoran citizens. Bukele explained this is possible due to the bitcoin price increase in the last few days.Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, announced yesterday the construction of a veterinary clinic with funds coming from the country’s recently created bitcoin trust. According to his statements, $4 million can be withdrawn from Fidebitcoin, the national bitcoin trust, due to the latest price increase BTC has experienced. Bukele explained on Twitter:With the same amount of dollars and bitcoin in the trust, the trust is now worth more as the bitcoin went up in value. So now, FIDEBITCOIN has a ‘surplus’ of $4 million. Therefore, the state company Chivo can dispose of 4 million dollars, without affecting the amount of the trust.Bukele then went on to announce the vet clinic would feature 12 offices, four emergency attention rooms, four operating rooms, and a rehabilitation area for Salvadoran pets. The facility will be able to attend to more than 384 pets each day.The president has been widely criticized for the way in which he handles public funds. With this project, critics of the president quickly pointed to problems, calling for an audit in the balances of the funds and stating these couldn’t be used for funding civil expenditures. However, Bukele was quick to explain the fund was not selling Bitcoin to fund these expenses. The president stated:By the way, we’re not selling any bitcoin, we are using the dollar part of the trust, since the bitcoin part is now worth more than when the trust was established.Bukele also took a swipe from Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, who criticized his push to declare bitcoin legal tender on Reddit. Buterin stated that Bukele’s action of pushing bitcoin on a population not adequately educated to use it was “reckless” and has “risks.” Buterin extended this criticism to other actors in the crypto industry by stating:Shame on everyone (ok, fine, I’ll call out the main people responsible: shame on Bitcoin maximalists) who are uncritically praising him.What do you think about Bukele’s idea of constructing a vet clinic with the bitcoin fund surplus?

445,How Henry Ford Envisaged Bitcoin 100 Years Ago — A Unique 'Energy Currency' That Could 'Stop Wars',"Oct 11, 2021","55 days from now will be the hundred-year anniversary of when the American industrialist and business magnate Henry Ford talked about a unique “energy currency” that could “stop wars.” The well known founder of the Ford Motor Company suggested that a currency could be backed by energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh) in a similar fashion to the way energy is leveraged to mine bitcoin.Close to 100 years ago on December 4, 1921, Henry Ford discussed an idea he conceived in the New York Tribune. The title of the published article was called “Ford Would Replace Gold With Energy Currency and Stop Wars.”Ford is well known for developing the assembly line technique and creating one of the first mass-produced American-built automobiles. Ford’s energy currency concept describes a digital currency much like Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin and one that is also scarce.Not only would Ford’s energy currency be backed by energy measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) he also discussed with the Tribune that the currency would “be issued only to a certain definite amount and for a specific purpose.”It has always been understood that Henry Ford was well ahead of his time, but he also thought about a concept that is very similar to what’s described in the Bitcoin white paper. Ford even had a location planned to kick start the idea at Muscle Shoals Dam. The treacherous and wild Muscle Shoals section of the Tennessee River produces a lot of energy as the dam provides electrical power, flood control, and a water supply.Ford even took shots at the banking cartel in 1921, which are basically the same financial institutions and family members running the world’s finances today. “It’s simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard,” Ford stressed.While the cypherpunks like Timothy May and Eric Hughes wrote about concepts that looked closer to today’s cryptocurrency, many others had visions similar to Henry Ford’s energy currency concept. The Nobel laureate and Austrian economist Friedrick Hayek discussed the idea of a free market currency.“I don’t believe we shall ever have good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of [the] government,” Hayek stressed. “That is, we can’t take it violently out of the hands of [the] government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way [to] introduce something that they can’t stop.”In addition to Hayek, Milton Friedman discussed the idea of a cryptocurrency in 1999. “I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government,” Friedman said during his interview that went viral in 2014. “The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A,” the economist added.Ford’s energy currency editorial in the New York Tribune not only takes aim at the bankers but blames gold as well. “It’s very simple when you analyze it,” Ford emphasized. “The cause of all wars is gold. We shall demonstrate to the world two things, first, the practicability, second, the desirability of displacing gold as the basis of currency and substituting in its place the world’s imperishable natural wealth.” Ford continued:Almost everybody in the world, except the newspapers and bankers recognizes that civilization has entered on a new era. The newspapers don’t see it and the international bankers don’t want to see it — It would mean changes in world finance and bankers always oppose changes.It could be said that the trend in America has already entered a realm of digital currency which is done mostly by the banking system’s databases. In many respects, Ford got his way because the powers that be essentially replaced gold with unbacked fiat. However, fiat is a far cry from a scarce and energy-backed currency Ford dreamt up long ago.The banking cartel moving off the gold standard has pushed a “desirability of displacing gold” from both sides of the spectrum. Decentralized crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC) are indeed displacing gold even if the measurement of displacement is still quite small.These days people use cryptocurrencies as a hedge against fiat and the central banks’ massive monetary expansions just like precious metal (PM) collectors and ‘gold bugs.’ In this line of thinking there is also a “desirability of displacing gold” forming among the masses as digital currencies offer benefits that PMs like gold cannot provide.According to assetdash.com bitcoin (BTC) is the sixth top asset by market cap. The web portal companiesmarketcap.com says bitcoin (BTC) is positioned in the eighth spot. The top position held by Gold is an $11.161 trillion market valuation, while BTC’s is roughly $1.041 trillion, according to the website’s metrics. Gold’s valuation is 972% larger than BTC’s as the crypto asset has a long way to go to catch up if it wants to displace gold.What do you think about Henry Ford predicting a currency similar to bitcoin close to 100 years ago? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

446,"5 Countries Will Accept Bitcoin as Legal Tender by End of Next Year, Says Bitmex CEO","Oct 10, 2021","By the end of next year, at least five countries will have accepted bitcoin as legal tender, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitmex has predicted. He cited three key reasons why he arrived at this conclusion. “Developing countries will jump into crypto in 2022,” he said.The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitmex, Alex Hoeptner, has predicted that developing countries will lead the way in bitcoin adoption. He detailed last week:My prediction is that by the end of next year, we’ll have at least five countries that accept bitcoin as legal tender. All of them will be developing countries. Here’s why I think developing countries will jump into crypto in 2022.The CEO offered three main factors driving the adoption of bitcoin in developing countries and why he came up with this prediction.The first is remittances. Remittances made up 23% of El Salvador’s GDP in 2020, Hoeptner described. Citing data from the World Bank, he added that low and middle-income countries receive about 75% of total global remittances and $540 billion in remittances reached low and middle income countries in 2020.“This money has got to find a way home somehow,” he said. “But the current system of remittances – led by money service providers like Western Union – is ripping people off by charging them an average of 10% just to send money home the next business day.”The second factor is inflation. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts inflation for developed countries in 2021 at 2.4% and 5.4% for developing countries.He explained that people seek alternatives to fiat currencies during inflation crises. For example, he said: “As inflation climbed well above 15% this year in Turkey, crypto adoption surged. Turkey responded by quickly banning the use of crypto for goods and services, but inflation is now at 19.25%.”Hoeptner noted:Bitcoin fixes this, with its capped supply of 21 million. And developed countries – and/or their people – are noticing.The third factor is politics. He explained that many politicians or rulers “are skilled and savvy, and have an interest in positioning themselves as progressive, populist, and new age thinkers.”He opined, “Over the next year, and as El Salvador works out the kinks in its rollout, savvy politicians will be thinking of how they can take a similar path, and how it might benefit both them and their constituents,” elaborating:What El Salvador did is take the first leap of faith, making similar moves by other countries much easier to consider.However, the CEO cautioned: “Any failings by these leaders in the implementation phase may hurt wider adoption of cryptocurrencies in general. That’s the dangerous dilemma that lies ahead.”Do you agree with Bitmex’s CEO? Let us know in the comments section below.

On Sunday, the hashrate dedicated to the Bitcoin network is hovering just above the 155 exahash (EH/s) handle and bitcoin’s price has made a great number of mining rigs more profitable. Older generation mining rigs like Bitmain’s Antminer S9 series with hashrate speeds around 11 TH/s or higher are also profiting.Six days ago, Bitcoin’s overall hashpower was around 130 exahash per second (EH/s) and today it’s up 19.23% at 155 EH/s. Bitcoin (BTC) markets have been doing well this week up 15.9% during the last seven days. On Sunday, a single BTC is exchanging hands for just above the $55K zone and there’s $35.2 billion in global trade volume.The higher price per BTC has made it so mining rigs are more profitable than they once were a few weeks ago in September. Using today’s BTC difficulty and electrical costs of around $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ is pulling in over $34 a day per machine. The M30S++ is powerful, of course, as each Microbt machine boasts 112 terahash per second (TH/s).The Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro (110 TH/s) also makes over $34 per day with the next-generation miner’s output. The Canaan Avalonminer 1246 boasts around 90 TH/s in hashrate and estimates show it can make $25.88 per day using today’s BTC exchange rates. The Strongu Hornbill H8 Pro shows it produces 84 TH/s and profits by $23.67 per day using current exchange rates.Older units like the Ebang Ebit E11++ (44 TH/s) and the Innosilicon T3 (43 TH/s) pull in anywhere between $11.02 to $11.77 per day in profit. The lowest hashpower producing bitcoin mining machine is the Bitmain Antminer T9 (11.5 TH/s) which can get a miner around $0.39 per day.Every single Bitmain Antminer S9 series also makes a profit, producing anywhere between $0.84 per day and $2.00 per day, depending on the S9 model. There haven’t been any new launches in recent times, except for a new mining rig manufacturer from Singapore called Ipollo.The Ipollo bitcoin miner called the B2 claims to produce 110 TH/s and pulls 3,250 watts from the wall. The mining rig’s current profit is $34.31 per day but the machine just came out this month. This means that the new company’s devices have not been out for that long and reviews are lackluster and sparse so far.On Sunday, the mining operation F2pool commands the most hashrate with 26.59 EH/s or 18.69% of the global network. F2pool is followed by Antpool (20.94 EH/s), Poolin (20.94 EH/s), Foundry USA (17.28 EH/s), and Viabtc (14.96 EH/s). Unknown hashrate or stealth miners capture 2.10% of the global hashrate and the 2.99 EH/s puts the mystery hash in the ninth position.The current mining difficulty is 19.89 trillion and in eight days it is expected to increase by 1.58%. This increase will put BTC’s mining difficulty back above the 20 trillion range making it close to 40% harder to mine BTC than three months ago.What do you think about mining machines gathering higher profits and the older generation mining rigs that can now gain profit? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The senator from Wyoming sees bitcoin as an “excellent store of value” that should be in every investment portfolio.The pro-bitcoin senator from Wyoming, Cynthia Lummis, disclosed her recent bitcoin purchase in a periodic transaction report (PTR) Thursday.According to the filing, the senator bought BTC worth between $50,001 and $100,000 on Aug. 16. The price of bitcoin was around $45K at that time.The disclosure was made outside of the 45-day reporting deadline set by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. The Act requires members of Congress to disclose every purchase and sale of individual stocks, bonds, and commodity futures valued over $1,000 within 45 days of the transaction.A spokesperson at Senator Lummis’ office told CNBC that the disclosure delay was due to “a filing error,” stating:Once we realized it we worked with the Ethics committee to fix it. It was an honest mistake, and the issue has been resolved without penalty.Lummis’ bitcoin purchase in August followed her indicating at the end of June that she was going to buy the dip as the price of bitcoin fell below $30K. Commenting on the falling BTC price, she said, “I’m really excited about it because as soon as it drops a little more I’m going to buy some more.”Senator Lummis is a longtime bitcoin supporter. She previously said that she bought her first BTC in 2013 for $330 and owned five bitcoins as of the end of June.“I really see it as a great store of value for individuals, for corporations, and for governments,” she commented about bitcoin in February, stating:I still think it is an excellent store of value and that it should be part of every individual person’s investment portfolio.What do you think about Senator Lummis buying more bitcoin?

450,Sat Symbol Initiative Attempts to Get Satoshi Design Widely Adopted by the Bitcoin Community,"Oct 8, 2021","Over the last few days, cryptocurrency advocates have been discussing the Sat Symbol initiative, a goal that aims to get a specifically designed symbol to represent the smallest unit of bitcoin and also get the symbol widely adopted. The Sat Symbol has been promoted by a number of crypto luminaries but others have offered alternative ideas.Most people know that Satoshi Nakamoto is the inventor of the Bitcoin protocol, the “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” that was launched on January 3, 2009. The word Satoshi has Japanese roots and the name translates into definitions such as ‘quick-witted,’ ‘clear thinking’, and ‘wise.’Furthermore, the popular anime Pokémon’s lead human character Ash Ketchum’s name is “Satoshi” in Japanese. While the name was used by Bitcoin’s inventor, the term “satoshi” (lowercase) is also the smallest unit of bitcoin.The term satoshi, when referring to bitcoin’s smallest unit, has been adopted far and wide by the crypto community at large. Around two years ago in mid-October 2019, Oxford University Press published its quarterly report explaining the word satoshi was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) database.The cryptocurrency bitcoin is divisible by up to eight decimal points. Each bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis and the protocol has a supply cap of roughly 21 million bitcoin. Now there’s an initiative that is attempting to get a symbol for bitcoin’s smallest unit adopted by the community at large.The web portal called satsymbol.com showcases the idea as three parallel horizontal lines and there’s a small vertical line above and below the stack of horizontal lines. The website shows the orange “B” bitcoin symbol and how it relates to the satoshi design concept in animated fashion.“Support the bitcoin design initiative to make this the official satoshi symbol – open, free, and unrestricted as Satoshi would have wanted – please share if you agree,” the satsymbol.com website details.On Thursday evening around 7 p.m. (EST), the term “satoshi” was trending with a large quantity of trending tweets sharing the Sat Symbol initiative’s design. Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor shared the web domain on Twitter and said: “May satoshi be with you.”The crypto pundit and self-proclaimed “bitcoin maximalist” Max Keiser decided to share an alternative idea that could represent the satoshi symbol. “Symbol for satoshi should be a tilde. It looks enough like the sign for infinity – and it’s on every keyboard. ~ 1,000,000 = 1 million sats,” Keiser added.Others shared the old-school S symbol (“Cool S,” also known as the “Stussy S,” or “Super S”) all the cool kids used to draw back in the day. Bitcoin proponent ​​Dennis Porter said he agreed with Keiser’s idea. “I agree with Max Keiser on the satoshi symbol. This is on every keyboard which will make it backward compatible,” Porter wrote.However, another person disagreed with Keiser’s take on the symbol and one person replied to Porter and said: “Max isn’t often wrong. He’s wrong on this one. This symbol is better,” while sharing a screenshot of the Sat Symbol initiative picture. A number of others tweeted about the Sat Symbol initiative on Thursday evening. The idea to call the smallest unit of bitcoin satoshi was conceived back in 2010 when an individual dubbed “Ribuck” proposed that one-hundredth of a bitcoin should be called satoshi to honor the protocol’s inventor.Ribuck’s idea has stuck around and most people use the term satoshi to represent the smallest unit of bitcoin but as far as the symbol goes, a widely adopted idea may not come to fruition.The attempt to tether a symbol to the term has been tried on many occasions but every one so far has ultimately failed. In July 2019, Square Crypto initiated a trend on Twitter when it asked people to share designs that could represent the smallest increment of bitcoin. One person told Square that he designed a fairly popular idea that had gained some traction.What do you think about the Sat Symbol initiative and the many attempts to get a symbol tied to bitcoin’s smallest unit?

451,Bitcoin.com Wallet Adds DApp Gateway WalletConnect,"Oct 8, 2021","The Bitcoin.com Team is excited to announce support for Ethereum-based DApps in the Bitcoin.com Wallet via WalletConnect. Earn interest on your cryptoassets, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces and more.WalletConnect is a bridge that securely connects DApps to crypto wallets. Once you’ve approved the connection between your wallet and a DApp, the DApp can send transaction requests to your wallet, which you must then approve or deny. You can find more information about WalletConnect here.Just go to any DApp website, locate the “Connect” or “Sign in” button, and select WalletConnect as the connection / sign in method. This brings up a QR code and a link. Then, in the Bitcoin.com Wallet, tap the QR code icon on the home screen and either scan the DApp’s QR code, or paste in the link.Once you confirm via the Wallet, you’ll be connected to the DApp. This will enable the DApp to see the contents of your Bitcoin.com Ethereum wallet and to send you transaction requests, which you both initiate (via the DApp’s website) and approve or deny (via your Wallet).You can also connect to DApps using WalletConnect with the desktop/web version of the Bitcoin.com Wallet.While in theory DApps can do anything traditional apps can do, the current processing restraints of decentralized networks like Ethereum mean DApps are primarily used for money-related activities. The use cases of borrowing, lending, exchange, and derivatives form what’s often referred to as DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Popular DApps in this category include UniSwap, SushiSwap, and Compound — and the Bitcoin.com Wallet supports the native tokens for all of those DApps. Recently, NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and SuperRare have become popular DApps. Here, you can buy and sell NFT-based artwork and collectibles, some of which integrate elements of gamification. You can browse through recommended DApps in the Bitcoin.com Wallet app’s Discover tab or find a comprehensive list here.Using WalletConnect to connect to DApps is safe in the sense that it establishes a secure (encrypted) connection, with your approval, between your Bitcoin.com Wallet and the DApps of your choosing, and it does not reveal your private key. In other words, when you connect to a DApp via WalletConnect, it’s impossible for the funds in your wallet to be spent without your approval. That being said, any time you (purposely) send cryptoassets to a smart contract, there are risks. These are outlined here.Bitcoin.com, in line with its vision to support economic freedom, will be rolling out more DApp-related features over the coming months. You can register for notifications here, and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

The CEO of the asset management company says bitcoin is not just an inflation hedge: “I think it’s crossed the chasm to mainstream.”Soros Fund Management, the asset management company founded by billionaire investor George Soros, has invested in bitcoin, the fund’s CEO, Dawn Fitzpatrick, revealed in an interview with Bloomberg, published Tuesday.Fitzpatrick is both the CEO and chief investment officer (CIO) of Soros Fund Management. She is the first person to hold both titles.Discussing inflation, she said, “If you watched gold in September, it was down 5% so I think the fear of the debasing of the U.S. dollar has receded to a degree.” In addition, she noted, “The IMF just came out with kind of reserve currency balances and the U.S. dollar has stopped losing ground.”Nonetheless, bitcoin is trading above $50K. Commenting on the rapid rise in the price of BTC, Fitzpatrick opined:I am not sure bitcoin is only viewed as an inflation hedge here. I think it’s crossed the chasm to mainstream. Cryptocurrencies now have a market cap of over $2 trillion. There’s 200 million users around the world. So, I think this has gone mainstream from our perspective.The CEO of Soros Fund Management further revealed:We own some coins but not a lot, and the coins themselves are less interesting than the use cases of defi [decentralized finance] and things like that.In March, Fitzpatrick said that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) “is a potential threat to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” However, she said the threat “will be temporary,” emphasizing, “I don’t think they’ll be successful in permanently destabilizing bitcoin.”At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $53,982.51 and its market cap is about $1.2 trillion.What do you think about the CEO of Soros Fund Management saying that bitcoin has gone mainstream?

453,JPMorgan: Institutional Investors Dump Gold for Bitcoin Seeing It as Better Inflation Hedge,"Oct 7, 2021","Global investment bank JPMorgan says institutional investors are returning to bitcoin, seeing the cryptocurrency as a better hedge than gold. The firm’s analysts describe three key drivers boosting the price of bitcoin in recent weeks, including assurances that U.S. policymakers will not ban cryptocurrencies.JPMorgan published a research note Thursday stating that institutional investors are returning to bitcoin. Citing the trend of money flowing out of gold into BTC, the firm’s analysts wrote:Institutional investors appear to be returning to bitcoin perhaps seeing it as a better inflation hedge than gold.The analysts explained that there are three key drivers pushing the price of bitcoin from about $40K to about $55K in a short period of time. The price of bitcoin is $53,853.14 at the time of writing based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.The first is “The recent assurances by U.S. policymakers that there is no intention to follow China’s steps towards banning the usage or mining of cryptocurrencies.” Both Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told Congress this week that they had no intention to ban cryptocurrency as China did. The SEC chief said his agency is taking a different approach to China, focusing on investor protection and regulation.The second reason is “The recent rise of the Lightning Network and 2nd layer payments solutions helped by El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption,” JPMorgan detailed. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in early September. The country has bought 700 BTC and President Nayib Bukele claimed that 3 million Salvadorans are already using the government’s bitcoin wallet, Chivo.The third reason is:The re-emergence of inflation concerns among investors has renewed interest in the usage of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.JPMorgan further explained that the trend of funds flowing out of gold into bitcoin has reemerged in recent weeks. In May, the firm saw the opposite trend where funds flowed out of BTC into gold.According to the firm, more than $10 billion has flowed out of gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since the beginning of the year. During the same time period, more than $20 billion has flowed into bitcoin funds.Noting that those flows of funds into bitcoin helped push BTC’s share of the total crypto market to nearly 45% from a low of 41% in mid-September, the analysts concluded:The increase in the share of bitcoin is a healthy development as it is more likely to reflect institutional participation than smaller cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and regulators will “regulate the hell out of it.” His investment bank, however, is currently offering multiple crypto investments to clients.What do you think about JPMorgan’s analysis? Let us know in the comments section below.

454,"Bitcoin ETF Approval Expected by Month's End, Prominent Hedge Fund Puts More Weight Behind BTC","Oct 7, 2021","The price of bitcoin soared past the $55K handle on Wednesday for the first time in four months giving proponents hope the crypto bull run has been re-ignited. Speculators are predicting a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved soon and some believe bitcoin will outperform other crypto assets this month.While 13 digital currencies outperformed bitcoin (BTC) this past week, BTC has been a top performer gathering 34.2% over the last seven days. On Wednesday, statistics indicate that BTC gained more than 7% in value and tapped a daily high of $55,800.One of the reasons behind bitcoin’s price spike is the rumor that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may get the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas discussed his opinion of the possibility on October 2 and shared a screenshot of the odds. Balchunas also mentioned SEC chairman Gary Gensler, calling him “Genz,” and how he likes the futures version of the bitcoin ETFs.“Yes, the SEC has kicked can on bitcoin ETF approval,” Balchunas tweeted. “BUT that is for the physically-backed ones under ’33 Act. The futures ETFs filed under the ’40 Act (which Genz loves) are very much alive and likely on schedule (we think 75% chance approved in Oct).”The ETF analyst Balchunas’ odds are pictured below.In addition to the odds from the ETF analyst, the mobile hedge fund and investment firm backed by a16z, Kevin Durant, Ashton Kutcher, and Will Smith, Titan, revealed that the actively managed crypto fund for Titan clients will be changing positions in the space to put more weight behind bitcoin.“We’ve slimmed our other positions to put our weight behind bitcoin. We believe it’s bitcoin’s time to shine,” Titan said on Wednesday evening (EST). “After a very rocky end to September in the crypto markets, October has kicked off with meaningful gains. Some were surprised that bitcoin held $40K through September, despite an onslaught of bad news.” Titan added:But — as noted in our previous updates — on-chain data continued to show bullish broader accumulation trends by institutional investors and whales, who seemed wholly unfazed in spite of heightened volatility. We’ve now seen bitcoin spike as high as ~$55K this week, but we see more room to run.Titan gives four specific reasons why Titan researchers believe bitcoin’s value will “exponentially grow in October, while other crypto assets may plateau.” Titan’s reasons include:The crypto derivatives exchange Delta Exchange and its CEO Pankaj Balani share a similar view that BTC is expected to outperform other crypto assets. “Bitcoin has spiked up after its seasonal correction in September,” Balani said in a note sent to Bitcoin.com News. “The price action looks very bullish given that there is strength in bitcoin despite weakness in the global macro. Bitcoin has also digested all the negative news that has come out of China in the past few weeks which is a very positive sign.” Balani added:There has been fresh spot buying activity in bitcoin and looking at the price action we expect to see a fresh ATH in the coming weeks. We also expect bitcoin to outperform altcoins and the money to rotate into bitcoin from alts going forward.What do you think about the prediction that the month of October will see bitcoin outperform other crypto assets? Do you think a bitcoin ETF will get approved? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

455,"Cash2Bitcoin: As Bitcoin Greatly Outperforms S&P 500, Bitcoin ATMs Gain in Popularity","Oct 7, 2021","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and after an initial dip, the stock market has performed exceptionally well for such an economically uncertain time. The SPDR S&P 500 electronically traded fund (ETF), which provides a good indicator of the stock market’s overall performance, has increased in value by 32% year-over-year (YoY) and 39% since the beginning of January 2020.While these returns are impressive, the performance of Bitcoin has surpassed expectations and greatly exceeded the performance of the S&P 500. Bitcoin’s value has drastically increased by 554% since the beginning of 2020 and by 352% YoY. As Figure 1 highlights, these are far beyond those of the stock market and most any other asset class. Bitcoin’s price during this time rose from $7,175 and $10,382, respectively, to $46,898.For the past 4 years, Cash2Bitcoin has helped new investors across the United States gain access to this asset by providing physical locations where Bitcoin can be purchased, in the form of ATMs. Ubiquitous access to these ATMs has enabled investors at all levels to reap the benefits of this growing asset.Figure 1: Price change of Bitcoin and SPY ETF between January 1, 2020, and September 7, 2021On account of its marked performance, investing in Bitcoin has greatly rewarded its supporters and many short, medium, and long-term investors have made notable gains in the past two years. Figure 2 illustrates returns for investments made at eight different periods leading up to the present day, September 7, 2021. For instance, if an individual purchased Bitcoin nine months ago and sold it now, they would have made a profit of 145%. Similarly, if they purchased Bitcoin 18 months ago and sold it now, they would have made a profit of 425%.Figure 2: Profit made if Bitcoin were purchased 1-21 months ago and sold on September 7, 2021Excluding the period of six months ago, individuals who purchased Bitcoin at any of these periods made gains averaging 267%. Although the prices decreased approximately six months ago, hence the return of -7% if it was purchased then, the price has been steadily rising and may reach its peak again soon.Even before the pandemic began, Bitcoin started finding its way into the portfolios of retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin’s performance during the past year and a half has created a positive feedback loop, with its price skyrocketing from $7,175 to just above $63,000 at its peak—a price it may very well reach again soon. Cash2Bitcoin is a key enabler of this uptick in the United States, having deployed over 470 Bitcoin/crypto ATMs across the country. Cash2Bitcoin also supports hundreds of other independent operators by providing customer support services, monitoring machines, and purchasing and exchanging Bitcoin on their behalf.Unlike acquiring Bitcoin through online exchanges, using Cash2Bitcoin ATMs requires no more technical savvy than using a traditional ATM. Individuals simply deposit their cash and have Bitcoin directly deposited to their virtual wallets or can print a temporary QR code that can be used to deposit the Bitcoin into a digital wallet later on. This has reduced barriers to entry for retail investors at all socioeconomic levels, and therefore has allowed many more individuals to profit from this investment. Full details on how purchasing Bitcoin at these ATMs works are available on Cash2Bitcoin’s site.As highlighted in the map below, Cash2Bitcoin provides ATMs across the United States and continues to expand its footprint. Its ATMs are located everywhere from small-town gas stations to corner markets in cities such as Dallas, Jacksonville, Detroit, and Indianapolis. The number of ATMs that Cash2Bitcoin installs each month has grown exponentially, mirroring the price increases of the currencies they provide and further bolstering Bitcoin’s value and demand.Figure 3: Cash2Bitcoin’s ATM locations across the United StatesSource: Cash2BitcoinThroughout the pandemic, customers performed an increasing number of transactions at Cash2Bitcoin’s ATMs. The number of transactions performed at its ATMs per month more than doubled from just under 2,000 in January 2020 to approximately 5,200 at its peak in March 2021 and approximately 4,100 in August 2021. Importantly, the rise in the number of transactions per month mirrored the increase in the number of unique customers per month, as highlighted in Figure 4. This suggests that an expanding customer base supported this rise rather than a stagnant but increasingly interested group of individuals.Figure 4: Number of transactions and unique customers per month performed at all Cash2Bitcoin ATMsTo meet this rising customer demand, Cash2Bitcoin quickly expanded its operation. On January 1, 2020, Cash2Bitcoin operated under 100 Bitcoin ATMs. This number will have ballooned to over 470 by the time this paper is published. This rapid expansion has led to a relatively consistent average number of transactions per month per ATM; however, this ratio is likely to increase as internal analysis has shown that even successful ATMs often have slow starts in terms of attracting users after initial placement.Due to the proprietary nature of the data, this paper cannot delve into the specific figures relating to the average number of transactions per month per ATM. Irrespective of whether this ratio continues to rise, a stable number of average customers per month per machine suggests demand exists, at the very least, in untapped markets. This demand has risen, at least in part, because of a positive feedback loop. As the price of Bitcoin rises, it gains the attention of new investors, creating more demand and raising prices further. This type of loop is common for other assets and is commonly seen in the stock market. At times, the price of Bitcoin has decreased and demand has followed suit, but each time the price has returned to then surpassed the previous high. As long as this demand exists, Cash2Bitcoin will continue to expand into new markets. Figure 5 compares the price of Bitcoin with the number of transactions across all of Cash2Bitcoin’s ATMs.Figure 5: Weekly number of transactions at Cash2Bitcoin locations and weekly average price of BitcoinAs highlighted earlier in Figure 2, many individuals who purchased Bitcoin throughout the pandemic earned profits averaging over 200%. Put in more tangible terms, the Table 1 provides examples of potential profits made if users purchased Bitcoin on January 1, 2020, and sold it now.Table 1: Potential profits if Bitcoin was purchased on January 1, 2020, and sold on September 7, 2021Note: “Present value” and “Potential profit” based on price of Bitcoin on Sept. 7, 2021Such profits and the convenience of using physical locations significantly outweigh the nominal ATM fees Cash2Bitcoin charges customers. In essence, these are convenience fees for bringing Bitcoin purchases to the physical world.Investing $5,000 or more in Bitcoin by purchasing it at ATMs is relatively common. Approximately 10% of individuals who obtained Bitcoin through Cash2Bitcoin’s machines purchased a total of $5,000 worth or more during the period under review. Even more importantly, 6% purchased a total of $10,000 or more during this time. People investing higher amounts may be drawn to ATMs because they purchase smaller amounts consistently over time, have a significant amount of cash on hand and prefer to quickly exchange it for a growing asset, or find the registration process for ATMs more convenient than the process for online exchanges.Analysts attribute Bitcoin’s price increase to a wide variety of factors. Particularly during the pandemic, as inflation with many traditional currencies has crept in, investors have sought currencies and assets that cannot increase in supply, thereby dropping in value. Bitcoin, for instance, has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, just as the supply of gold is limited to what can be mined. Furthermore, many companies have begun holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets and/or accepting it as a form of payment, such as Tesla, Newegg, Microsoft, AMC Theatres, and Square. To keep up with this demand, some payment processors, such as Paypal, have announced or already enacted plans to facilitate payments between customers and vendors using Bitcoin.With interest in Bitcoin showing few signs of slowing, many expect the price to continue increasing and passing its previous record of $63,000 because of its uptake by large companies, increased use cases, and the positive feedback loop mentioned above. To keep up with demand, both for the currency itself and ways of acquiring it, Cash2Bitcoin will continue to install ATMs across the country, ultimately making it easier for retail investors, such as yourself, to purchase it. Cash2Bitcoin are not financial advisors and this paper does not constitute financial advice.This is a sponsored post.

456,"IMF Head Says Central Bank Digital Currencies Are Reliable, Hard to Think of Bitcoin as Money","Oct 6, 2021","Digital currencies backed by central banks are the most reliable form of digital money, according to IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva. At the same time, to think of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as money is difficult, believes the chief executive of the international financial institution. Among the members of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 110 countries are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the fund’s chair and managing director Kristalina Georgieva revealed at an event hosted by Bocconi University in Italy. Speaking remotely to the audience, she noted that the key challenge for monetary authorities now is to guarantee the interoperability of these currencies.According to Georgieva, a major consideration is whether state-backed digital currencies can serve as a means of exchange trusted by the public, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Other questions policymakers need to answer are if CBDCs can contribute to domestic economic stability and how they would fit within international regulatory frameworks introduced by organizations like the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).The BIS Innovation Hub is leading several projects to test the use of state-issued digital currencies in international transactions such as a collaboration between the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank Negara Malaysia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the South African Reserve Bank. These also include joint trials conducted by China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and UAE as well as a wholesale CBDC test carried out by Banque de France and the Swiss National Bank.In reference to cooperation between international financial organizations and national monetary authorities regarding CBDCs, Kristalina Georgieva further stated:[It is] very impressive how much the international community, the central banks, institutions like ours are now actively engaged to make sure that in this fast moving world of digitalization, money is a source of confidence and helps the economy function rather than [being] a risk.The head of the IMF emphasized that she views digital currencies issued by central banks as the most reliable form of digital money while remarking she finds it hard to think of cryptocurrencies as money. “De-facto assets” like bitcoin are not backed by assets that hold their value stable and can rise and fall sharply, Georgieva elaborated, insisting:In the history of money, it is difficult to think of them as money.In her address at the Italian academic event, the IMF chief also spoke about Europe’s efforts to deal with challenges caused by the spread of Covid-19. Kristalina Georgieva noted that the Old Continent is now more prepared to avoid another debt crisis such as the one with Greece after the last global financial crisis. However, she stressed that governments need to plan their course carefully as they shift to medium-term fiscal consolidation so they can erase the debt burden related to the pandemic.Do you think the International Monetary Fund will change its position on cryptocurrencies in the future?

Bitcoin is stronger “despite a coordinated global campaign by governments to undermine public understanding of — and support for — cryptocurrency,” he said.Former computer intelligence consultant for the National Security Agency (NSA) and contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Edward Snowden, tweeted about bitcoin Sunday. It references another tweet he made last year that reads, “This is the first time in a while I’ve felt like buying bitcoin.”“Sometimes I think back to this and wonder how many people bought bitcoin then,” Snowden wrote Sunday. “It’s up [about] 10x since, despite a coordinated global campaign by governments to undermine public understanding of — and support for — cryptocurrency. China even banned it, but it just made bitcoin stronger.”The price of bitcoin rose from around $5K when he tweeted on March 13, 2020, to about $50K at the time of writing based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Snowden has long been a supporter of bitcoin, tweeting about the cryptocurrency on multiple occasions.When El Salvador made BTC legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, the privacy activist wrote: “There is now pressure on competing nations to acquire bitcoin … Latecomers may regret hesitating.”When Onlyfans said it would prohibit users from posting sexually explicit content due to mounting pressure from banking partners and payment providers, Snowden tweeted, “Bitcoin fixes this.” Furthermore, when President Joe Biden unveiled a historically large $6 trillion 2022 budget in May, Snowden wrote: “Six trillion dollars? This is good for bitcoin.”What do you think about Edward Snowden’s comments about bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

458,"Bitcoin Will Become Currency in Brazil Soon, According to Federal Deputy Aureo Ribeiro","Oct 5, 2021","Aureo Ribeiro, a federal deputy in Brazil, stated that bitcoin might become a recognized currency in Brazil soon, during an interview with local media. The politician stated that Brazilians may be able to purchase houses, cars, and even fast food at McDonald’s with cryptocurrency in the near future. Bill 2.303/15, which regulates cryptocurrencies, might approve the legal use of the asset, similar to El Salvador.Bitcoin might become a regulated currency for payments in Brazil in the near future, according to statements given by Aureo Ribeiro, a federal deputy. Ribeiro stated that with the future approval of Bill 2.303/15, which regulates cryptocurrencies, new uses would be open for crypto holders, such as buying houses, cars, and even food in restaurants like McDonald’s.These comments are the product of the approval of the so-called Brazilian “Bitcoin Law” for presentation in the Plenary of the Chamber of Deputies, after being stuck in development for years. Ribeiro also stated that, by its design, this law could be a referent for other countries wishing to regulate digital assets, saying its text is “innovative.” In this sense, Ribeiro stressed:We debated a few years there to arrive at a text that recognizes this asset… which will be regulated by a government agency, because we will work with the Central Bank and the CVM, depending on how this asset will be recognized, such as real estate value or currency of daily use.Ribeiro is also very positive about the effect this law is expected to have in protecting citizens from Ponzi schemes in the sector. Brazilians have been especially hit hard with these scams, with the authorities having to act against the promoters of these alleged Ponzi schemes several times this year. However, cryptocurrencies in Brazil are still a gray area, and authorities are limited in the scope of their ability to control these companies. Ribeiro stressed that with this law, the government wants to:Separate the wheat from the chaff, create regulations so that you can trade, know where you are buying, know who you are dealing with.To conclude, the federal deputy said that the law project had support in the government, and it has also been discussed with Arthur Lira, president of the Chamber of Deputies. To Ribeiro, is just a matter of time for the law to be approved.What do you think about a “Bitcoin law” in Brazil? Tell us in the comments section below.

In comparison, many have also pointed out that fiat currencies also have no intrinsic value. A report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis states: “State monopoly currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Swiss franc, have no intrinsic value either.”Dimon was further asked whether governments should regulate bitcoin. “Yes,” he exclaimed, adding: “They have to. You can’t regulate everything a bank does in terms of moving money and not regulate what you would call money.” The JPMorgan executive elaborated:You can call it a security or an asset or something like that, but if people are using it for tax avoidance and sex trafficking and ransomware, it’s going to be regulated, whether you like it or not. So it’s not a moral statement. It’s a factual statement.Dimon has long been a bitcoin and crypto skeptic. He called BTC a fraud back in September 2017 but later regretted making the statement. In May, he advised people to “stay away” from cryptocurrency.While stating that he himself did not care about bitcoin, Dimon admitted that JPMorgan clients are interested. In July, the bank said that lots of its clients saw cryptocurrency as an asset class and they wanted to invest in it. By August, JPMorgan was offering six cryptocurrency investment funds to clients.What do you think about JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

460,"Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Continues to Rise: 37% More Difficult to Mine BTC Than 3 Months Ago, Difficulty Nears 20 Trillion","Oct 4, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has been climbing steadily over the last three months and rose more than 40% after the network’s hashpower was below 90 exahash per second (EH/s) on July 5. The trend has led to a consecutive run of five bitcoin mining difficulty accruals with another increase expected during the next transition.The overall Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate has been slowly but steadily rising higher during the last 90 days. The network’s current processing power is coasting along at 130 EH/s, and three months ago the hashpower was 40% lower than today.In the last 24 hours, Antpool has been the top mining pool dedicating hashrate to the BTC network with 29.7 EH/s or 20.47% of the global hashrate. Antpool is followed by F2pool with 23.58 EH/s or 16.2% of BTC’s overall hashrate, and Pooling captures 13.2% of the network or 19.2 EH/s.Other top pools dedicating vast amounts of hashrate to the BTC network include operations such as Viabtc, Foundry USA, and Btc.com, respectively. While Bitcoin.com News reported that the quantity of unknown hashrate had disappeared during the last hashrate report, a small fraction of stealth mining has recently returned. 1.86 EH/s or 1.28% of the global hashrate currently belongs to unknown mining entities.As BTC’s hashrate has increased and mining pools have been shuffling around, the network’s mining difficulty is expected to increase for the sixth time in a row. At the time of writing, it is expected to increase by 2.99% to 19.57 trillion, getting awfully close to the 20 trillion mark. Currently, BTC’s mining difficulty is 19.00 trillion. A 2.99% increase will mean it will be 37% more difficult to mine bitcoin than it was on July 30.The upcoming increase is similar in size to the difficulty increase two weeks ago which was roughly 3.16%. The biggest jump in the consecutive run of difficulty rises was on August 25, at block height 697,536, when the difficulty jumped approximately 13.24%. The consecutive run of mining difficulty increases follows the run of five consecutive difficulty adjustment algorithm decreases.What do you think about Bitcoin’s hashrate this week and the upcoming mining difficulty increase?

461,Canadian Bitcoin Mine Operator Facing $7 Million Fine for Setting Up Power Plants Without Permission,"Oct 4, 2021","Link Global, a bitcoin mine operator in Canada, is facing a fine of up to $7 million for installing power plants to run its miners without government permission. The company installed several power plants without following legal procedures and alleges that, if the penalty is enforced, it will constitute a fatal blow to its finances.A bitcoin mine operator in Canada could be fined up to $7 million after setting up a mining operation with power plants without having permission from the government in Alberta. Link Global started operations in Alberta by setting up four gas generators at a site in Sturgeon County, near Edmonton, and also another mine in Kirkwall. According to reports, none of these sites complied with the rule of the Alberta Utilities Commission.The case was put in motion when neighboring communities complained about the noise the sites created. The authorities notified the company it did not comply with their requirements earlier this year, on August 25, and stopped operations of the two mining sites involved. Each of the sites had been operating for more than a year in those conditions.The Alberta Utilities Commission divides the penalties proposed into two major parts: the first one has to do with the benefits obtained for generating power. The institution alleges that damages in this regard amount to two million dollars. The other part has to do with the benefits obtained for mining bitcoin using this power. This amount goes up to five million, according to estimations.Link Global is contesting the fines, explaining that they are not based on the actual financial reports of the company. It is now relocating these bitcoin mining operations to other locations, to comply with current regulations. Stephen Jenkins, CEO of Link Global, declared to local media:Link has followed the orders issued by the AUC and believes that what enforcement staff is proposing is punitive … I apologize to our shareholders who do not deserve this. We will work tirelessly to ensure the outcome is positive.The company and its shareholders, which are in the process of building two new bitcoin mines in the region, will have to wait till October 14, where their destiny and the definitive fine will be decided in a hearing.What do you think of Alberta’s regulation on power plants?

462,Virgin Galactic Chairman Chamath Palihapitiya Says Bitcoin Has Replaced Gold,"Oct 3, 2021","Virgin Galactic’s chairman and CEO of Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, says bitcoin has effectively replaced gold. Having predicted that the price of the cryptocurrency would hit $200,000, the executive said bitcoin’s “market cap is just going to grow.”Virgin Galactic Chairman Chamath Palihapitiya talked about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC at the Delivering Alpha Conference last week. The billionaire executive is also the founder and CEO of Social Capital.Earlier this year, Palihapitiya predicted that the price of BTC would hit $200K in about five years. Commenting on his price prediction, he said Wednesday:It’s very hard for me sitting here to give you a price prediction, but I can pretty confidently say that bitcoin, I think, has effectively replaced gold. And it will continue to do so. And so that market cap is just going to grow.The price of bitcoin is $48,093 and its market cap is $905.8 billion at the time of writing, based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Palihapitiya has long been a supporter of bitcoin. He revealed last year: “In 2013, I bought a lot and at one point I think I had almost 5% of all the bitcoins. My basis is about 80 bucks a coin. I’ve never bought more.”The billionaire investor was quoted last week as saying: “I haven’t put a lot of money outside of bitcoin obviously. You know, tens of millions, hundreds of millions — like small capital right now. It could get very big. But irrespective of what I do, I will say we all need to pay attention to it because I think the implications are enormous.”He explained that cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (defi) are part of Web 3.0 while Google and Facebook dominated the first two versions of the internet. The next stage of the evolution of the internet “is rebuilding all of that stuff without an obvious leader,” the Virgin Galactic chairman said. “It’s completely headless. It’s entirely peer-to-peer. And I think that that’s both scary and exhilarating.”Palihapitiya also reportedly commented on whether regulators could kill bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Some people, such as Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, have warned that governments could kill cryptocurrency if it becomes really successful. However, many others said it is not possible to kill crypto, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who recently suggested that governments should “do nothing” to regulate or control crypto.Palihapitiya opined:I think it’s very hard to kill [bitcoin]. Technically, it’s very difficult. Just the way that it’s architected, it is the most profound iteration of the internet that we’ve seen.Do you agree with Chamath Palihapitiya that bitcoin has replaced gold?

463,October's Historical Bitcoin Price Trend Extends Hope for a Renewed Bull Run to End the Year,"Oct 2, 2021","Bitcoin logged price losses once again for the crypto asset’s fifth consecutive September in its lifetime, but as soon as the month ended, billions of dollars came back into the crypto economy. Metrics show that while September has consistently been a bad month for bitcoin, October, on the other hand, has traditionally been a good month for bitcoin since 2013.In 2020, the price of bitcoin (BTC) closed the month of September at around $10,750 per unit but the following month, BTC spiked 25% to roughly $13,450 per unit. This year, September has been dreary price-wise, and many crypto proponents have asked to be woken up when “September ends.” On September 26, Civic co-founder Vinny Lingham wrote: “This feels like September 2017 again… Who remembers what happened next?”On October 1, 2021, BTC surged from $43,500 per unit to Friday’s high of $48,500 per BTC. That’s an increase of around 11.49% and the spike happened very quickly at around 3 a.m. (EST) in the morning.Prior to July and August, BTC saw roughly three months of negative returns, and in September prices once again slipped into the negative range. The downward drop was blamed on China cracking down on bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency exchange for the seventh time since 2013.Bitcoin also saw losses on the day El Salvador adopted the cryptocurrency as legal tender and furthermore, BTC slid when the Evergrande real estate crisis shook the global economy.All of these dips took place after BTC reached a high of $52K before September started and crypto markets looked seemingly bullish at the time. While September prices were not so hot, metrics from a recent Cryptocompare report showed that institutional products tied to BTC saw some upside.“Bitcoin-based products saw the highest level of inflows out of any asset, averaging $31.2 million per week,” Cryptocompare’s research details. “There could be upside going into the last quarter of 2021.”While BTC has neared the $50K zone on October 1, the crypto asset has some resistance to fight at the $50K handle and even more so when it reaches $53K. Moreover, as bitcoin (BTC) has seen profitable increases in value during the month of October since 2013, the months of November and December have seen much larger spikes in value.What do you think about bitcoin’s performance during the month of September and the trends tied to bitcoin’s October performances during the last few years?

In fact, 59.4% of the more bullish respondents are expecting the leading crypto to rise to as much as $100,000.These are the findings of Luno’s Q3 Customer Sentiment Survey that was conducted between August 20 and September 20. A total of 1,870 customers of Luno cryptocurrency exchange from South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the U.K. participated in the study.Aside from bitcoin, study participants were also asked to share their thoughts about the prospects of altcoins like ETH, XRP and BCH. As the study findings suggest, many of the respondents across the four countries are similarly bullish on altcoins as well.However, it would appear that Luno customers in the U.K. and Malaysia are more bullish on such cryptos as ETH than their counterparts in South Africa. The exchange’s blog explains:“While 64.5% of our South African users are most optimistic about bitcoin, ethereum is second at 55.4%, followed by XRP (28.6%), bitcoin cash (25.9%) and litecoin (17.8%). Meanwhile, although Malaysian and British customers both share strong enthusiasm for bitcoin, they’re most optimistic about ethereum. Nearly 70% of Malaysian customers are feeling optimism for ethereum, with 75% of investors in Great Britain sharing the same sentiment.”Concerning customers’ understanding of cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment, the study found that 38% of respondents intend to hodl their investments. While 28% of the respondents do consider themselves day traders, the blog still concludes that “the idea of bitcoin as something you’re in the long haul for seems to have certainly taken root.”What are your thoughts on the findings of this study? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

465,SEC Delays 4 Bitcoin ETF Deadlines — Regulator 'Finds It Appropriate to Designate a Longer Period of Time',"Oct 1, 2021","On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed four bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) deadlines for another 45 days. The regulator notes that the entity needs more time to decide on the ETF applications.The Kryptoin Bitcoin ETF, Global X Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund, and Wisdomtree Bitcoin Trust have all been delayed according to the latest SEC filing. ​​”The 45th day after publication of the notice for this proposed rule change is October 24, 2021,” the U.S. regulator’s filing details. While there’s been a large quantity of bitcoin ETFs filed in the U.S., the SEC has yet to approve any of them.The SEC filing was published by the regulator’s assistant secretary J. Matthew DeLesDernier. “The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and any comments,” DeLesDernier details. The regulator adds:Accordingly, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, Commission designates December 8, 2021, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1 (File No. SR-Nasdaq-2021-066).Many speculators thought that a bitcoin ETF would be approved this year. Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas told the public on Twitter that he believed an ETF would be approved by the end of October. Balchunas emphasized that the Proshares Bitcoin ETF may be the likely candidate.“New note out today from James Seyffart [on] how the Ether ETF withdrawals add to the likelihood that a bitcoin futures ETF will be launched by end of October with Proshares as favorite, [although] it could (and arguably should) be a group to avoid first-mover advantage,” Balchunas said. The Bloomberg analyst added:We think ether withdrawal shows SEC has a nose in this [right now] and is in [regular] contact with issuers which should mean any kinks ironed out so that they can launch 75 days after filing. Further, ProFunds’ bitcoin MF was launched 77 days after filing. These are virtually [the] same thing.As far as the four bitcoin ETFs that were delayed on Friday, they will have to wait a few more weeks patiently. “The Commission shall either approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved,” the SEC filing concludes.What do you think about the SEC delaying four bitcoin ETFs on Friday?

467,SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Looks Forward to Review of Bitcoin Futures ETF Filings,"Sep 30, 2021","The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, explains that some laws provide “significant investor protections” for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including those seeking to invest in bitcoin futures. He looks forward to seeing the SEC’s review of such filings.SEC Chairman Gary Gensler talked about crypto regulation and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the Financial Times’ Future of Asset Management North America conference Wednesday.In prepared remarks, he discussed “investment vehicles providing exposure to crypto assets,” noting that “Earlier this year, a number of open-end mutual funds launched that invested in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)-traded bitcoin futures.”Gensler added, “Subsequently, we’ve started to see filings under the Investment Company Act [’40 Act] with regard to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seeking to invest in CME-traded bitcoin futures,” elaborating:When combined with the other federal securities laws, the ’40 Act provides significant investor protections for mutual funds and ETFs. I look forward to staff’s review of such filings.In August, Gensler similarly said he looked forward to the staff’s review of ETF filings, “particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures.”He also emphasized at the conference on wednesday the need for investor protection. “This crypto space is now certainly of a size that without those investor protections of banking, insurance, securities laws, [and] market oversight, I do think somebody is going to get hurt. A lot of people are likely to get hurt,” Gensler was quoted by the Financial Times as saying.The chairman has been urging crypto companies to come in and discuss whether they need to register with the SEC. Without naming specific platforms, he said, some companies have “said things publicly about some of those conversations.” Recently, Coinbase took to Twitter to talk about its lending product that the SEC threatened to sue over if it is launched. CEO Brian Armstrong called the securities watchdog’s behavior “sketchy.” The Nasdaq-listed company subsequently abandoned its plan to launch the product.Gensler said Wednesday:There are going to be times that people come in and we say: ‘Register.’ It’s not going to be everybody comes in and says: ‘Can you please tell us we are not a security.’Do you think the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF or bitcoin futures ETF this year?

It creates an incredible opportunity for America.Suarez commented on China’s crackdown this week: “China banning bitcoin is a massive mistake with impacts that will be felt for generations. Their loss is our gain and America can and will lead the future by providing a clean power home for bitcoin miners and all who are building on/with/for bitcoin.”The mayor of Miami is not the only politician who sees China’s crackdown on crypto as an opportunity for the U.S. “China’s authoritarian crackdown on crypto, including bitcoin, is a big opportunity for the U.S. It’s also a reminder of our huge structural advantage over China,” said Senator Pat Toomey. Congressman Patrick McHenry said, “China’s decision to restrict access presents a perfect opportunity for American leadership on cryptocurrency.”Mayor Suarez said earlier this week that he has been actively trying to convince cryptocurrency miners that South Florida offers great opportunities for mining, including clean energy options, such as nuclear, solar, and hydroelectric.He confirmed that he has spoken to the CEO of Florida Power & Light, Eric Silagy, about attracting crypto businesses to the area. He tweeted in May that the City of Miami “can mine bitcoin with clean nuclear energy provided by Florida Power & Light,” emphasizing:We want to be the crypto mining capital of the world and know it can be done sustainably and incorporate solar.Do you think that China’s crypto crackdown is an opportunity for the U.S. to lead in the area of crypto and crypto mining?

470,Salvadoran President Shares Video of Volcano-Powered Bitcoin Mining Facility,"Sep 29, 2021","On Tuesday, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele shared a video of a bitcoin mine operating adjacent to a volcano. Bukele discussed the volcano-powered bitcoin mining on June 9 when he talked about the “95MW of 100% clean, 0 emissions geothermal energy from our volcanos.”The president of El Salvador shared a video via the social media platform Twitter that said “First steps,” as the film shows ASIC bitcoin mining rigs being installed at a geothermal energy plant. The video shows containers that are emblazoned with the Salvadoran government logos and a large quantity of ASIC mining devices. The video has been viewed around 2 million times on Twitter, and Bukele’s video tweet has over 50K likes and over 12,000 retweets.First steps…🌋#Bitcoin🇸🇻 pic.twitter.com/duhHvmEnym— Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) September 28, 2021While many bitcoin proponents said the mining facility was “impressive,” a few Salvadoran citizens complained about the use of energy. “So, there are centers to produce more energy, but to mine bitcoin,” one individual asked the Salvadoran president. “People who have been waiting for electricity for more than 30 years. Not that you would help those most in need? Hypocrite,” the person added.A lot of people gave the woman flak for asking Bukele that question, but a number of people stuck up for her. “She just wonders, like any normal person,” another individual replied in Nayib Bukele’s tweet thread. “Why is there money to set up power plants for [bitcoin] mining and there is no money to supply the entire population. Before insulting people, make an argument,” the person added. Besides the introduction to volcano-powered bitcoin mining this past June, Bukele also discussed the subject in greater detail on an episode of “What Bitcoin Did.”The Salvadoran president told the host Peter McCormack about how “El Salvador has not been the country that’s recognised to be the first in innovation,” but he asked, “Why not this time?”While Bukele stressed during his interview that geothermal energy was “a very, very clean source of energy” and that it has “almost no downsides,” the Salvadoran president did not go over the subject of specific Salvadorans not having access to electricity. “Currently, the electrification index is 83.4%” in El Salvador according to the latest statistics. Major urban areas in El Salvador have around 97% access to electricity, while ruralized regions in the country today show an electrification index estimate of around 72%.El Salvador is the largest producer of geothermal energy in Central America and in July, the country suffered from a massive power outage. The Regional Operator Entity (EOR) based in El Salvador told the press that they witnessed a “load loss of 2,300 megawatts.”The power outage in El Salvador and other regions in Central America cost around $18.2 million from failures. “The demand we had at that time was around 8,300 megawatts in the Central American region. We have lost 30% of the electrical power load,” the EOR director, René González, told reporters.When discussing the volcano bitcoin mining experiment with Peter McCormack, Bukele emphasized that the project will be costly. “It’s going to cost $480 million, so that’s going to be a legacy for the country because we are building infrastructure paid by bitcoin,” Bukele said in his interview. Alongside this, demand for electricity in El Salvador is expected to grow annually at a rate of 5% year-over-year.What do you think about the ‘first steps’ volcano-powered bitcoin mine video shared by Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele?

471,"23,250 'Sleeping Bitcoins' Spent in 2021: This Year Old School Miners Moved $1 Billion in BTC From 2010-2013","Sep 28, 2021","On Bitcoin’s 12th anniversary, a mystery miner from the early days spent 1,000 decade-old bitcoins that were mined in 2010. The strange miner was not the only entity that spent 2010 BTC block rewards during the last nine months, but this miner returned on a few occasions to spend strings of ten-year-old block rewards. As the end of 2021 nears, 152 blocks with 7,600 bitcoin worth $319 million today and minted in 2010 have been spent this year after sitting idle for over a decade.**Editor’s note: This article was updated at 12:40 p.m. (EST) on Sept. 28, 2021, to include commentary from the creator of the blockchain parser, in order to explain the parser’s definition so-called ‘sleeping bitcoins.’ During the last 12 years bitcoins have been lost by a great number of people under different circumstances, and it’s likely these coins will never return to circulation. Then there’s another group of bitcoins the community calls ‘sleeping bitcoins’ or ‘zombie bitcoins’ because they have been sitting idle since the day they were created.At some point, if the owner decides to spend the bitcoin, the ‘sleeping bitcoins’ wake from slumber after a number of years. Last year and this year, Bitcoin.com News has been monitoring old school block rewards that get spent years later, after discovering an extraordinary 2010 whale.Following the spend on the 12th anniversary of Bitcoin (January 3, 2021), the mystery miner appeared a few times during the year to spend strings of 20 block rewards from 2010. Block spends from 2010 are not common, and each block reward contains 50 BTC as the first block reward halving did not happen until November 28, 2012.The last time this specific miner from 2010 appeared was on June 9, 2021. This year they spent 20 block reward strings on January 3, 2021 (Bitcoin’s 12th anniversary), January 10, 2021, January 25, 2021, February 28, 2021, March 23, 2021, and June 9, 2021.That’s a total of 120 blocks, or 6,000 bitcoin, worth $252 million spent by what we assume is a single mining entity from 2010. In fact, we can say that the entity spent 78.94% of all the 2010 blocks spent this year (152 total). Because of this whale’s spends, the 2010 block reward spends in 2021 outpaced 2011 and 2012 block reward spends.In 2021, there were approximately 85 block rewards from 2011 transferred from the original address. That’s 4,250 bitcoins total worth $178 million using today’s exchange rates. January and February 2021 saw the most 2011 blocks transferred this year.Statistics from btcparser.com show that there were more 2011 blocks spent this year than the quantity of 2012 blocks. The aggregate total of 2012 block rewards moved in 2021 is currently 63 block rewards. Of the block rewards in the list of 2012 blocks, all of them were pre-halving minted which means they were issued before November 28, 2012.63 block rewards with 50 BTC each is approximately 3,150 BTC or $132 million dollars’ worth at the time of writing. The number of 2013 blocks transferred in 2021 exceeded all of the 2010, 2011, and 2012 block reward spends this year.So far there have been 330 block rewards from 2013 spent during the course of 2021. That’s 30 more blocks than the 2010, 2011, and 2012 spends combined. However, because the 2013 blocks were spent after the first halving in November 2012, the transfers only moved 8,250 BTC this year ($347M).That’s because miners in 2013 got 25 BTC instead of the 50 BTC reward that was given prior to the halving. All of the 2010, 2011, and 2012 spends combined (300 blocks) adds up to 15,000 BTC ($630M). Between block rewards moved from 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, an aggregate total of 630 block rewards was spent with 23,259 BTC worth $977 million today.Crypto proponents have no idea who these miners are but they certainly mined a great quantity of bitcoin in the early days. It’s worth noting that the terms “spent” or “spend” in this article, do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party for fiat or another crypto asset.For this article, using Btcparser.com we parsed 21,519 addresses from 2009, 12,396 addresses from 2010, 3,598 addresses from 2011, 2,193 addresses from 2012, and 5,214 addresses from 2013. From a visual perspective, in this report we leveraged “The (Not) ‘Satoshi’s Bags’ Tracker” located on theholyroger.com. No block rewards from 2009 were spent in 2021 and the last time a 2009 block was moved was on May 20, 2020, when an entity spent a coinbase reward that was minted on February 9, 2009.Speaking with the creator of Btcparser.com, he said that it was worth mentioning that sleeping wallets are not all alike. “For instance,” he said. “Whalealert thinks that every wallet that hasn’t made any outgoing transaction for the last few years is a sleeping one. In my opinion, those are not truly sleeping ones. Btcparser monitors only wallets that have never made any outgoing transfer. Thus we don’t know whenever someone has access to those bitcoins (knows the private key), so we call them virgins.” The blockchain parser’s creator added:Every time the wallet loses its virginity, Btcparser removes it from the monitoring lists. So it might be that some wallets had 50 BTC, but moved only one. Our parser sends messages about that, it shows how much has been transferred, how much remained on balance and that’s it, this wallet won’t be monitored in the future.What do you think about the $977 million in bitcoin moved from 2010-2013 block rewards in 2021?

472,"JPMorgan Boss Jamie Dimon: 'If You Borrow Money to Buy Bitcoin, You’re a Fool'","Sep 28, 2021","Jamie Dimon, the CEO of one of the biggest financial institutions of the world, JPMorgan, has once again let the world know about his stance on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Dimon stated that whoever borrowed money to purchase bitcoin was, in his opinion, a “fool.” However, his personal opinion has not clashed with the fact that JPMorgan is now offering access to six cryptocurrency funds for its customers and even created its own digital ledger token for payments, called JPM Coin.JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon blasted crypto and bitcoin yet again. The JPMorgan executive argued about the real value of cryptocurrencies and his take on the cryptocurrency world in an interview with the Times of India last week. Dimon stated that the latest bull market in cryptocurrencies was created by a lot of liquidity in the system, which then leads to speculation. Dimon declared:I am not a buyer of bitcoin. I think if you borrow money to buy bitcoin, you’re a fool.However, Dimon also acknowledged there is the possibility that the cryptocurrency sector could increase its value tenfold in the next years.Dimon was also asked about how he believes regulations will affect cryptocurrencies in the future. While he stressed bitcoin was not its main interest, Dimon did state that he believes governments will regulate bitcoin at some point in time. He explained:It is going to be regulated. Governments regulate just about everything. I don’t know if it’s an asset. I don’t know if it’s foreign exchange. I don’t know if it’s a currency. I don’t know if it’s the securities law. But they’re going to do it.However, the personal opinions of Dimon about the validity of cryptocurrency and the coming regulation of the cryptocurrency market have not affected JPMorgan’s business moves into crypto. In fact, the company is now more open to cryptocurrencies than it was two or three years ago. In August, the firm informed they would allow its customers to access six cryptocurrency-based investment funds (Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Classic Trust, and the Osprey Bitcoin Trust).Also, the company has dipped its toes when it comes to digital currencies. In October 2020, JPMorgan announced the creation of “JPM Coin,” a network that would allow its customers to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology.What do you think about Jamie Dimon’s remarks about bitcoin? tell us in the comments section below.

473,"Northern Data AG Acquires Bitcoin Miner Bitfield — 33,000 Miners Gained in Stock-for-Stock Deal","Sep 27, 2021","On Monday, the high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure provider and bitcoin mining firm Northern Data AG announced the acquisition of the bitcoin mining operation Bitfield N.V. in a stock-for-stock deal. Northern Data says the company will obtain 33,000 of the latest generation ASIC bitcoin miners from the arrangement. The Bitcoin network hashrate is hovering just above the 140 exahash per second (EH/s) handle at the time of writing. Bitcoin mining has become incredibly competitive and operations are attempting to be more energy efficient. In 2021, there’s been a number of orders and acquisitions of thousands of ASIC bitcoin miners. On September 27, the HPC infrastructure provider and bitcoin mining company Northern Data AG announced the acquisition of the operation Bitfield.The acquisition will allow Northern Data to obtain 33,000 ASIC bitcoin miners via the deal. “Northern Data will acquire an equity interest of up to 100% (but not less than 86%) in Bitfield N.V. for a total enterprise value of up to approximately EUR 400 million and has signed binding purchase agreements with the major shareholders today,” the company announced.Northern Data will gain immediate access to Bitfield’s deployable ASIC mining rigs and current hardware including “over 6,600 high-performance ASIC miners already in operation.”“Commissioning schedule for deployment of another already available 26,000 brand-new miners, primarily at sites in North America, is expected to be completed by end of Q1 2022,” Northern Data details.The transaction between both parties will be a “stock-for-stock transaction involving the issuance of up to 5.1 million shares in Northern Data AG.” All of the bitcoin mining sites are “primarily” located “in Canada and the U.S.A.,” the announcement on Monday details. The company plans to “increase in the number of ASIC miners and GPU server systems” in the future.“The takeover of Bitfield is an important pillar of our scalable growth strategy,” Aroosh Thillainathan, the founder and CEO of Northern Data AG said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “With this acquisition, we add bitcoin mining to our three existing businesses – bitcoin hosting and services, altcoin mining and cloud computing – and achieve an even greater increase in value, not least of all because of the trend in mining profitability.”What do you think about Northern Data AG acquiring the bitcoin mining firm Bitfield?

474,'Who Holds All the Bitcoin' List Debunked — Without Cryptographic Proof No BTC Ownership Claim Holds Water,"Sep 27, 2021","A web portal that displays a list of alleged owners of all the bitcoin in the world has been shared a great deal since China cracked down on crypto trading last week. The web portal claims that the Chinese government owns 194,775 bitcoin that reportedly stem from the Plustoken crypto scam. The problem with the list’s sources is that the ownership verification is highly inconclusive and doesn’t offer much of anything aside from speculation.Ever since China made a few statements concerning citizens dealing with cryptocurrency via offshore exchanges and explaining that the process is illegal, a web page with a list called “Who Holds All The Bitcoin?” has been shared all over social media and cryptocurrency forums.The reason people share it is because they speculate that China is banning bitcoin, while at the same time hoarding 194,775 bitcoins from the Plustoken crypto scam. The list of who owns all the bitcoin also provides a link to sources, and the China source stems from an article published by theblockcrypto.com on November 27, 2020.The source the website uses is an article written by Wolfie Zhao and the editorial is called “Chinese police have seized $4.2 billion cryptos from Plustoken Ponzi crackdown.” The article also contains a court judgment order which explains the case details and lists the conspirators involved.While the article and the judgment order note that the Chinese government did seize various quantities of bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and other tokens, it does not necessarily mean that the Chinese government still holds these crypto assets. There is no hard evidence that the Chinese government holds approximately 194,775 BTC today.The Chinese government would have to prove ownership, and it won’t, and there’s no way of telling whether or not the nation-state sold the assets. It may be possible for blockchain surveillance trackers (blockchain parsers) to at least get a glimpse at whether or not it is even worth pondering. The Chinese government would have to either make a public display and move the coins so the world can see or prove ownership of the funds by using the private key and signature verification.If the Chinese government source is considered legitimate, then people could also assume that Bulgaria owns 213,519 bitcoin. There are plenty of articles regarding the mystery behind the Bulgarian government seizing these coins, but to this day, it is still debatable as to whether or not they are still owned by Bulgaria.Evidence shows it is very likely that Bulgaria auctioned the 200K BTC stash, yet some still believe it is owned by the Bulgarian government. It is also assumed that the government in Ukraine owns 46,351 bitcoin but that figure only comes from public disclosure forms that derive from Ukrainian civil servants.There is no way of verifying whether or not the Chinese government or Bulgarian government still owns any of these bitcoins that were seized from criminal actions. Again, China or Bulgaria would have to prove ownership in a public manner or prove they could move these funds. The countries could sign a message tied to a specific address that held the said quantity of bitcoin, but no government would do this.Some of the sources on the list of who owns all the bitcoin derive from tweets and other articles tied to the likes of Tim Draper and Michael Saylor. Unless these individuals prove ownership by moving the said quantities of bitcoin or they sign a message tied to the crypto asset’s private key, a list of these people with approximate bitcoin holdings is meaningless.Ownership and proving true proof of reserves is quite easy in the world of bitcoin with a private key and signature. Someday, proof of reserves in bitcoin, by signature, will likely be relied on more heavily as the years transpire, because you can’t take a government’s word for it or some individual on social media saying they own thousands of bitcoin. Bitcoin proponent Nic Carter discusses the importance of proof of reserves in an editorial that highlights:Proof of Reserves + Proof of Liability = Proof of SolvencyIn the introduction to the proof of reserves subject, Carter notes that “if there’s a single thing I could do to better this industry, it would be to convince every custodial service provider in the cryptocurrency space to adopt a routine Proof of Reserve program.” Proof of reserves can be done with bitcoin (and other crypto assets) by pretty much any individual or organization that exists today. Without proof of reserves, everything else is mere speculation, hearsay, and unverified evidence.This would include every crypto custodian that doesn’t deploy a proof of reserve method or a claimant that simply says they own a quantity of bitcoin. Just as we would not accept an individual that claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto without verified cryptographic proof, the same can be said about these lists of so-called bitcoin owners. Fact is, without cryptographic proof, every ‘who owns bitcoin’ list can be called into question, and dismissed as mere speculation.What do you think about lists of bitcoin owners claiming to show specific ownership and approximate quantities of bitcoin owned by individuals or organizations?

475,US Government Seizes Trezor Wallet With $6.3 Million in Bitcoin From Gift Card Fraud Case,"Sep 27, 2021","On September 22, 2021, a U.S. district judge from San Antonio, Texas, granted a summary judgment on the civil forfeiture of 147 bitcoin worth $6.3 million held on a Trezor hardware wallet. According to the court filing, the crypto assets stemmed from a Target gift card fraud incident that started in 2016.The Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division Court has been dealing with a case that involved gift card fraud and bitcoins. According to the court filing, an American named Jaymes Allen Clark worked at the retail chain Target as an Executive Team Leader of Assets Protection in San Antonio, Texas. Allegedly, Clark utilized his Target credentials to access Target’s gift card database and he reportedly obtained recently activated gift cards. After Clark detected newly activated cards, he took screenshots of the gift card account information.The filing then claims Clark shared the gift card info with co-conspirators who then leveraged the accounts to purchase iTunes cards and “clean” Target cards. The U.S. prosecutors then claim that Clark was paid in bitcoin and at first he leveraged a Mycelium wallet. The bitcoins were then transferred to a Trezor hardware wallet which is referred to in the summary judgment as a “key fob one.”“Clark had a Trezor wallet (key fob one) with him when he was arrested,” the filing notes. “Following his arrest, Clark was detained at the GEO detention facility in San Antonio, Texas. On September 21, 2017, Clark called his wife from GEO. At the beginning of each call originating from GEO, a recorded message advises that phone calls are recorded. During the call, Clark asked his wife if she had received a key fob from the Secret Service Agents and told her that she could keep it or send the fob to his friend Matt Baker (‘Baker’) in Portland.”The judgment adds:Clark then told his wife the passcode to key fob one and said she could tell Baker the passcode too. Clark’s wife then sent the fob to Baker. The recordings of Clark’s calls from GEO were turned over to the agents involved in the case.In the court judgment, Clark contends his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when he accessed the Trezor via the phone call arrangement with his wife from GEO. “Because claimants concede that key fob one was not illegally seized and because neither claimant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in Clark’s personal calls from GEO, the court denies the motion insofar as it seeks to suppress the search of key fob one,” the Texas district judge details.Additionally, other “key fobs” are mentioned as the government confiscated 187.5 ethereum (ETH) and 76 bitcoin cash (BCH) from “key fob three,” and a $120,000 cashier’s check was forfeited. “Upon the evidence presented, the Court finds the Government has met its burden, by the presentation of circumstantial evidence, that 147.18 Bitcoin constitutes proceeds traceable to Clark’s conspiracy,” the order notes.The court filing also mentions that Clark and his co-conspirators did most of their business communications via Whatsapp’s instant messenger. In an October 19, 2016 Whatsapp conversation with a co-conspirator, Clark allegedly stated: “I’m really excited we’re going to make a nice fat bitcoin wallet,” and “we found an amazing scheme.” Twelve days later on Halloween, Clark reportedly wrote: “We’re going to work our asses off but man we will mint some [bitcoin].”What do you think about the government seizing 147 bitcoin?

The rodent, called Mr. Goxx, uses a device called the “goxx box,” to give signals and make purchases in front of the live streaming audience that follows him. Mr. Goxx has achieved an impressive current score of +24% and even got to +50% before the latest crypto selloff.A cryptocurrency-trading hamster that streams trading signals through Twitch has been on a roll since June, outperforming fellow human traders and Bitcoin, with impressive gains of 24% over its starting portfolio. The rodent, called Mr. Goxx, uses a simple system built on top of an infrastructure called the goxx box, that allows him to pick a cryptocurrency and send a signal to the traders.The system (devised by Mr. Goxx’s human caretaker) uses a hamster wheel to pick a cryptocurrency, and two tubes which the cute trader crawls through then indicate if the selected cryptocurrency must then be bought or sold. The cryptocurrency portfolio of Mr. Goxx includes tron, xrp, cardano, and ether, among 30 other cryptocurrencies. Its portfolio started with $390 back in June and has increased to $498. Also, Mr. Goxx uses Twitter to report his portfolio movements, informing fans about the sales and performance of every trading session that Mr. Goxx engages in via his “office.”The trading hamster has an audience of more than 3K followers on Twitch, being one of the cryptocurrency-related channels that stands out in a gaming-dominated platform. Mr. Goxx reached peak earnings before the recent cryptocurrency selloff when he attained more than 50% of his initial portfolio.However, even with all its positive returns, Mr. Goxx’s anonymous caretaker has still not gained the funds to pay for the initial investment that built the goxx box. The caretaker told Protos in an interview that:Mr. Goxx is happy to see that some of his investments finally pay off.Mr. Goxx has also shown an interesting preference for Justin Sun’s tron. It is currently the biggest bag held in the hamster’s portfolio. Mr. Goxx has never sold tron. Mr. Goxx’s current portfolio also includes stellar, ether, bitcoin, and xrp.What do you think about the impressive trading performance of Mr. Goxx compared to other popular financial indexes?

He believes that “bitcoin may crash too.” The famous author also offered his opinion on China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies.Famous author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has predicted that a “giant stock market crash” is coming in October, noting that gold, silver, and bitcoin may crash as well.Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.Kiyosaki tweeted Saturday:Giant stock market crash coming October. Why? Treasury and Fed short of T-bills. Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash too. Cash best for picking up bargains after crash. Not selling gold, silver, bitcoin, yet have lots of cash for life after stock market crash. Stocks dangerous. Careful.Kiyosaki has been vocal in predicting the greatest market crash. In June, he warned that the “biggest crash” in the world’s history was coming since the “biggest bubble” in the world’s history was “getting bigger.” He suggested at the time to buy more gold, silver, and bitcoin.The famous author said in August: “Bitcoin has the greatest upside. With dollar dropping, bitcoin and silver are the best investments.” He also shared: “The primary reason I invest in bitcoin, gold, and silver is because I do not trust our leaders, the Fed, Treasury, nor the stock market. Unfortunately, mom and pop who save money do.”On Friday, after the news of China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author commented:China announced this morning a new crackdown on crypto. What does that mean? It means China is about to launch its government crypto coin. If U.S. follows, Fed coin means bitcoin outlawed, U.S. becomes centralized gov, like China, U.S. communism begins, our freedoms end.While China is already heavily testing the digital yuan, the U.S. Federal Reserve still has not decided whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the Fed will soon publish a discussion paper on the subject.Some people see China’s action to crack down on crypto as positive news, including several U.S. lawmakers, who said the Chinese crypto crackdown is a big opportunity for the U.S. to lead in the area of cryptocurrencies. “China’s authoritarian crackdown on crypto, including bitcoin, is a big opportunity for the U.S. It’s also a reminder of our huge structural advantage over China,” Senator Pat Toomey opined.What do you think about Robert Kiyosaki’s predictions?

The first is China reiterating its anti-crypto and anti-freedom stance. The second is the U.S. Federal Reserve “putting taper in motion,” and the third is the big overhead resistance level for bitcoin and ether. Novogratz noted that he believes BTC and ETH will consolidate.At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin stands at $43,695 and the price of ether stands at $3,090 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Furthermore, the billionaire CEO believes that the bitcoin market is in good shape. In an interview with CNBC last week, he explained that the $40,000 level for bitcoin and $2,800 for ethereum “are very important levels for people to watch,” noting:As long as those hold, I think the market is in good shape.Novogratz further shared: “I’ve seen nothing but engagement activity from our investing clients and our corporate clients. The level of inquiry, the level of business hasn’t been higher.” He continued:We see so much capital coming into the space, in private ways and public ways. I am not nervous.Commenting on China’s influence over the prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC and ETH, Novogratz said: “It was a lot more important five months ago before China basically said we’re banning crypto so miners have moved out of China.”He continued: “China was never a big source of innovation in the space but it was a big source of trading and I think there’s still plenty of trading in China … The Chinese are smart, they know how to use VPNs, but it’s harder and harder and so I think it’s less and less important.”Do you agree with Mike Novogratz?

479,"China's Crackdown Spurs Massive Onchain Transfers, Cold Wallets Move $3 Billion in Bitcoin and 800K Ether","Sep 26, 2021","Following the latest statements from China’s central bank concerning cryptocurrencies and offshore crypto exchanges, massive amounts of funds have been moving onchain. On September 26, at approximately 1:00 a.m. (UTC) 72,999 BTC or $3.1 billion in bitcoin was dispersed to unknown wallets.Word around the crypto campfire is that offshore exchanges near China are seeing massive amounts of crypto transfers during the last few days. For instance, theblockcrypto.com writer Wolfie Zhao revealed on September 25 that the Chinese government’s crackdown has “spooked some retail users” and the action had spilled over to over-the-counter (OTC) markets.Zhao’s report shows a screenshot of “OTC merchant quotes for USDT against Chinese yuan on Huobi.” Following Zhao’s report, Huobi detailed to users on Sunday that the crypto exchange would “gradually retire existing mainland China users.”Meanwhile, a lot of money has been moved onchain and some of the crypto wallets have been flagged as allegedly belonging to Huobi. For instance, on September 26, approximately 800,000 ether worth $2.4 billion was “transferred from Huobi to [an] unknown wallet[s],” Whale Alert’s Telegram channel detailed on Sunday.The massive ether transfers were sent in 100K ETH transactions. There’s a number of transfers of a few thousand ETH from Huobi to unknown wallets as well.Onchain action from the Bitcoin (BTC) network saw at least 72,999 BTC or $3.1 billion in bitcoin transferred on September 26. The bitcoin movements stemmed from two large wallets and one of them is classified as possibly being Huobi’s cold storage wallet. While the count caught by the onchain parsers showed 72,999 BTC, a third parser indicates that the total amount received by the wallet “1Njh,” at least at the time of writing, is 104,999 BTC in total.Records from oxt.me indicate that at least one of the two BTC addresses, was flagged twice as a possible Huobi cold storage wallet. Moreover, the movement was discovered by the parser software developed by btcparser.com and the Telegram research group Gold Found In Sand.​​”Today our second parser noticed an interesting transfer for an impressive 72,999 bitcoin,” a member of the onchain research group Gold Found In Sand told Bitcoin.com News. “Don’t panic. This is the Huobi exchange moving its funds. But what happens next is not yet entirely clear. Funds from the ‘1Njh’ wallet began to be withdrawn in transactions of 2,000 BTC and each has one recipient of approximately 1,800 BTC and the rest of the funds are distributed between different small wallets.” The Gold Found In Sand member further added:Perhaps this is a new mechanism for distributing funds. What if (come on) this is a preventive reaction of the exchange to the next sneeze of their government? In any case, our parsers continue to monitor the situation. And all this movement with the transfer of funds is clearly visible from the bird’s eye view of the third parser.The researcher noted that the team has an idea that it could be somehow coupled to the recent announcement stemming from the Chinese government.“Yes,” the Gold Found In Sand researcher remarked. “We know the [Chinese] government made a lot of similar announcements in the past. And such a movement happened only today. Which is strange.” What was most peculiar of it all was the movement and how the transfers were arranged the researcher highlighted.“What we found strange was that the money that went out in transactions of 2,000 BTC, but also inside those 2,000, there is one address receiving almost 1,800+ bitcoin, and a dozen smaller ones… And those smaller ones, we are curious about them. Could that be withdrawals of current Chinese clients? Well, it’s just an idea, we don’t know the truth yet,” the researcher concluded.What do you think about the large ethereum transfers and the $3.1 billion worth of bitcoin that moved on Sunday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

480,London College Student Robbed at Knifepoint by 8 Thugs for $93K in Bitcoin,"Sep 25, 2021","Recently a student from the University of Kent in London was robbed at knifepoint for his bitcoin. After eight thugs stormed his dorm room and demanded that he reveal his crypto credentials and passwords, the student was forced to leave the campus and he moved back home. A recent report shows that a college student who started the year as a freshman was robbed at the University of Kent, a school located in the historic city of Canterbury. The student’s mother details that five days before starting his course, her son started to talk about cryptocurrencies with a friend from the school.“They were just having lads’ talk. [Then] the conversation turned to [finance] and the friend started talking about cyber currency,” the student’s mother explained. After the discussion, the boy’s friend alleges that the student brought eight friends from East London to visit the student’s room and he instantly “knew he was in trouble,” his mother declared.The student says that his bitcoin stash was worth around £6,000 ($8.2K) at the time he was robbed. But now that same stash of bitcoin is worth £68K ($93,000) and the gang of thugs stole £3,000 worth of his school grant money. The student then called the police and ran to the security hut and the student’s mother said the security guards didn’t go to the crime scene. The police never arrived because there were more important matters to attend to that evening. The student’s mother stressed:The only action the university took was moving him to different accommodation. He was too traumatised so he moved back home even though he had safer and better accommodation.To make matters worse, the money was never returned to the student. The Canterbury District Police Department dropped the case after eight months. The mother detailed that she was upset that the Kent security guards and police did nothing. She also warned other freshmen students that the same could happen to them.“The police commonly call Freshers’ Week ‘fishing week’ because all the criminals come down,” she said. “They know the students have got grants, laptops, and new stuff. Attacks, assaults, and muggings are quite common across the country,” the student’s mother added.The fact of the matter is, it is not wise to disclose crypto asset holdings to others, unless you truly trust them. Bitcoin muggings have been taking place for years, but there’s been an increase in crypto robberies that leverage violence to steal bitcoin or other digital assets, since the crypto economy’s massive rise in value during the latter half of 2020.What do you think about the college student that was robbed at knifepoint by eight thugs and his so-called friend?

481,A Rocky Start for Bukele's Bitcoin Law — El Salvador After Adoption,"Sep 25, 2021","The adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador has been one of the biggest events in the cryptocurrency world this year. However, Nayib Bukele, president of the country, has taken a course of action many consider mistaken. In any case, the Bitcoin Law has put Bitcoin in the global spotlight as a potential engine for financial change in the Central American country. When President Nayib Bukele announced he would push to approve a law declaring bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, he might not have expected to set in motion all of the events that have happened as a consequence of that decision. Be it for people that approve of this decision, or citizens that are not comfortable with it (most Salvadorans, according to some polls), bitcoin has become a part of the political panorama in the country. As such, it is being harnessed by political agents as a very important part of Bukele’s mandate.The irruption of bitcoin, a totally external element, into Salvadoran politics, has caused a shift that might not be completely favorable to the government after all. Bukele, who was often hailed as an outsider, elected as a result of the anger that citizens had for career politicians, had succeeded in maintaining this support due to his actions against criminal actors. Often, protests against him were small events, only gathering dozens of people.But bitcoin and other happenings changed this, powering rallies against the government with massive attendance. On September 15, the biggest protest against Bukele’s government brought together thousands of people, marking a clear departure from the little demonstrations of discontent he had faced thus far. This is unlikely to affect his government in the short term, as polls suggest he still has an 80% approval rating, but it does make a dent in his record as the people’s leader.While everyone saw the pictures of fast food chains accepting bitcoin as payment, the truth is that bitcoin is still far from being accepted universally in the country. And the government is in part responsible for this. A citizen has reported on the inability to pay for a government-related certificate with bitcoin, something that supposedly is very common in some areas.According to some reports, this scene is playing out frequently in regard to other government functions where the law has still not been adopted, and people cannot pay with bitcoin.Salvadorans also don’t seem to be much enthusiastic about bitcoin adoption in the country. There have been reports of long lines of people withdrawing the $30 dollars in BTC that were given by the administration to each citizen. And while the government had announced this wouldn’t be possible, Salvadorans found a way of doing it.Residents of the country discovered that sending these funds to another wallet seems to unlock the $30 for withdrawal, without having to spend it via the state-created Chivo wallet as bitcoin. This is reportedly the cause of the long lines to withdraw fiat dollars at several Chivo wallet cashiers in the country. According to some reports, the mass of Salvadorans still don’t understand what bitcoin is or its use cases, and in this regard, the government has a big job in educating its citizens about the true value of bitcoin.What do you think about the state of El Salvador after declaring bitcoin legal tender? Tell us in the comments section below.

482,Morgan Stanley's Executive Likens Bitcoin's Resilience to Kenny Who Dies in Every South Park Episode,"Sep 24, 2021","Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Dennis Lynch, says that bitcoin’s resilience is like Kenny from the popular TV series South Park. In almost every episode, Kenny comically died but always came back, just like how bitcoin bounces back every time after a bear market.Morgan Stanley’s Dennis Lynch talked about bitcoin’s resilience at Morningstar’s annual investment conference Thursday. Lynch is head of the Counterpoint Global team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the bank’s asset management arm. He joined Morgan Stanley in 1998 and has 27 years of investment experience. The Morgan Stanley Counterpoint Global team “invests primarily in established and emerging companies globally,” the firm’s website describes.Lynch compared the cryptocurrency’s ability to recover and bounce back from bear markets and massive sell-offs to Kenny, a character from the popular TV cartoon series South Park, stating:I like to say that bitcoin’s kind of like Kenny from South Park — he dies every episode, and is back again.The South Park show follows the stories of four boys: Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick. During the show’s first five seasons, Kenny died in nearly every episode before returning in the next with little-to-no definitive explanation given.The Morgan Stanley executive said that like Kenny of the Comedy Central franchise, bitcoin just keeps coming back.According to “Bitcoin Obituaries” by 99 Bitcoin, BTC has died 430 times, including 37 times so far this year. By comparison, the cryptocurrency only died 14 times in 2020 and 41 times in 2019.Lynch added that bitcoin “demonstrates some ‘anti-fragile’ qualities,” elaborating:It kind of sits in the portfolio in a small manner, that it possibly is something that can go right when the rest of our portfolios having something go wrong … Ten years from now, given bitcoin’s persistence, is worth a small speculation.The executive said he can envision bitcoin “benefiting from different environments, whether people look at it as a digital gold, or people start to really question fiat currency, given all the stimulus and the policy there,” citing the Fed’s “accommodating” policies and the low-rate environment.Morgan Stanley was among the first major banks to embrace bitcoin. The firm made bitcoin funds available to clients back in March and added bitcoin to 12 mutual funds‘ investment strategies the following month. In addition, the global investment bank recently launched a dedicated cryptocurrency research team.What do you think about comparing bitcoin to Kenny from South Park?

483,"Twitter Launches Bitcoin Tipping Feature, Explores NFT Authentication","Sep 23, 2021","Twitter has begun rolling out “Tips,” a feature that allows users to send bitcoin or cash tips. The rollout begins with iOS users with Android coming soon. The company is also planning support for non-fungible token (NFT) authentication.Twitter Inc. announced Thursday that it is rolling out the bitcoin tipping feature starting with iOS users. The company tweeted: “Tested the Tips feature, turns out people love money. Rolling out on iOS with Android coming soon.” Twitter described:Tips allows you to send bitcoin or cash tips depending on how you configure your Tips settings and the regional availability of third-party payment providers.Twitter Support tweeted explaining how to use the new tipping feature. “Looking to get a little support with Tips? Tips is now rolling out to everyone (18+) on iOS. Add the Tips icon to your profile from the ‘Edit profile’ button,” the support account wrote.Esther Crawford, Twitter’s product manager, detailed that when an account has turned on Tips, the Tips icon will appear next to the follow button on the profile page. “Tap the icon, and you’ll see a list of payment services or platforms that the account has enabled, and you can select whichever you prefer,” she wrote, emphasizing:Once you tap the service you want to use, you’ll be taken off Twitter to the selected app to send funds. Twitter takes no cut.“In addition to the services currently enabled through Tips, people can now seamlessly tip with bitcoin using Strike — a payments application built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network that allows people to send and receive bitcoin. Strike offers instant and free payments globally,” Crawford added.Strike is available in the U.S., excluding Hawaii and New York, as well as in El Salvador, where bitcoin is now legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Users in eligible markets can sign up for a Strike account and add their Strike username to receive bitcoin tips over the Lightning Network. “You can use any Bitcoin Lightning wallet to send tips to someone’s Strike account,” the product manager clarified.“When you enable Tips on your profile, you can now also add your bitcoin address. People can copy your address and paste it into a bitcoin wallet of their choice to send you a payment directly,” she noted.Besides Strike, other payment options and platforms currently available are Bandcamp, Cash App, Chipper, Gofundme, Patreon, Picpay, Razorpay, Wealthsimple Cash, and Paypal’s Venmo.In addition, Twitter announced that it is also planning to support authentication for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). “We’re excited to soon explore NFT authentication,” Crawford was quoted as saying. “It’s a way to support creators making this art with a stamp to demonstrate authenticity. By allowing people to directly connect their crypto wallets, they can track and showcase their NFT ownership on Twitter.”She added: “We’re interested in basically just making it visually clear that this is an authenticated avatar and then give you some interesting info and insight about the provenance of that NFT.” A Twitter spokesperson said:NFT authentication will come in the form of a badge, shown on profile pictures, marking the owner’s NFT as authentic.What do you think about Twitter’s bitcoin tipping feature and NFT authentication?

484,Hackers Compromise Web Portal Bitcoin.org — DNS Hijack Replaces Site With BTC Doubler Scam,"Sep 23, 2021","On Thursday, the pseudonymous operator of Bitcoin.org told the public on Twitter that the web portal has been “compromised.” The operator, Cobra, explained that the hackers were able to implement a bitcoin doubler scam model and stressed that the site would be down for a “few days.”The mysterious operator of the web portal Bitcoin.org, Cobra, is once again surrounded by controversy. According to the pseudonymous operator of the website, Bitcoin.org has been attacked. “Bitcoin.org has been compromised,” Cobra tweeted early Thursday morning (EST). “[I am] currently looking into how the hackers put up the scam model on the site. May be down for a few days.”The scam model Cobra speaks of is a doubler scam that attempts to entice people to deposit a fraction of bitcoin with the promise of doubling the deposit. Of course, victims who deposit funds into the doubler scam never get the double reward, as the hackers simply take all the funds after they have accumulated to something worthwhile.According to one account, the scammers were able to get $17,000 in bitcoin (BTC) while the phony page was online. Some have said that the scam wallet did not make as much money as the website displayed.“For context, 3 people have sent $100, 1 person has sent around $200, the rest(0.4 BTC) seems to have been sent as a way to make the ‘giveaway’ seem legitimate, so likely [a] scammer’s own coins,” one individual mentioned.The operator behind the website nuke.asia said that the takeover was most likely “social engineering.”“It appears the domain was taken over,” Charles from nuke.asia said. “The WHOIS info was updated at the time of the hack, the nameservers + DNS changed, and if you try to visit any of the actual pages other than the index you’ll get a 404. It’s a completely different website save for the domain name.”Meanwhile, Cobra has also been tweeting to the company Cloudflare for assistance. “Bitcoin.org hasn’t been hacked, ever. And then we move to Cloudflare, and two months later we get hacked. Can you explain where you were routing my traffic too? Because my actual server didn’t get any traffic during [the] hack. @Cloudflare @eastdakota,” Cobra said. Then someone asked Cobra if his accounts were compromised. Cobra stressed:Nope, nothing. None of my accounts seem compromised. Server is fine too (it wasn’t even getting traffic during the hack). The attackers just seem to have exploited some flaw in the DNS.What do you think about Bitcoin.org getting compromised by hackers who replaced the site’s main page with a doubler scam?

485,This Crowdsourced Project Attempts to Reveal American Politicians That Own Bitcoin,"Sep 21, 2021","On September 19, 2021, the software developer and cofounder of Casa, Jameson Lopp, announced a new project called bitcoinpoliticians.org which sifts through Congressional financial disclosures and records them into a database. Lopp says the aim is to create “more transparency around bitcoin ownership” and so far he’s analyzed about 13% of Congressional financial disclosures.These days politicians owning bitcoin has become a rising trend during the last few years in contrast to the early days when bureaucrats criticized the concept regularly. There’s definitely a great number of politicians that still hate bitcoin and the crypto economy, but now lawmakers are starting to see the benefits of the technology and there’s a number of bureaucrats in a variety of countries who now own the leading crypto asset.Members of Congress and other U.S. federal leaders are required to disclose their finances to the public, as was the case with the recent scrutiny against senior Federal Reserve officials and the Fed chairman Jerome Powell. The cofounder of Casa Jameson Lopp started a new project called bitcoinpoliticians.org which attempts to record bitcoin ownership among U.S. bureaucrats.“Based upon public financial disclosures, we can know which politicians in Congress actually have skin in the game,” the website explains. “Because searching through financial disclosures can be a time-intensive process, this project’s goal is to crowdsource the work.” Lopp details in a tweet that he’s “analyzed 13% of the 538 reports” stemming from the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and the U.S. Executive Branch.Lopp is hoping that the crypto community will help finish the rest of the reports in order to have a more accurate list of bitcoin-holding U.S. politicians. “I estimate about 40 hours of labor required to research and fill in the remaining 435 Congress members’ financial disclosures on bitcoinpoliticians.org,” Lopp added on Tuesday. “A full week of work for a sole contributor, but far less if a few dozen folks lookup 10 disclosures each.”While scanning the list of U.S. bureaucrats from the Senate, House, and Executive Branch, a great number of the politicians listed have either a “no” or a question mark next to their name. This means the person either definitely does not own bitcoin by their own testimony or at the moment the politician’s financial disclosure has not yet been assessed by Lopp or community members. There is only one “yes” mark next to the politicians listed and that person is the Republican Cynthia Lummis.According to Lopp’s website, Lummis owns around $100K – $250K of bitcoin (BTC). However, Lopp’s website does mention that the Republican Patrick Toomey owns the Grayscale products GBTC and ETHE. Bitcoinpoliticians.org does disclose a few American bureaucrats who own gold like the Republican Mitt Romney who owns $250K-$500K of gold bullion. The Republican Joshua Hawley owns $1K to $15K of the Gold Trust.As Lopp’s list has not been fully analyzed it does not mean Lummis is the only bitcoin owner. When the disclosures are fully combed through, there may be a few more U.S. bureaucrats who have disclosed that they own the leading crypto asset.What do you think about Jameson Lopp’s bitcoinpoliticians.org website? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The protocol acknowledged that an attacker managed to exploit a bug in its codebase to take control of the stolen bitcoin. The bridging contracts are currently working as usual but with extra security measures enabled.Pnetwork, a decentralized finance bridging protocol, informed users it was the victim of a hack, losing 277 bitcoin in the attack. Pnetwork eases mobility of assets like bitcoin and ether among several chains. This contributes to extending the liquidity of each decentralized finance environment on different chains.Pnetwork reported that a bug in its codebase was used to perpetrate this attack. The bug allowed the attacker to siphon 277 bitcoin that was being bridged to the Binance Smart Chain network. No other bridges or networks were affected in the process. The protocol’s team has already found the bug and introduced a patch to fix it. In a tweet, the team declared that:Bridges are being extensively reviewed for that and similar exploits. The bridges will be gradually reactivated over the next few days.Pnetwork also made a proposal to the attackers, asking them to return the funds in exchange for a bounty. It stated:To the black hat hacker. Although this is a long shot, we’re offering a clean $1,500,000 bounty if funds are returned. Finding vulnerabilities is part of the game, unfortunately, but we all want the defi ecosystem to continue growing, returning funds is a step in that direction.If such a return actually happens, it won’t be the first time. This happened with Polynetwork, another decentralized finance protocol, when the attacker returned more than $600 million that was stolen. Another instance is the recent hack of Miso, the new token issuance platform on the Sushi protocol.However, this time the exploit was a little different. Miso’s team was able to link the possible identity of the attacker to the funds. Polynetwork had similar information. After this, funds were returned. In Pnetwork’s case, there has still not been a response at the time of writing. Pnetwork stated it is making it a priority to reimburse users, but has not elaborated on how.What are your thoughts on the Pnetwork hack? Tell us in the comments section below.

487,Bitcoin.com Wallet Adds ERC-20 Tokens,"Sep 20, 2021","The Bitcoin.com Team is excited to announce the integration of ERC-20 tokens into the Bitcoin.com Wallet. That means anyone can now buy, sell, receive, store, trade, and send ERC-20 tokens with the convenience and security of the industry’s most user-friendly non-custodial wallet.ERC-20 is the standard protocol for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. There are over 450,000 sets of ERC-20 tokens as of 2021 and they collectively represent hundreds of billions of dollars in value. All ERC-20 tokens “live” on Ethereum, meaning they benefit from the security of the second-largest blockchain by marketcap and are composable with smart contracts.Any and all Ethereum-compatible tokens sent to your Bitcoin.com Wallet’s Ethereum addresses are safe and secure. However, since there are hundreds of thousands of ERC-20 tokens out there, it’s not practical to display them all in the Wallet. That’s why we’re starting off by ‘tracking’ a selection of the most widely used ERC-20 tokens. For instance, when you open the wallet, you’ll now have quick access to the US dollar crypto ‘stablecoins‘ USDT and USDC. Additionally, the wallet will track five other major ERC-20 tokens at the outset. These are Uniswap, Wrapped BTC, Compound, Yearn Finance, and Sushiswap.With USDT and USDC now supported, you can swap out of more volatile cryptoassets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to, for instance, lock in profits if you think the market is overheated. Then trade back into the coins you think are due for a run.If you’re in a supported region, you can buy USDT and USDC in the Bitcoin.com Wallet using local currency (by credit card etc.). If you’re resident in the US, UK, or EU, you can sell USDT or USDC and receive local currency straight to your bank account.The Bitcoin.com Wallet supports all other functions of ERC-20 tokens for all users. That means you can send and receive them, swap them for any of the other cryptoassets in the Wallet, and of course store them securely.Bitcoin.com is committed to supporting economic freedom, which is why our wallet is fully non-custodial. That means you’re in complete control of your crypto. No need to ask permission from a centralized exchange to instantly send your assets wherever you want, whenever you want. You’ll never be ‘deplatformed,’ and you have no exposure to the risk of a third party getting hacked or going bankrupt. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, so don’t forget to back up the ‘keys’ to your wallet and adhere to password management best practices.If you’re already using the Bitcoin.com Wallet on mobile, you can leverage your existing account to see and interact with your assets in a desktop-class dashboard. Track your portfolio and get real-time market data; receive, swap, buy & sell crypto – all from the spacious real estate of your desktop, tablet, or any browser-enabled device.

However, there are reports that the Salvadoran Court of Accounts is planning to investigate the government’s bitcoin ATM purchases and Chivo kiosk construction.The launch of the government’s bitcoin wallet, the Chivo wallet, was off to a rocky start. However, on Sept. 16, Bukele claimed that the Chivo app is “already working 100%” According to reports, remittance providers like Moneygram and Western Union could lose up to $400 million annually if the Chivo wallet is used more.On Friday, Bukele tweeted that 1.1 million Salvadorans already use the Chivo wallet, adding that “we haven’t enabled 65% of phone models yet.” He opined:It seems that we will be able to bank more people in 1 month than they did with nationalizations and privatizations of traditional banks in 40 years.What do you think about El Salvador buying more bitcoin?

490,"Bitcoin Hashrate Climbs 128% Over 83 Days, Network's Mystery Miners Disappear","Sep 19, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has been climbing higher during the last two weeks, hitting 174 exahash per second (EH/s) on two occasions since June 28. Currently, Bitcoin’s network hashrate is coasting along at 158 EH/s, up 128% since the low 83 days ago when it hit 69 EH/s. Meanwhile, unknown hashrate has subsided a great deal as 96% of the mystery miners recorded at the end of June have disappeared.Approximately 83 days or over two months ago, Bitcoin’s hashrate had slid to a low of 69 exahash per second (EH/s) on June 28. The slide was initiated by the crackdown in China against Chinese mining operations and a great majority of facilities were forced to relocate.Even well before the Chinese government’s crackdown, Chinese miners were already relocating and the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) project’s research indicated that by April 2021, China’s hashrate dominance was down to 46%.Since June 28, Bitcoin’s hashrate has increased a great deal, climbing 128% during the last 83 days. On two occasions, the hashrate jumped to 174 EH/s on August 23, and to 173.7 EH/s on September 14. At the time of writing, the hashrate is around 158 EH/s and has been maintaining above the 125 EH/s zone for the last two weeks.A number of other hashrates, stemming from various mineable blockchains, have also risen dramatically. Ethereum’s overall hashrate was down to 504 terahash per second (TH/s) over two months ago and today it is 740 TH/s. Ethereum’s hashrate has increased roughly 46.82% since June 25, 2021.Bitcoin (BTC) is also expecting an increase in difficulty again after four consecutive increases in mining difficulty since block height 693,504. BTC’s network hashrate jumped every two weeks with increases of 6.03%, 7.31%, 13.24%, and 4.54% as of block height 699,552.Metrics show the current difficulty is 18.42 trillion and in less than two days, an increase is expected to happen. At current hashrate speeds, the change is estimated to be around 3.52% higher than today at 19.06 trillion.BTC is becoming more difficult to mine and at 19.06 trillion it is slowly approaching the difficulty seen prior to June 13, 2021. Prior to this date, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty was above the 20 trillion zone and was far more difficult to find blocks since January 9, 2021 at block height 665,280.Before BTC block height 665,280, the mining difficulty was 18.6 trillion or lower. Today, the top three mining pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain include F2pool with 26.06 EH/s, Antpool with 22.68 EH/s, and Poolin with 21.46 EH/s. Interestingly, unknown hashrate or stealth miners have subsided to 306.55 petahash per second (PH/s) or 0.22% of the network.For some contrast, on June 22, 2021, unknown hashrate captured around 10 EH/s of Bitcoin hashpower at that time and over 12% of the global SHA256 hashrate. The metrics show that the 10,000 PH/s drop to 306.55 PH/s means 96.93% of the stealth hashrate has mostly disappeared over the course of 89 days.What do you think about the steady Bitcoin hashrate increase during the last few months?

491,"$2 Billion Worth of Unpeeled Casascius Physical Bitcoins: There's Less Than 20,000 Coins Left Active","Sep 18, 2021","While bitcoin continues to become more scarce every day, the most popular set of physical bitcoins, crafted by Mike Caldwell from 2011 to 2013, have become far scarcer than their digital counterparts. As of September 18, 2021, there are now less than 20,000 active bitcoins from the Casascius physical bitcoin collection.Bitcoin has become a well-known technology and in the early years a number of people and companies deployed concepts called “physical bitcoins.” Essentially, a group or individual would fabricate a coin with the bitcoin symbol etched on it and the coin would also hold digital BTC hidden within the coin’s body.It’s safe to say that the Casascius physical bitcoin collection created by Mike Caldwell is the most popular collection to date, and these rare physical bitcoins are sold for much more than the face value of the digital bitcoin they hold.Casascius bitcoins sport a holographic tamper-resistant sticker on one side of the coin, and if the sticker is peeled, the digital bitcoin’s private key is revealed. Caldwell crafted both coins and bars that held loaded bitcoin (BTC) and created series 1 (1-1,000 BTC), series 2 (0.5-500 BTC + the DIY Storage Bars), and series 3 (0.5-1 BTC).Unfortunately, the U.S. government forced Caldwell to stop minting Casascius bitcoins with loaded BTC on them. By the end of Caldwell’s tenure making these coins, he managed to mint around 27,920 Casascius bitcoins with various increments of loaded BTC. Over the years owners have redeemed the loaded value held on these Casascius bitcoins in a process called a “peel.”On December 23, 2019, Bitcoin.com News reported on a 100 BTC gold bar that was peeled or redeemed. This means the digital BTC value was spent by the owner and the physical bar is empty with zero digital value left. Ten years after the first Casascius bitcoins were minted, there’s under 20K left that are active with loaded BTC.According to statistics from casasciustracker.com, on September 18, 2021, there’s approximately 19.92K active Casascius bitcoins waiting to be peeled. So far 8,009 coins or bars have been redeemed over the last ten years and there’s approximately 43K BTC left unpeeled worth over $2 billion.48,169 BTC worth $2.3 billion has been spent by the peel process. Furthermore, there are some lucky owners who still have yet to peel 1,000 BTC bars or coins worth $48 million using today’s exchange rates. For instance, out of the six 1,000 BTC Series 1 Casascius bitcoins, only 2 have been redeemed so far.In that same series, Caldwell minted 16 1,000 BTC bars and so far 87.50% or 14 bars have been redeemed. There were 81 Series 2 100 BTC coins (worth $4.8M each) minted by Caldwell and to date 47 coins or 58.02% of the BTC has been redeemed from that minted set.Today, the Casascius physical bitcoin collection has gathered significant numismatic value and the coins and bars are considered coveted bitcoiner collectibles. Even peeled Casascius bitcoins still hold value and some of them are being sold for $1,999 (for a 2012 piece). A loaded silver Casascius physical bitcoin with 0.1 BTC ($4,834) from 2013 is selling for $20,000 today. A rare unloaded set of 125 Casascius physical bitcoins made of aluminum is selling for $4,995.What do you think about the fact that there are now less than 20,000 Casascius bitcoins left active today? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

492,We Are All Satoshi: Statue of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Unveiled in Hungary,"Sep 18, 2021","A statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, has been unveiled in Budapest, Hungary. “The statue is made of bronze, the face is made of a special bronze-aluminium composite, thus every visitor can see their own face when looking at Satoshi. We are all Satoshi.”A statue of bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was unveiled Thursday in the capital of Hungary, Budapest. It is located in Graphisoft Park. According to the initiative’s website:The goal of the statue is to honor Satoshi Nakamoto … his work is truly something to be remembered. Not just because of its significance in the world of IT, but because of its value for humanity in general.“Satoshi’s statue represents a general human figure, since we do not know the gender, race, age, height of the mysterious developer,” the website describes. “Satoshi is wearing a hoodie, with the Bitcoin logo on its chest. The statue is made of bronze, the face is made of a special bronze-aluminium composite, thus every visitor can see their own face when looking at Satoshi. We are all Satoshi.”The basic idea for a Satoshi statue came from András Györfi, editor of Hungarian crypto news site Kripto Akadémia. He said the statue is an effort to raise awareness of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.The statue is the work of two Hungarian sculptors, Gergely Réka and Tamás Gilly. They sought to portray a human form while staying true to the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto.Gilly told the Associated Press:It was a big challenge. It is very difficult to make a portrait sculpture of a person that we don’t know exactly what they look like. I hope that through the language of sculpture I have managed to convey the basic idea of Bitcoin, that it belongs to everyone and no one at the same time.What do you think about this statue of Satoshi Nakamoto?

493,Fintech Firm Revolut Pays for Dallas-Based Wework Workspace With Bitcoin,"Sep 17, 2021","The cryptocurrency-infused financial tech company Revolut has announced it has purchased a Wework office with bitcoin. Revolut detailed that the office space in Dallas, Texas will house 300 employees to prepare for the company’s U.S. expansion.On September 16, 2021, Revolut, the fintech firm that offers users cryptocurrency services and aims to provide the world with a “global financial superapp” announced a deal with Wework. According to the announcement, Revolut will be leveraging the Wework workspace at 6900 Dallas Parkway in Dallas, Texas. Revolut details that the payment for the workspace was settled in bitcoin (BTC). The company said on Thursday:Revolut will also be Wework’s first enterprise member to sign new space using cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin, as it establishes its largest office yet in the U.S.While the move aims to bolster Revolut’s U.S. expansion, Revolut said it is also introducing a concept called “Revlabs real estate strategy.” The company details that the first Revlabs space is now open in Melbourne at the Wework center at 222 Exhibition Street.“Revlabs will be designed to facilitate collaboration and teamwork, with around 70 percent of office space devoted to collaboration,” the company explained on Thursday. “The new format will cater to rapid headcount growth and provide spaces for creative thinking, brainstorming, training, and knowledge exchange – some of the face-to-face interactions that people have missed throughout the pandemic. There will also be quiet zones and space for meetings.”Wework also detailed that it looks forward to being a real estate partner with Revolut. Basically, Wework is an American commercial real estate firm that was created in 2010. It specializes in flexible shared workspaces and the service is used by tech startups and other types of companies in early developmental stages.The company, however, is not without controversy, and in 2019 it had issues as the owner, Softbank Group, reported major losses that year. In November 2019, close to 20% of the employees at Wework were laid off.That year, the company revealed it was changing the board and wanted to remove the CEO Adam Neumann to replace him with a new leader. Also, it aimed to remove Neumann’s family members from the board of directors. Neumann did eventually exit and left with a package estimated to be worth $1.7 billion, and the company followed up with lots of corporate changes.During the Revolut announcement, the global head of financial services sales at Wework, Nick Giraudeau, stressed that flexible shared workspaces are great for growing startups.“Wework is excited to be Revolut’s global real estate partner,” Giraudeau remarked. “We look forward to supporting their new standard for the future of work, with a progressive employee-led approach that prioritises flexibility, collaboration and choice. Flexibility is essential for growing companies, and by supporting transactions in cryptocurrency, we can offer choice and convenience while supporting Revolut’s innovative business.”What do you think about Revolut becoming a real estate partner with Wework and paying for a workspace in Dallas with bitcoin?

494,The Big Three Credit Agencies Critique El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption — S&P Global Warns of 'Immediate Negative Implications',"Sep 17, 2021","All of the ‘Big Three’ credit agencies have said that El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin could affect the country’s credit rating in a negative manner. After both Moody’s and Fitch Ratings published reports on the matter in El Salvador, S&P Global said that the bitcoin adoption has had “immediate negative implications for its credit rating.”On August 17, 2021, Bitcoin.com News reported on Fitch Ratings detailing that El Salvador adopting bitcoin (BTC) as a legal currency may push the country toward “regulatory and operating risks.”Moreover, Fitch said that the adoption of bitcoin would negatively affect the insurance system in the Latin American country. Fitch Ratings’ report in August followed Moody’s downgrade in June, after the ‘Big Three’ credit agency dropped the country to a Caa1 from a B3 rating and highlighted a “deterioration in the quality of policymaking.”S&P Global seems to agree with Fitch and Moody’s and on Friday, a report from reuters.com indicates that the credit agency S&P Global notices “immediate implications” after the country adopted bitcoin (BTC). One of the largest risks is getting support, S&P said from programs like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Moreover, the report said that S&P envisions an “increase [in] fiscal vulnerabilities.”“The risks associated with the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador seem to outweigh its potential benefits,” S&P explained on Thursday. “There are immediate negative implications for [the] credit.” Thomson Reuters’ Marc Jones highlights that El Salvador currently has a B- rating which means it is stable.S&P Global’s latest statements follow the recent action that’s been taking place in El Salvador. For instance, protestors took to the streets on September 15 and set a bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) on fire. Furthermore, a complaint filed by a human rights organization called Cristosal sent to the Salvadoran Court of Accounts wants the Salvadoran government investigated for the bitcoin ATM deals and kiosk construction.What do you think about S&P Global’s latest statements about El Salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender?

The investigation follows the recent protest in El Salvador against the adoption of bitcoin as the crowd set fire to a bitcoin ATM.On September 15, a large group of protestors took to the streets in San Salvador to protest the new bitcoin law implemented by Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele. It’s not the first time protests against the law have happened, but this time around a bitcoin ATM was set ablaze. Following the protest, El Salvador’s Court of Accounts is looking into a complaint about the Bukele regime’s bitcoin ATM buys and kiosk construction. A document was witnessed by Reuters staff and the complaint was filed by a human rights and transparency organization called Cristosal.The complaint Cristosal filed with the Salvadoran Court of Accounts is against six Board of Directors members of the Bitcóin Trust. Furthermore, the complaint is also against the Salvadoran secretariat of Commerce and Investments and members of the Finance and Economy ministries.The Court of Accounts (CoA) says the complaint was received on September 10, five days before the protest and torched ATM. The CoA can impose sanctions against Salvadoran government officials. Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele has been called a dictator and has been investigated before.For instance, in May Bukele’s New Ideas Party fired several Supreme Court members and the attorney general. Twenty government institutions linked to the Bukele administration were under investigation for manipulation and corruption. He then fired all those who were involved in the investigation. The news publication El Faro also accused Bukele of secretly negotiating a deal with Mara Salvatrucha, the most powerful gang in El Salvador. The latest investigation stemming from the CoA and Cristosal notes that an analysis of the bitcoin situation will take place.“Having admitted the complaint, it will proceed to carry out the legal analysis report and, in a timely manner, forward such report to the General Audit Coordination,” the CoA document reviewed by Reuters notes. The news outlet detailed that an unnamed source from Cristosal says that the complaint written to the CoA “has been accepted.” Moreover, the CoA has the power to start criminal proceedings if the investigation into the bitcoin ATM purchases and kiosk construction uncovers suspicious elements.What do you think about Cristosal’s complaint and the CoA starting an investigation into the Bukele regime’s bitcoin affairs?

496,"Model Suggests BTC Price Floor Is $39K, Survey Shows Hope for Year-End $100K Bitcoin Price","Sep 16, 2021","Bitcoin prices have been better after the second week of September, hovering around $46.5K to $48.5K per unit during the last two days. Meanwhile, bitcoin proponents still believe a significant second-leg up will be happening this year and a recent survey published by Plan B with 123,410 votes shows people believe bitcoin will reach $100K by Christmas 2021. Furthermore, a price model crafted by Will Clemente called “Illiquid Supply Floor” indicates that bitcoin prices may never drop below $39K again.Plan B is a pseudo-anonymous Twitter account (@100trillionusd) and the creator of the bitcoin price model called stock-to-flow (S2F). Plan B has stated in previous tweets that September bitcoin (BTC) prices may be lackluster, and this week he said “let’s skip September and go straight to October.”He said this because in a tweet he wrote on June 20, Plan B expects bitcoin prices to follow this path: “Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K.” So far, Plan B’s August bitcoin price prediction and even so far in September, has been on point.On September 11, 2021, Plan B decided to do a Twitter survey as he has done on various occasions in the past. Plan B has 799.1K Twitter followers so his survey gets around on the social media platform. The survey he shared last Saturday asked the following question on Twitter:Do you think bitcoin will reach $500K, $288K (S2FX model), $100K (S2F model), or will BTC stay below $100K… by Christmas 2021?123,410 votes were cast in Plan B’s survey on Twitter and 45.7% believe it will reach $100K. Approximately 32.7% of those who voted think BTC will stay below $100K by Christmas 2021. 15.3% of the crowd suggest that they think $288K is possible and 6.3% believe that $500K per bitcoin could happen by the year’s end.In addition to Plan B’s recent survey, the lead insights analyst at Blockware Solutions, Will Clemente, tweeted about a price model called the “Illiquid Supply Floor.”“Introducing: Illiquid Supply Floor,” Clemente tweeted on September 15. “This combines Glassnode’s illiquid supply data with Plan B’s traditional S2F model, creating a price floor based on Bitcoin’s real-time scarcity. Currently $39K,” Clemente added. He also thanked Matt Faltyn for helping him bring the model “to life.”Crypto entrepreneur Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano congratulated Clemente on his chart and said: “This is a banger. Nice work.” Meanwhile, others were not so nice and called the model “hopium” in response to Clemente’s chart.“Combining old garbage with new garbage. Still garbage at the end of the day,” a critic tweeted. “Also, if bitcoin is so ‘scarce’ and due for a ‘supply shock’ then why has it not put in a new ATH in nearly 6 months? If it’s so rare, why has it been ranging between $30-50k for this long?”What do you think about Plan B’s survey with 123K votes and the recent “Illiquid Supply Floor” model tweeted by Will Clemente?

On June 9, he commented on the Bank of Canada holding the current level of the policy rate, tweeting: “Yes, continue to print money, debase the dollar, force all prices higher, impoverish the poorest, fund Trudeau’s gigantic deficit, distort the economy, fuel the housing bubble, and artificially boost the stock market, you moronic Keynesian bureaucrats.”In August last year, he tweeted in response to the news of the U.S. Federal Reserve making a major commitment to ramping up inflation. He wrote:These crazy Keynesian bureaucrats will do everything to dilute the purchasing power of your dollars and make you poorer.He noted at the time that “The Bank of Canada studied the same policy some years ago and may implement it too.”What do you think about Bernier’s comments and his support for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

499,Bridgewater's Ray Dalio Warns Regulators Will Kill Bitcoin If the Crypto Becomes 'Really Successful',"Sep 15, 2021","Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, believes that if bitcoin is “really successful,” the regulators will “kill it,” reiterating his previous concerns of governments banning cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, he sees bitcoin as a good alternative to cash and owns some.Ray Dalio warns about regulators coming after bitcoin if the cryptocurrency gains mainstream success at the SALT conference in New York Wednesday.Dalio currently serves as Bridgewater Associates’ chairman and co-chief investment officer. His firm’s clients include endowments, governments, foundations, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds. Referring to bitcoin, the Bridgewater boss said:I think at the end of the day if it’s really successful, they will kill it, and they will try to kill it. I think they will kill it because they have ways of killing it.This was not the first time Dalio warned about governments killing bitcoin. While he did not elaborate on how the regulators will kill the cryptocurrency, he said in May that they could impose tough regulation on the crypto market. He also said several times that governments could also ban or outlaw bitcoin.Regulators worldwide have been increasing efforts to regulate cryptocurrency, including the U.S., where Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been asking for more funds to increase oversight of the crypto sector.Other countries actively trying to regulate crypto include India, which is working on a cryptocurrency bill; China, which has been cracking down on crypto activities; and South Korea, where new crypto law will go into effect on Sept. 24. Meanwhile, El Salvador has made bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Dalio described:You have El Salvador taking it on and you have India and China getting rid of it. And you have the United States talking about how to regulate it and it could still be controlled.Dalio explained that bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, meaning it lacks fundamental and objective worth. He opined: “There are so many things in a historical perspective that didn’t have intrinsic value and had perceived value. And then it went hot and it became cold. It could be either way. You just have to know what it is. It could be tulips in Holland.”Nonetheless, the billionaire investor owns a small amount of bitcoin, seeing it as a good alternative to cash. The Bridgewater chief said:I think it’s worth considering all the alternatives to cash and all the alternatives to the other financial assets. Bitcoin is a possibility. I have a certain amount of money in bitcoin … It’s an amazing accomplishment to have brought it from where that programming occurred to where it is through the test of time.What do you think about Ray Dalio’s concerns regarding regulators killing bitcoin?

500,Ground Reports Concerning Salvadoran Bitcoin Law Highlight False Narrative Painted by Influencers,"Sep 15, 2021","On Tuesday, Bitcoin.com News spoke with Marc Falzon, an individual who has been documenting the bitcoin rollout in El Salvador since the law was implemented on September 7. Falzon says that there are a number of issues that no one is talking about in regard to the bitcoin law and the Chivo wallet, a government-crafted bitcoin wallet. One specific issue is the fact that Chivo wallet users cannot spend less than $5 when using the app. On September 7, 2021, El Salvador implemented the bitcoin tender law and now both bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. dollar are legal currencies in the country. There’s been a lot of controversy surrounding the rollout and one survey shows that a majority of Salvadorans were not content with the new law. There was even a street protest and Salvadoran citizens took to the streets to object against the new law. Marc Falzon recorded a protest on his drone and when he uploaded the recording to social media, a bitcoin influencer from El Salvador reposted the video and said it was misinformation.Interestingly, when Bitcoin.com News published the post concerning the protest, commenters said the same thing. Our news desk was told that the protest was a small handful of people that did not amount to anything relevant. Falzon said that he also uploaded some of his findings to the Reddit forum r/bitcoin and the post was flagged. Subsequently, Falzon was also banned from r/bitcoin, although he managed to get reinstated. The r/bitcoin mods complained that the post was “misleading” and Falzon has been getting a lot of flak for his reporting.Falzon’s reporting has been getting a lot of attention and his videos have been getting flak from so-called bitcoin influencers. Local media has covered Falzon’s findings and his point of view has been shared across various social media channels. Despite the criticism from some crypto supporters, there are those that believe his reporting has been 100% objective and on point.Speaking with Falzon on Tuesday, he explained that the situation is so bad it could leave a bad taste in Salvadorans in regard to cryptocurrencies in general. While some people believe that despite the initial problems and forcing the currency on Salvadorans, the end outcome will produce a silver lining, Falzon is not so sure. At the moment the issues are not sustainable for people who want to leverage microtransactions under $5 and his testing shows the Lightning Network feature on the Chivo wallet is losing transactions.Misinformation, Falzon says, is stemming from the popular bitcoin influencers who are painting a glossy and artificial narrative of how things have been going. There have been problems and influencers are acting as though everything works great while buying items from chains like McDonald’s and Starbucks. Bitcoin.com News asked Falzon about the issues with microtransactions, as spending small increments of money is necessary to buy food and things like coffee.“Right now in El Salvador any transaction (using the Chivo wallet) under the amount of five U.S. dollars is being blocked,” Falzon told Bitcoin.com News. “There was never any mention of that when the [bitcoin tender] act came out. In fact, they said in the commercial promoting Chivo wallet, to the population here, that people would be able to buy everything. But during the initial launch, people are not able to make any microtransactions.” Falzon added:Today is day six, and they [Chivo wallet] just announced that they will at some point, lower the minimum threshold to a single penny. So it seems like it will be a temporary problem.When asked if this was the case for both onchain bitcoin (BTC) transactions and the Lighting Network, Marc said: “Excellent question and that’s just something we don’t have an answer to right now.” Bitcoin.com News then asked if Lighting Network transactions were available at all.“That’s a complicated question and let me explain why. So in theory, yes, you can use Lightning for amounts over $5,” Falzon remarked. “However, in my testing, Lightning Network transactions at this time are being lost. To give you a specific example, in one of my videos I have a friend who is a local here send me $10 via Lightning Network to my wallet. That transaction was six days ago, that money still has not arrived in my wallet. Now what makes this scary is that the money has been deducted from my friend’s balance. So in his app, it shows he sent the money.”“To make matters even worse, in the Chivo wallet app there’s no way to see any information about the transaction,” Falzon continued. “One of the really big problems is that it’s not affecting me but that it’s affecting supermarkets and restaurants. To give you a specific example there’s a health food market near me and the owner is friends with all the owners of other supermarkets. She said that the other markets are worried because they have transactions sent in that are not showing up. So do you just let the customer just walk out of the store? By law, they need to accept the bitcoin transaction.”On August 24, Bitcoin.com News reported on the Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele promising that the bitcoin law would not be forced on citizens. Falzon says in some ways, Bukele’s statements are correct but in other instances, it is not true. “The president has said that bitcoin here in El Salvador was optional and that the Chivo app is also optional,” Falzon relayed. “However, that is actually not true. The president is correct that individuals can choose not to use the Chivo app. Like when they buy things they can use cash. They don’t have to use the Chivo app to use Lightning.” Falzon further added:However, merchants, store owners, business people, mom and pop shops, must accept bitcoin from the Chivo app. If the customer comes in and they want to buy something with the Chivo app, the merchant must accept it. For merchants acceptance is mandatory, and therefore the Chivo app is mandatory.“The way that the law is written, article seven says that all merchants must accept bitcoin by law, with the threat of force, you must do it,” Falzon emphasized in his statements on the phone. “However, article twelve in the law, says that merchants who are not currently able to be equipped as far as technology to accept the payment will not have to accept bitcoin until they have been properly equipped. About half the residents in El Salvador do not have an internet connection. For these people, from what I understand, they will not have issues with the government if they don’t accept it. Unless they are equipped to accept it.”Although Falzon said that some small businesses do have the capability to add the technology and they would be forced to accept bitcoin. “Some small business owners do have the technology, they do have mobile phones,” Falzon stressed. “These business owners would no longer fall under article twelve. Article twelve doesn’t mean you have a choice not to accept it, it means that you have a little more time before you have to. If you have the technology then you fall under article seven.” The cryptocurrency advocate continued:For most people it’s not a loophole, most people are just not accepting it here, period. They just say no. The only places that I have found that accept bitcoin right now, are large chains such as McDonalds, Starbucks, all the stuff that you would see from influencers. But the individual shops that I’ve seen that are equipped and I’ve offered to pay in bitcoin, they just say no. They don’t give a reason, they just say no.What’s even worse is that Falzon says many merchants are turning to an application crafted by the largest bank in El Salvador called Banco Agrícola. Instead of promoting a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, these Salvadoran merchants are handling bitcoin temporarily as they almost immediately get a fiat replacement for the bitcoin they accept.“The sad part about this is that the supermarkets and the business owners are getting an app called Wompi,” Falzon concluded. “What the Wompi app does is that it lets merchants accept bitcoin and it immediately converts it into USD and puts it in the merchant’s bank account. As if I paid in fiat. Businesses are using this app, to get around article seven,” Falzon highlighted. His findings show that the antiquated and centralized system of the past still remains fully functional.“What’s sad is that the Wompi app is made by the largest banking institution, Banco Agrícola S.A. (Banco Agrícola),” Falzon said. “Banco Agrícola developed the app. So basically, the situation that we have down here is [bitcoin is] not only not being used as a currency but it’s encouraging traditional centralized banking as it has always been.”What do you think about Marc Falzon’s findings and the situation in El Salvador? Do you agree with his assessment of the situation? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

501,"Bitcoin Will Not Become Legal Tender in Uzbekistan, Central Bank Official Insists","Sep 15, 2021","Cryptocurrency cannot be adopted as a means of payment in Uzbekistan, a high-ranking official from the country’s central bank has recently stated. Speaking to local media, the regulator’s representative also noted that unlike cryptocurrencies, the national fiat is backed by the bank’s assets. The statement comes in spite of Tashkent’s crypto-friendly moves in the past. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cannot be recognized as legal tender in Uzbekistan and that’s unlikely to ever change, a central bank official told Spot this week. Speaking to the local news outlet, the Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan (CBU) Behzod Hamraev said:As an economist, I can assume that it [cryptocurrency] will never be equal to world currencies such as the dollar, euro, yen, ruble.The representative of the monetary authority pointed out that 28 trillion Uzbekistani sum (the nation’s fiat money) are currently in circulation and they are all backed by the central bank’s assets. “You can even see an inscription of the regulator’s obligations on the banknotes, and cryptocurrency is not backed by anything,” he added.The government of Uzbekistan incorporated a ban on the use of cryptocurrency for payments into its legislation back in 2019. According to current law, the sum remains the only legal tender in the Central Asian country. A decree issued by the National Agency for Project Management, a regulatory body responsible for the oversight of the digital economy, emphasized:Crypto assets cannot be used on the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan as a means of payment.At the same time, the decree also introduced regulations governing the licensing and operation of cryptocurrency exchanges. Crypto trading was legalized in 2018 but in December 2019, authorities effectively banned residents from purchasing cryptocurrencies on the trading platforms while they were allowed to sell their crypto holdings.Then, in January 2020, Tashkent announced it planned to set up a national mining pool as a priority, establish a licensed cryptocurrency exchange where miners will be permitted to sell their digital coins, create a blockchain valley and introduce crypto tax exemptions. The regulated digital asset platform, Uznex, operated by the South Korean entity Kobea Group, was launched later the same month.The latest statement from the Central Bank of Uzbekistan regarding the status of cryptocurrencies comes after El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. It also follows a similar statement by Dmitry Peskov, spokesman of Russian president Vladimir Putin, who recently said Russia isn’t ready to accept the coin as a means of payment.Do you think Uzbekistan will change its policies towards cryptocurrencies in the future?

She also shared her view on cryptocurrency regulation and Coinbase’s trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Investment Management (Ark Invest), discussed bitcoin and crypto regulation in an interview at the SALT conference Monday. Wood is also the firm’s founder and CIO.She was asked what bitcoin will be worth five years from now. Wood replied, “If we are right and companies continue to diversify their cash into something like bitcoin, institutional investors start allocating 5% of their funds into … bitcoin, or other crypto,” then:We believe that the price will be tenfold of where it is today, so instead of $45,000, [it would be] over $500,000.Wood also commented on cryptocurrency regulation. Based on her meeting with state, local, and federal regulators, she described: “Our working assumption from the beginning was that … no regulator wanted to be blamed for preventing the next big technology breakthrough to happen in the U.S.”She proceeded to say she is “really happy” that the chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, “understands crypto and understands the merits of bitcoin in particular.” Nonetheless, she noted, “He is a regulator though and he’s a hardcore regulator.”The CEO of Ark Invest then talked about cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s trouble with the SEC regarding its lending product, noting that she “was shocked” to hear that Coinbase received a Wells Notice. “Are you kidding? They haven’t even released the product. What is this?” she exclaimed.Coinbase revealed last week that it received a Wells Notice from the SEC. However, the exchange said that it does not know what problem the SEC has with its Lend product. “We don’t know why … We got no explanation from the SEC,” the exchange wrote.“I think what that Wells Notice is doing, it’s a call out by regulators saying we got to discuss this stuff because this is happening very quickly and I think we are going to bring courts into the system,” Wood opined, adding:This happened in Canada. A company called 3iq sued the regulator there and won in court so they were able to issue bitcoin ETFs [exchange-traded funds], and closed in funds and ether as well.She concluded: “So, I’m beginning to think that Coinbase doesn’t mind it at all and if you saw the stock reaction, it hardly budged.”When asked which cryptocurrency she would invest in if she could pick just one, Wood said she would default to bitcoin “because countries are now deeming it legal tender.” The Ark Invest executive is referring to El Salvador where the country’s Bitcoin Law went into effect on Sept. 7 making BTC legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.Do you agree with Cathie Wood?

503,Shark Tank Star Kevin O'Leary Expects a 'Trillion Dollars' Flowing Into Bitcoin,"Sep 13, 2021","Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, expects a “trillion dollars” more to flow into bitcoin in the next couple of years. He also sees cryptocurrencies becoming an institutional asset class. “We don’t know when but it is definitely going to come. It’s not going away,” he said.Kevin O’Leary talked about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in an interview on CNBC’s Capital Connection, published Monday.“I’m bullish on crypto,” O’Leary began, adding that he is also bullish on decentralized finance (defi). Citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pushing back against Coinbase’s Lend product, he said: “That’s a slowdown in what is really emerging as a very interesting space.” Mr. Wonderful emphasized:We want the regulator to actually make some decisions about crypto, because none of us that are in financial services want to actually be cowboys about this. I don’t want to get involved in crypto if the regulator says it’s not okay.“I can’t afford to be off-side. I can’t afford to be non-compliant,” he continued.Referring to bitcoin in particular, the Shark Tank star said: “If the regulator finally allowed financial services companies to call it an asset, put it into an ETF [exchange-traded fund] in the United States, like they have in Canada and other countries, I’d figure there’d be another trillion dollars worth of buying into bitcoin. And we don’t have that yet, but that’s the opportunity.”Mr. Wonderful elaborated:I think at the end of the day, over the next couple of years, that will happen. That’s why there’s so much interest.At the current BTC price, the bitcoin market capitalization is $850.20 billion, based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.O’Leary added that all institutional investors want to know “when and how” the regulators will get on side of crypto and when they will consider cryptocurrencies an “institutional asset class.” He noted: “We don’t know when, but it is definitely going to come. It’s not going away.”Mr. Wonderful also revealed his intention to increase his crypto holdings, stating:I want to raise my exposure to crypto — currently at 3% — to 7% by the end of the year.What do you think about Kevin O’Leary’s comments about bitcoin and crypto?

506,Biggest Bank in El Salvador Now Accepts Bitcoin as Payment for Financial Products,"Sep 13, 2021","Bancoagricola, the biggest bank in El Salvador, is now accepting bitcoin to pay for debts originated from the use of its instruments, according to a PR statement. The institution partnered with Flexa, a payments network, to include cryptocurrency capabilities in its software. Bancoagricola also allows merchants using Wompi services (a digital payment processor) to receive bitcoin for goods and services sold.Bancoagricola, the biggest financial institution in El Salvador, has been one of the first to include bitcoin support for its financial instruments. This means that its customers will be able to pay for financial instruments (like loans, mortgages, and credit card debt) with bitcoin, complying with the bitcoin law.Customers of the bank that use a digital payments gateway known as Wompi, will also be able to receive payments in bitcoin through this service. Carlos Mauricio Novoa, COO of Bancoagricola, stated:We are excited to be the first financial institution in El Salvador to enable bitcoin access for our customers across our entire suite of financial products and to enhance financial inclusion.The bank also announced it aims to provide full support for bitcoin payments through their PoS terminals this year.To achieve this goal, Bancoagricola partnered with Flexa, a digital payments platform. This allowed the institution to easily integrate bitcoin-related services into the platform. Flexa will be integrated into Bancoagricola’s network of PoS, allowing customers to receive bitcoin payments directly. Banks and other businesses are starting to include bitcoin in their payments network to comply with the legal tender status that was approved for bitcoin on June 9.Trevor Filter, the co-founder of Flexa, stated:The opportunity to partner with organizations as innovative and world-class as Bancoagrícola and Grupo Bancolombia so that we can support better payment technology for millions of Salvadorans in such a tangible and impactful way is simply incredible.Bancoagricola has more than 1,000 customer attention points all over the country, with more than 5,400 employees serving customers. So the impact that this inclusion can have over how citizens pay their debts is important. More banks are expected to announce several deals in the coming days, to also accommodate customers according to the promulgated law.Even with all this movement surrounding bitcoin, most Salvadorans (seven of ten) are against the use of it as a legal tender according to a poll organized by the University Institute of Public Opinion.What do you think about Bancoagricola integrating Bitcoin services in El Salvador?

509,"Bitcoin Could 'Go up Significantly,' Says CIO of World’s Largest Asset Manager Blackrock","Sep 11, 2021","The chief investment officer of the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, says he could see bitcoin going up significantly. “I like assets that are volatile that have upside convexity,” he said.Rick Rieder, Blackrock’s chief investment officer (CIO) of Global Fixed Income, was asked Friday in an interview with CNBC about his view on bitcoin now that the cryptocurrency is legal tender in a country.Blackrock is the world’s largest asset manager, with about $9.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) at the end of the second quarter. Rieder is also the firm’s head of the Fundamental Fixed Income business and head of the Global Allocation Investment Team. He is responsible for roughly $2.4 trillion in assets.Rieder began by commenting on the popular opinion that cryptocurrency is either “a hedge or an alternative [currency].” Regarding cryptocurrency as a hedge, he said, “I’m not sure it’s a really great hedge,” citing its correlation to equities and risk assets. Noting that its price can move 15% a day, he reiterated, “I’m not sure it’s a great hedge.”Regarding cryptocurrency as “an alternative currency,” he opined:Part of why I own a small piece of bitcoin is I do think there are more people who are going to enter that fray over time … I like assets that are volatile that have upside convexity. I could see bitcoin go up significantly.Rieder noted that Blackrock has a “very moderate” amount of cryptocurrency in its portfolio. Emphasized that bitcoin is volatile, he said he does not see it as a core asset like bonds or stocks. Nonetheless, he sees value in having a small amount as a speculative tool in a portfolio.In November last year, he said that cryptocurrency was here to stay and could even replace gold to a large extent.Do you agree with Blackrock’s CIO?

510,Hip Hop Star Ja Rule Discusses the Growing NFT Space and Crypto — 'I Like the Fact That Bitcoin Is Decentralized',"Sep 11, 2021","The non-fungible token (NFT) industry has exploded in 2021 as millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies continue to be traded for these blockchain collectibles every single day. This week, Bitcoin.com News chatted with the popular American rapper Ja Rule about NFTs as he has partnered with James Cropcho and Robert Testagrossa to build a marketplace called flipkick.io.Yesterday, Bitcoin.com News spoke with recording artist Ja Rule, who is well known for his chart-topping albums and songs like the number 1 hit “Always on Time” (featuring Ashanti) in 2002. The musician is now involved with non-fungible tokens and helped form a unique NFT marketplace with serial entrepreneur Robert Testagrossa (Flipkick’s CEO) and engineer James Cropcho (Flipkick’s CTO). Flipkick.io is a full-service NFT marketplace that caters to artists, celebrities, and creators who want to monetize their work with physical NFTs.Ja Rule told our publication that’s a big difference when he discussed his fascination for NFTs and how Flipkick.io offers its NFT experience. In addition to the NFT space, Ja Rule delved into other subjects such as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Moreover, a couple of hosted NFT artworks listed on Flipkick.io were tied to the infamous Fyre Festival theme and Ja Rule spoke candidly about the subject. While the Fyre Festival was a fiasco he said, there was a “silver lining” in the end. The rapper also believes cryptocurrencies are just the next progression of economics and he believes the NFT space will someday be a multi-billion dollar industry.Bitcoin.com News (BCN): When did you first hear about non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?Ja Rule: You know it’s hard for me to put a date on that, I don’t really know the date. It was early in the year and I haven’t been on NFTs for that long. My first introduction into it was with NBA Top Shot. I started collecting Top Shot NFTs and I didn’t even realize they were NFTs at the time.I just thought they were like the new digital sports cards. You know, that type of thing. I started collecting those because I collect regular sports cards. That was like the next obvious progression for sports cards and so I started collecting those and then a friend of mine let me know that what I was collecting was actually NFTs. He told me that ‘you already been collecting them – NBA Top Shots are NFTs.’So then, I went further down the rabbit hole and got on to Opensea and the rest is kind of history. Once you get on Opensea everything unfolds.BCN: In addition to NFTs, what do you think about the rise of digital currencies like bitcoin?Ja Rule: I love bitcoin, I love ethereum, I love cryptocurrencies and decentralization and I think that it’s the next obvious step in economics. It’s going to be an interesting next five or ten years.BCN: Are you exposed to digital assets like bitcoin or ethereum?Ja Rule: I hold a little bitcoin, ethereum, solana, and cardano. I actually have my own cryptocurrency, it’s really a social token that I have with a company called ICONN. I haven’t launched it or anything yet but I guess this is going to be my coming out party because I just mentioned it. I have my own currency, I just haven’t launched it yet but it’s definitely ready to go.The thing with cryptocurrencies is it has to have utility. So I am building out that utility for ICONN which also has a live-streaming platform, ICONN Live. It’s in the App Store now and you can download that and that will be one of the ways you can use [the] ICONN [token] as well.BCN: How did you get involved with the Flipkick market concept? Ja Rule: Man, Flipkick.io is such a great idea. So as I got into NFTs I noticed a dope project and the whole angle was something different, which I really loved. The angle of taking physical works of art and authenticating them in a similar way NFTs are authenticated on the blockchain but with a chip. We have a patent pending on our technology, and when I say ours it’s because I’m part of the company.It’s just a smart thing to be able to authenticate physical artworks cryptographically and let these amazing artists be able to enjoy the fruits of their work and it was never possible before in the past. So I really applaud what Flipkick is as far as the physical NFT space.BCN: There are a few Flipkick.io-listed NFTs tied to the subject of the Fyre Festival. Curious as to what you think about these Fyre Festival NFTs that are listed? For instance, one NFT is a picture of the cheese sandwich that sold for $80K — What do you think about that sale?Ja Rule: Yeah that’s an interesting story. Well, my painting that I sold, I wanted to get rid of it and get it out of my house, because I have a whole new chapter in my life. That subject doesn’t define me. I wanted the bad juju out of my house. I sold my painting as an NFT which was great. Then the cheese sandwich photo is a very interesting story, because the guy that actually took that picture of the cheese sandwich — This is a guy I should have animosity toward.Because he took a picture of a cheese sandwich, and that was a false narrative to what was being served at the festival. It became like the ‘big joke’ and like reality to a lot of people. Like this is what they were serving on this disaster and then you see the documentary, and the woman is sitting there saying she lost money because she fed all these people, saying this and that, and how she cooked amazing food. It’s like which one is it? Were we serving cheese sandwiches or serving this woman’s amazing food? I don’t know which one it was, because I wasn’t there, obviously.But I’m smart enough to know that if people were being served a cheese sandwich, there would be more than just one picture up. So he came to us with the picture and at first I was against it, because I was like ‘we’re not the Fyre Festival, we’re an auction house.’ We did my painting and it got the company press. It helped kick off the Flipkick company and it is a physical piece of art and a beautiful piece of art, regardless of what it represents. The art [Tripp Derrick Barnes] painted is amazing.So he deserves to have his art displayed and sold like anybody else. He didn’t know this was going to be a disaster when he painted that work of art. The cheese sandwich story is such an amazing story, because this man brought us this cheese sandwich picture and he wanted to sell it and the rights to the picture, because of all the hoopla and whatever Fyre was. At first, I said ‘let’s not do this,’ but then we learned that… and that James and Test (Flipkick.io co-founders James Cropcho and Robert Testagrossa) said that the guy is trying to sell the picture because he needs a new kidney.This changed everything. I said ‘ok I get that’ lets put the picture up and hopefully this guy can sell it and save his life.He then put the picture up on flipkick.io and it didn’t sell. I said ‘ya know Test, this is bigger than just the picture,’ and Test was like ‘Ya know Ja, I agree.’ I said we should buy this picture and save this guy’s life, and that’s just what we did. So I actually own the cheese sandwich picture and Flipkick owns the cheese sandwich picture. The silver lining behind the whole Fyre Festival fiasco is that this man’s life was able to be saved from that picture. I think that’s something people should understand when they look at Ja Rule and say that I wanted to scam people — No, I’m not that guy.No, I’m that other guy, ya understand, the kind of guy that would save a man’s life by buying a picture that tried to destroy my life. That’s the guy I am.I hate when people talk about that incident like I’m such a bad guy, and they don’t even know me or know much about the incident. Whenever people talk about the Fyre Festival, I let them know that I was cleared of all wrongdoing. It wasn’t something that was, for me, intentionally done to be a disaster. And that the guy [Billy McFarland] is serving time for his mistakes. Billy’s in jail and he stood up for everything that he did. He let it be known that Ja Rule didn’t do this and he stood up for that. With that being said, the cheese sandwich picture sold and saved a life, and at the end of the day, there is a silver lining out of that whole fiasco.BCN: A vast number of hip-hop artists, rappers, and other celebrities have been jumping into the NFT industry. Why do you think famous musicians and artists are getting into NFTs?Ja Rule: I think people are really getting into NFTs because of what it is. Here’s the best way I can explain it and I’m going to give credit to my man Carlos Gill who said this to me the other day and I said that’s a very interesting perspective of NFTs. He said ‘It’s like the stock market, country club, and community all in one.’ It’s everything when you look at what NFTs are.Its investment, it’s an amazing sense of community, and a driven space that’s a really great time for NFTs and what they are becoming. It’s really changing people’s lives.BCN: A number of people believe that Bitcoin and NFTs are meant to decentralize the systems that have been corrupted by abusive third parties. What does Ja Rule think about decentralization?Ja Rule: I like decentralization, I like the fact that people can move their money in different ways. This is a currency that people can use across all forums. Not just in America, but in every country and it’s like the world currency for everyone.I like the fact that [bitcoin is] decentralized and that’s what I think really makes bitcoin what it is.BCN: NFTs are expected to be a multi-billion dollar business in the next few years with exponential growth. Do you think that it will grow that valuable?Ja Rule: I do think that will happen. I think the space is really, really small right now. There’s not a lot of people into NFTs and a lot of people are intrigued and want to know more about it. But it’s still very new and a very young space but it’s growing. A lot of celebrities, a lot of people are getting into it because I think they like the sense of community. Being a part of something. It’s like someone came up with an idea to start these small communities to get wealthy within these groups. Like a secret society. I think that’s what people are getting into.For me, I love art. First and foremost I love collecting art and there are some NFT projects where I don’t even read the roadmap before I buy the art. Because I don’t care, I love art and love what I bought. For me, art is in the eye of the beholder. What I like, you may not like. What I see as valuable, you may think is garbage. It’s subjective and so is music so it kind of goes hand in hand and for me, it’s the same thing.What do you think about the Bitcoin.com News interview with Ja Rule?

512,New York IT Supervisor Faces up to 15 Years in Jail for Mining Bitcoin in the Office,"Sep 11, 2021","A New York IT supervisor is facing a possible sentence of up to 15 years in jail for mining bitcoin in the office. The man, identified as Christopher Naples, allegedly had hidden 46 mining rigs in the offices of the Suffolk County Center in Riverhead, New York. According to the investigation, 10 of these rigs had been installed since February, consuming more than $6,000 worth of energy. But given there were 36 more machines, the total energy cost could be far greater.Christopher Naples, an IT technician for Suffolk County in New York, could spend up to 15 years in jail for mining bitcoin in his offices. According to reports, the man introduced 46 mining machines into the offices of the county, hiding these underneath floorboards. Naples is now facing charges of public corruption, grand larceny, computer trespass, and official misconduct.Prosecutors state the machines spent at least $6,000 worth of power, with the temperature of the rooms where the miners were installed rising 20 degrees, affecting the surrounding server rooms and offices. About this, Timothy D. Sini, the Suffolk County district attorney, stated:Not only do we have thousands of dollars of taxpayer money funding this operation, but it also put the county’s infrastructure at risk.The county employees had also complained about the poor performance of the AC units and the slow internet, resources that were shared and used by the mining machines distributed in the office.This is not the first time that an employee of a public office has stolen power to mine cryptocurrencies. There have been multiple cases similar to this one. New York City’s Department of Education has cases dating from 2013 and 2014 where employees tried to mine bitcoin with company equipment.An employee of the Federal Reserve also tried to mine cryptocurrencies using one of the institution’s servers. That employee, Nicholas Berthaume, was fined $5,000 and spent 12 months on probation. In a press meeting, Sini stressed:We will not tolerate county employees, who are already on the public payroll, to steal taxpayer money and illegally use government resources for their own personal gain.Suffolk County Clerk Judith A. Pascale declared that no records of the country were accessed or modified due to the mining activity.What do you think about Naples stealing power to mine bitcoin in public offices?

The joint effort will allow the development of a white label solution, allowing third parties to complete their financial services with bitcoin functionalities without having to develop these systems in-house.NYDIG, a leading fintech solutions company focused on Bitcoin services, has announced a partnership with MVB Bank, a banking-as-a-service provider, to integrate its full bitcoin stack services into its platform. This will allow MVB Bank to offer third parties a full solution that could encompass fiat and bitcoin banking all at once, easing onboarding of its customers to cryptocurrency.MVB Bank currently has over 50 institutional customers among fintech, payments, and gaming companies that use its Victor platform to provide services to their customers. Victor aims to provide an all-in-one solution for financial technology companies, that is adaptable and brandable. Victor’s current customers and its new ones would have the opportunity to add bitcoin services through the platform, without having to do it by themselves.About this, Matt West, CSO of MVB Bank stated:We are thrilled that NYDIG chose to leverage Victor to integrate with MVB and that our developer-friendly APIs accelerated the timeline to launch this exciting program.Until now, very few companies have provided cryptocurrency-as-a service-enabled platforms. This rendered small companies and small banks unable to offer other products due to a lack of manpower to program support for them. NYDIG and MVB’s joint collaboration will produce a solution that allows companies to add their own branding to the product, and offer bitcoin integration in platforms their customers already know and use daily. This is meant to allow a seamless transition to bitcoin services.NYDIG’s CIO, Patrick Sells, reflected about this, stating:Up to this point, only a select few fintech companies have been able to offer Bitcoin products and services, and it has been difficult to achieve. Now the industry has its first turnkey platform to seamlessly deliver white label banking and Bitcoin products side by side.The companies didn’t offer details about when this integration would be ready for testing with customers.What do you think about the new Bitcoin white label services offered by NYDIG and MVB Bank?

514,"Report Says Western Union Could Lose $400M if El Salvador's Chivo Bitcoin Wallet Gains Traction, Tim Berners-Lee Weighs In","Sep 10, 2021","The Republic of El Salvador has made many headlines this week as the country adopted bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday and became the first-known nation-state to purchase the leading crypto asset. A recent report details that remittance providers like Moneygram and Western Union could lose up to $400 million annually if the Chivo wallet is used more. Furthermore, the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee has written an opinion piece about why Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele announced the bitcoin tender law at the Miami bitcoin conference.Ever since El Salvador adopted bitcoin (BTC) as legal currency on September 7, 2021, the country has continued to be a topic of discussion. Bitcoin.com News has reported on the many developments in El Salvador from ‘Bitcoin Beach’ to the ‘30for30’ trend that took place this week. Moreover, the country started buying mass quantities of bitcoin (BTC) before the legalization was implemented. The very next day, during the bitcoin (BTC) market rout, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele said El Salvador “bought the dip.”Additionally, Bitcoin.com News reported on the government bitcoin wallet called Chivo and how the wallet had a number of launch issues during the launch day. However, the following day the ability to download the Chivo wallet was easier and Bukele said the wallet’s maintenance was completed. A recent report published by CNBC explains that if the Chivo wallet happens to gather mass adoption and removes remittance customers from financial institutions they could lose millions.CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos reports that “should the population adopt bitcoin at scale,” there’s a chance that “Western Union and MoneyGram will lose $400 million a year in commissions for remittances.” In El Salvador, remittances make up 50% of a citizen’s total income and they make up close to a quarter of the country’s GDP. Sigalos highlights that roughly 70% of the population in El Salvador receives remittances. Sigalos reached out to Western Union and asked the company if it was worried about this possible transition. The reporter wrote:Western Union did not reply to a CNBC request for comment about whether the company was worried about how this might affect business and if there was any plan to alter the fee structure to adjust for increased competition.In addition to the reports of remittance firms being hurt by the Chivo wallet, numerous individuals have given their two cents on the El Salvador bitcoin adoption subject. On Wednesday, Bitcoin.com News covered the sentiment stemming from the famous whistleblower Edward Snowden as he said competing nations are now under pressure to acquire BTC as El Salvador did. Furthermore, the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee has written about El Salvador adopting bitcoin as well.Berners-Lee is well known for being one of the earliest reporters to cover the subject of bitcoin (BTC) when he wrote articles for Ars Technica. In his latest article published on fullstackeconomics.com discusses why he thinks president Bukele announced the new law at the Miami bitcoin conference. Berners-Lee explains critically and says: “It’s not clear if forcing merchants to adopt bitcoin will actually help people who lack banking services. Bitcoin requires Internet access, which is spotty in many parts of El Salvador. And bitcoin may prove too complex and cumbersome for everyday use,” the inventor of the world wide web stressed.Berners-Lee articulated how the CEO of Strike, Jack Mallers, revealed the news at the conference during an “emotional and profanity-laden address.” Berners-Lee remarked that the announcement was made at an “unorthodox venue” and he highlighted that “Bukele’s own speech was rather vague about how bitcoin would help El Salvador.” The world wide web creator said it was “telling” how Bukele chose to make his announcement. Berners-Lee said:It’s telling that Bukele chose to announce the initiative in English, at a Bitcoin conference in the United States, rather than addressing a domestic audience. One of his goals seems to be to get Bitcoiners around the world—some of whom are quite wealthy—to visit El Salvador and start businesses there.Berners-Lee further said that there’s a chance that by becoming the “world’s most bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction” it just might lead to “a savvy tourism and business development strategy.” But the English computer scientist continued to criticize the concept and noted that Bukele’s experiment could hurt Salvadorans. “At the same time,” Berners-Lee wrote. “You can see why this might rub some Salvadorans the wrong way. Bukele’s experiment will impose real costs on small shopkeepers who may not be in the tourism business and may never see significant bitcoin business.”What do you think about the possibility of the Salvadoran government’s Chivo wallet hurting big remittance providers like Moneygram and Western Union? What do you think about Tim Berners-Lee’s assessment of the bitcoin situation in El Salvador? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

515,"Central Bankers Say Bitcoin Is High Risk Investment, Poor Store of Value, Could Collapse","Sep 9, 2021","Two central bank governors have shared their opinions about bitcoin after the cryptocurrency became legal tender in El Salvador. The governor of the Bank of Mexico sees bitcoin as a high-risk investment and a poor store of value while the governor of Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, believes bitcoin could collapse.The governors of the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) and Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, have shared their views on bitcoin after the cryptocurrency became legal tender in El Salvador.Bank of Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon said Thursday that bitcoin is more like a means of barter than fiat money, Reuters reported, adding that he called the cryptocurrency “a high-risk investment and a poor store of value.” The Banxico governor is an economist; he was appointed by Mexico’s president to serve as governor of the central bank until Dec. 31. He was quoted as saying:Whoever receives bitcoin in exchange for a good or service, we believe that is more akin to bartering because that person is exchanging a good for a good, but not really money for a good.“In our times, money has evolved to be fiat money issued by central banks. Bitcoin is more like a dimension of precious metals than daily legal tender,” he continued.His comments suggest that Mexico will not be adopting bitcoin as a national currency as El Salvador did anytime soon. The Salvadoran Bitcoin Law went into effect on Sept. 7 and BTC is now legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.The Bank of Mexico chief argued that in order for a cryptocurrency to be considered money it must be a reliable payment method. However, he said that cryptocurrencies are very volatile, noting that their values often swing wildly on a daily basis. The Banxico governor elaborated:People will not want their purchasing power, their salary to go up or down 10% from one day to another. You don’t want that volatility for purchasing power. In that sense, it is not a good safeguard of value.Meanwhile, the governor of the Swedish central bank, Stefan Ingves, compared buying and selling bitcoin to trading stamps. Bloomberg reported Thursday that he commented on bitcoin at a banking conference in Stockholm, warning that the cryptocurrency could collapse.Ingves is also an economist. He previously served as Chairman of the Basel Committee and Director of the Monetary and Financial Systems Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He was quoted as saying:Private money usually collapses sooner or later. And sure, you can get rich by trading in bitcoin, but it’s comparable to trading in stamps.The Riksbank governor previously said that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to escape regulatory oversight as their popularity grows.What do you think about the comments by the two central bankers?

Its portfolio managers are Bill Miller and Samantha McLemore.“We have been observers of bitcoin for a long time and during the quarter, the fund received approval to invest in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is an open-ended grantor trust fully invested in bitcoin,” the report details. “In the quarter, as bitcoin fell, the trust traded at one of its larger discounts to its underlying holdings in bitcoin providing additional upside potential.”As of June 20, the fund holds 1.5 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) valued at $44,715,000, the report filed with the SEC shows.The fund managers added, “With gold’s market capitalization greater than $11 trillion, bitcoin’s current cap close to $600 billion would have a long way to go to catch up,” elaborating:We are early in a continuing adoption curve and bitcoin will be volatile but we think the risk-reward is attractive.Veteran investor Bill Miller has long been a bitcoin proponent. In May, when the price of bitcoin fell from $58K level to below $34K, he said it was “pretty routine.” Miller added that the correction was “right in line with moves we have seen many times in bitcoin.” In April, he disagreed with some analysts that bitcoin was in a bubble. Instead, he said bitcoin was entering the mainstream as demand grew faster than supply.Do you agree that bitcoin has significant upside potential as digital gold?

517,"Russia Not Ready for Bitcoin as Legal Tender, Putin’s Spokesman Peskov Says","Sep 8, 2021","Russia has no reason to recognize bitcoin, President Putin’s press secretary has noted after El Salvador became the first country to adopt the digital coin as legal tender. In a statement to the press, Dmitry Peskov revealed he is convinced that such a move would not bring any benefits to the Russian Federation. The government in Moscow sees no reason to recognize bitcoin at this point, according to Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Describing it as a quasi-currency, the Kremlin representative insisted that equating bitcoin to official monetary instruments wouldn’t do anything but harm Russia’s financial and economic system. Speaking to reporters, Peskov emphasized:Clearly, Russia is not ready for such steps.The statement, quoted by RIA Novosti news agency on Tuesday, came as the Republic of El Salvador became the world’s first country to recognize bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender for payments in its jurisdiction. On Sept. 7, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law came into effect, making the leading crypto by market cap a national currency alongside the U.S. dollar, as Bitcoin.com News reported.Residents of the small Central American nation can now pay for goods and services using the cryptocurrency as all prices can be denominated in BTC. Furthermore, taxpayers can use bitcoin to cover their obligations to the state. On Monday, President Nayib Bukele revealed his government had also started purchasing BTC, later announcing that the country had acquired 200 coins, bringing the total it holds to 400, and then “buying the dip” with another 150 coins when the price fell to below $43,000.Russia, on the other hand, is a long way from accepting any cryptocurrency as legal tender. Moscow partially regulated coins and tokens with the new law “On Digital Financial Assets” which entered into force at the beginning of this year. Its provisions recognize cryptocurrencies as property but prohibit their use for payments.According to the country’s current legislation, the national fiat ruble remains the only legal tender, and “money surrogates” are banned in the Russian Federation. Bank of Russia, the country’s central bank which has categorically opposed the adoption of decentralized digital money, is preparing to launch a digital ruble prototype by the end of 2021.Russian media reported in May, however, that members of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, had started working on amendments to the Civil Code that would permit the use of crypto assets as contractual means of payment. If approved, the changes will allow parties to a contract to pay each other with cryptocurrency, only under the terms of their agreement.Do you think Russia will change its position on cryptocurrencies in the future?

He tweeted:Today Bitcoin was formally recognized as legal tender in its first country. Beyond the headlines, there is now pressure on competing nations to acquire bitcoin — even if only as a reserve asset — as its design massively incentivizes early adoption. Latecomers may regret hesitating.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law went into effect on Sept. 7 and BTC is now a national currency alongside the U.S. dollar. Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, also revealed Tuesday that his government has purchased 550 BTC.Snowden is not the only one expecting other countries to follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and adopt bitcoin. Dante Mossi, the executive president of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), said that if adopting bitcoin as legal tender goes well in El Salvador and the cost of remittances drops substantially, “other countries will probably seek that advantage and adopt it.”Even Bank of America sees benefits in adopting bitcoin as legal tender for El Salvador. “Bitcoin could be used as an intermediary for cross-border transfer … Using bitcoin for remittances could potentially reduce transaction costs compared to traditional remittance channels,” the bank wrote in early August. In addition, global investment bank JPMorgan said in June that the move by El Salvador could be “the beginning of a broader trend among similarly situated, smaller nations.”Do you agree with Edward Snowden?

519,Central Bank of Brazil Director States Government Will Know 'Everything You Have in Bitcoin',"Sep 8, 2021","Mauricio Moura, a current director of the Central Bank of Brazil, stated that anonymity won’t be a choice when making cryptocurrency transactions in the country. The representative stated that, sooner or later, all users would have their transactions identified by the government. These comments came at an event promoted by the Institute of Professionals for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing.Mauricio Moura, director of citizenship relations and supervision of conduct for the Central Bank of Brazil, stated that the coming regulation could ban anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions made in the country. Moura stated that the central bank is currently devising ways to achieve this objective jointly with the Brazilian Securities Commission. He declared:I can’t say much. But the names of those involved in cryptocurrency operations will be known end-to-end. I can say that anonymity will not be an option.Currently, all exchanges and companies in Brazil must report their operations and the operations of their customers to the regulator. But some of these companies still aren’t complying with this mandate. Moura didn’t detail how the bank would accomplish the planned objective.Brazil is in the process of issuing a complete regulatory system for cryptocurrency assets, and the Central Bank of Brazil is included in the institutions that have a say in this process. In June, a law project that proposes a fixed period for establishing cryptocurrency regulations was introduced in Congress. While it is still awaiting approval, it would give the government 180 days to propose and approve a system to regulate and tax cryptocurrencies like normal bank transactions.There is another commission that is currently focusing directly on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the Chamber of Deputies. However, even with all these institutions trying to regulate crypto, the market keeps growing, and more companies are integrating crypto-related solutions into their operations.This is the case of Visa, which recently announced it will integrate cryptocurrency solutions with traditional banking. But more importantly, the vice president of new business in Brazil has stated the company will be testing direct bitcoin payments this year. This suggests regulation is not scaring big players still interested in joining the cryptocurrency market or embedding crypto into existing platforms.What do you think about the stance on cryptocurrency transactions that the Central Bank of Brazil has taken?

On Tuesday, President Nayib Bukele said El Salvador bought the dip.El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law came into effect Tuesday, Sept. 7, making BTC a national currency alongside the U.S. dollar.El Salvador has been buying bitcoin ahead of the Bitcoin Law taking effect. President Nayib Bukele announced Monday that his government had started buying bitcoin. “El Salvador has just bought its first 200 coins. Our brokers will be buying a lot more as the deadline approaches,” he wrote. A few hours later, he tweeted: “El Salvador just bought 200 new coins. We now hold 400 bitcoin.”The price of bitcoin was rising leading up to the Bitcoin Law entering into force. However, it dipped around 11:00 a.m. EST on Sept. 7, falling from above $51K to below $43K. At the time of writing, the price stands at about $46,883.After the price dipped, President Bukele tweeted: “Buying the dip. 150 new coins added.”The Salvadoran president followed up with another tweet at 11:25 a.m. EST as the price of bitcoin stabilized at the $46K level. He wrote, “It appears the discount is ending. Thanks for the dip @IMFNews. We saved a million in printed paper,” adding:El Salvador now holds 550 bitcoin.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has spoken against countries adopting bitcoin as legal tender on several occasions. In late August, IMF’s legal counsels said that cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, came with “substantial risks” and are inadvisable as legal tender.Sept. 7 got off to a bumpy start for El Salvador when users complained that the government’s bitcoin wallet app, Chivo, was unavailable on various platforms, including Apple and Huawei. When the app became available on Huawei, it was unable to cope with user registration, Bukele explained, adding that the government decided to unplug it in order to connect to more servers and increase capacity.

521,"Demand for Crypto Mining Rigs in Vietnam Rises With Bitcoin Prices, Report Reveals","Sep 7, 2021","Higher cryptocurrency prices recently have restored interest in digital coin minting in Vietnam. Crypto mining is once again seen as an investment opportunity with other options being limited by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has been affecting the Asian country. Demand for crypto mining equipment has increased in Vietnam following the market recovery that saw the price of BTC moving back above the $50,000 threshold, Vnexpress reported. Prices of hardware used to mint bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have also risen as many Vietnamese miners are now looking to buy mining components.Speaking to the online newspaper, Quang Thuan, owner of several crypto hardware shops in Ho Chi Minh City, noted that a few months ago the mining rig market was gloomy after the leading cryptocurrency fell below $30,000 in July. However, he revealed that his sales have tripled earlier this month compared to the August volumes.Two key factors have facilitated this recovery, according to Le Hung, administrator of a Vietnamese crypto mining group with 80,000 members. “First, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have simultaneously seen price hikes, and miners have started to make profits,” he said in a conversation with the Vietnamese news outlet, further elaborating:Second, the pandemic (Covid-19) has prolonged, reducing investment options, and so more people have opted for coin mining.A crypto entrepreneur from Vietnam’s southern province of Dong Nai provided more insight about the funds needed to start a mining business right now. “It cost me nearly VND3 billion ($130,400) to set up this mine,” said Ngoc Van who recently established an ethereum mining facility. “All rigs are new and stable. I hope I can recoup the investment in six months,” he added.While Vietnamese miners can purchase graphics processing units (GPUs) and assemble their own rigs, they can also buy fully assembled mining machines, including rigs from China, where an ongoing crackdown on the industry has closed numerous mining farms. “On average, a rig is sold for VND30 million ($1,300),” said another owner of a hardware store in Ho Chi Minh City.According to Ngoc Van, however, the best-selling devices are equipped with video cards produced by the leading graphics chip manufacturers AMD and Nvidia, and are more expensive. The prices of these rigs vary between 80 and 100 million Vietnamese dong at the moment, or $3,500 – $4,400. That’s around 5 million dong ($220) higher than in mid-August.Vietnam is yet to properly regulate cryptocurrencies and related business activities. In May this year, the government in Hanoi commissioned a research group for that purpose and the Finance Ministry said it’s conducting an in-depth study of the matter. Cryptos are not recognized as a means of payment and the State Bank of Vietnam has previously issued warnings about the risks of owning, trading, and using them.According to data from Statista released in February, the country had the second-highest rate of cryptocurrency use among 74 surveyed economies, driven by remittances, Vnexpress noted. A poll conducted by Finder in 27 countries showed last month that Vietnam holds the highest percentage of crypto ownership.Do you think Vietnam will eventually recognize cryptocurrencies more broadly and comprehensively regulate bitcoin-related activities?

522,Bitcoin Price Dive-Bombs on the Same Day El Salvador Adopts the Crypto Asset,"Sep 7, 2021","After touching a high of $52,956 on Monday evening, the very next day the price of bitcoin slid to a low of $42,900 at around 11 a.m. (EST). Bitcoin is currently trading for prices between $46K-$47K per unit and down 8% during the last 24 hours.Crypto advocates watched bitcoin tumble in a very short period of time down to $42,900 per BTC on September 7, 2021. The drop was on the same day El Salvador adopted bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in the country. Hovering between the $46K to $47K handle, BTC’s overall market capitalization is $890 billion at the time of writing. There’s $60 billion in global trade volume across a myriad of cryptocurrency trading platforms worldwide.BTC is down more than 8% at the time of writing, and many other digital currency markets also saw significant drops in fiat value on Tuesday. The entire market economy of 10,000+ crypto assets slid over 9% collectively to a low of $2.21 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) slid 9.3% and cardano (ADA) dropped by 10.3% on Tuesday morning. Neo (NEO), zcash (ZEC), and eos (EOS) were the biggest losers during the dip seeing double digit losses. Horizen (ZEN), qtum (QTUM), filecoin (FIL) lost double digits during the slide as well. Coins that were barely affected by the drop in value included crypto assets like fantom (FTM), near (NEAR), and solana (SOL). All three of these crypto-assets saw double-digit 24-hour returns despite the swift drop across crypto markets. At the time of writing, there’s $242 billion in 24-hour volume across the whole crypto economy and tether (USDT) captures $122 billion of that volume at press time. Across the board, stablecoins of all flavors saw a lot more volume on Tuesday than prior days. For now, BTC remains consolidated in the $46K-$47K region and crypto supporters are uncertain as to what will take place next. Of course, as bitcoin prices plummeted, the economist and gold bug Peter Schiff had to throw in his two cents about El Salvador adopting bitcoin. “Welcome to Bitcoin El Salvador,” Schiff said. “Your national ‘currency’ just lost over 15% of its purchasing power in under an hour. Get used to it. Just another perfectly orchestrated pump-and-dump by the Bitcoin whales. Too bad this time they had to sacrifice an entire nation to pull it off,” he added.What do you think about bitcoin’s price dropping on the same day El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender?

The company now holds about 108,992 bitcoins.The Nasdaq-listed software company Microstrategy has avoided making a mistake that could have cost the company multi-billion dollars. CEO Michael Saylor tweeted Sunday:If I had chosen gold instead of bitcoin last year, it would have been a multi-billion dollar mistake. It doesn’t help to diagnose the problem if you don’t choose the right solution.The CEO also posted the return of gold vs. bitcoin. According to his estimation, gold returned -5.88% during the past 12 months while bitcoin returned 376.34%. In addition, the return of gold vs. bitcoin was -80% during the last 12 month period.Microstrategy has made acquiring bitcoin one of its primary goals. The company now hodls about 108,992 BTC.Saylor said earlier this year: “Gold is dead money. Sell your gold, buy bitcoin because other people are going to sell their gold and if you wait until you’ve been front-run by all the hedge funds when they dump their gold, you’re going to be the last person out.”In April, Saylor and Frank Giustra debated about bitcoin vs. gold. The Microstrategy CEO explained at the time that “Diversification makes no sense when there’s a cracked answer to an engineering problem.” He opined: “You will never diversify the metal in an aircraft wing, or the answer to a math problem, or the shape of the ship’s hull, or the oxygen content in a scuba tank. When the cabin depressurizes, you don’t place an oxygen mask on 10% of your family. Money is a winner-take-all competition. There is an answer. Choosing the wrong answer has dire consequences.”Investors have been increasingly buying bitcoin as an alternative to gold. A survey by UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, finds that central bankers see benefits in investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Among respondents, 28% see cryptocurrency as an uncorrelated asset, and “11% would consider it as an alternative to gold.”What do you think about Microstrategy avoiding a multi-billion dollar mistake by choosing to invest in bitcoin instead of gold?

524,El Salvador Starts Mass Buying Bitcoin Ahead of BTC Becoming Legal Tender Tomorrow,"Sep 6, 2021","Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador on Tuesday, Sept. 7. The Salvadoran government has started buying bitcoin ahead of the law taking effect. The first 200 coins have been purchased and “a lot more” are coming, said President Nayib Bukele.El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, announced Monday: “El Salvador has just bought its first 200 coins. Our brokers will be buying a lot more as the deadline approaches.” At the current BTC price of $51,691, the 200 bitcoins are worth about $10.34 million.Bukele also tweeted, “Tomorrow, for the first time in history, all the eyes of the world will be on El Salvador.” The country’s Bitcoin Law, passed in June, will enter into force on Tuesday, Sept. 7. It will make bitcoin legal tender in the country alongside the U.S. dollar. The government recently published a video explaining what to expect.In preparation for bitcoin becoming legal tender, El Salvador’s Congress approved a law on Aug. 31 to create a $150-million fund to facilitate conversions from bitcoin to U.S. dollars. Money for the new fund will be redirected from the finance ministry’s current budget and administered by the state development bank of El Salvador.Meanwhile, a growing number of bitcoin supporters are planning to buy $30 worth of BTC to show their support for El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law. $30 is also the amount that President Bukele promised to give anyone who uses the government’s bitcoin wallet, Chivo.Some people are planning to spend more than $30. Tahini’s Restaurant, for example, said that in support of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law, it will “buy $300 every hour tomorrow.”According to Bukele, about 200 ATMs and 50 bank branches featuring the government’s Chivo wallet are being installed in different parts of the country where users can deposit and withdraw money without paying commissions.Not everyone is keen on bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador, however. A recent national survey shows that seven out of 10 Salvadorans want the Bitcoin Law repealed and as many as nine out of 10 respondents do not have a clear understanding of what bitcoin is.What do you think about El Salvador buying a lot of bitcoin and making the cryptocurrency legal tender? Let us know in the comments section below.

525,'30for30' Bitcoin Solidarity With El Salvador Trend Tries to Convince People to Buy $30 in BTC Tomorrow,"Sep 6, 2021","It’s a big day for El Salvador this Tuesday, as the country’s new legal tender law will be enforced. A great number of bitcoin supporters have plans to purchase $30 worth of bitcoin to show support for the upcoming implementation of the bitcoin tender law. The $30 increment was conceived because Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele has promised $30 worth of free bitcoin to every Salvadoran citizen with a government wallet. On Wednesday, September 7, 2021, El Salvador’s bitcoin tender law will come into play. The monetary shift has the whole world focused on the small Latin American country, because people are very curious as to what will happen after bitcoin becomes legal tender. On June 25, Bitcoin.com News reported on the Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele telling citizens that anyone with a government-backed digital currency wallet will receive $30 worth of free bitcoin. Bukele said at the time:It will be within the Chivo app where we will deposit the equivalent $30 in bitcoin to promote its use in the economy and to give people an incentive to use the application.Now, as there’s less than 24 hours left until the crypto asset becomes legal tender, bitcoin supporters have started a social media trend to get a bunch of people to purchase $30 worth of BTC to show support for Salvadorans. On social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, alongside Reddit posts as well, hashtags like “#30for30” “#buybtctuesday” and “#7septemberbuybtc” have been trending. One specific Reddit post that recently published says: “Buy at least $30 tomorrow at 5 PM EDT (2 PM Pacific, 9 PM GMT).”The post was removed from the Reddit forum r/bitcoin but before it was taken down many people commented on the subject. “Too late, bought $30 now,” one Redditor exclaimed. “Yeah, I thought it was today… I guess I’ll buy more tomorrow too. And every day after,” another Redditor wrote.On Twitter, the commentary is similar as many people on the platform are trying to get bitcoiners to purchase $30 worth of BTC in support of El Salvador’s shift toward bitcoin.Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor also wrote about buying $30 worth of BTC on September 7. “On September 7, El Salvador will officially begin using bitcoin as its national currency alongside the U.S. dollar,” Saylor tweeted. “Every cyber hornet I know is planning to buy $30 in BTC tomorrow in solidarity with the people of El Salvador and their leader Nayib Bukele. Will you join us?” Saylor asked while also sharing a “yes” or “no” survey.At the time of writing, 39,949 Twitter accounts voted on Saylor’s poll and 83.4% said “yes” while 16.6% said “no” to Saylor’s “will you join us” question. One person replied to Saylor’s tweet and said: “I’ll do $300 and you do $3 million.” On Reddit one person said that he didn’t think “it’s gonna impact the price at all. The effect on the price happened when the news was first announced,” he said. However, one person said that buying $30 worth of BTC wasn’t about moving the price of bitcoin. He stressed:It’s not about affecting the price. It’s about recognizing and celebrating a historic moment.What do you think about bitcoiners trying to convince others to purchase $30 worth of bitcoin on September 7?

526,"Bitcoin Quickly Jumps Above the $52K Zone Only to Get Pushed Back, Crypto Economy Climbs 3.5%","Sep 6, 2021","Bitcoin surpassed the $52K handle on Monday morning, as crypto-asset markets have been moving northbound and gathering more fiat value. The overall crypto economy is around $2.45 trillion and it has gained 3.5% during the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, bitcoin charts show a pending golden crossover which to many means the overall market outlook looks bullish. Digital asset markets are in the green today and many crypto assets have seen single to double-digit gains during the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the entire crypto-economy of 10,000+ cryptos in existence is around $2.45 trillion on Monday. Bitcoin (BTC) has gained more than 3.5% today and 6.3% during the last seven days. On Monday morning (EST), BTC surpassed the $52K zone reaching $52,230 per unit. Many assume BTC’s next few months will be bullish and a pending golden cross chart signal indicates this may be the case.Basically, when the short-term moving average jumps over the long-term moving average and starts moving northbound, traders call it a golden cross and assume an upward trend is coming. “On Friday, BTC broke through the resistance of $50,500, paused for the weekend, and exceeded $51,500 on Monday, where it is now struggling to hold on,” Fxpro senior financial analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told Bitcoin.com News.“Actually, Bitcoin has been trading above $50,000 since last week as the bulls managed to keep the rate above the 200-day moving average. In light of this, the price of ‘over fifty’ has become quite common over the past few days,” Kuptsikevich added. The analyst further stressed:Anchoring above this mark will open the way to $60,000 and may become a catalyst for a fully-fledged reversal of the crypto market.Meanwhile, ethereum (ETH) is only up 0.3% today but over the last week, ether has gained 22.2%. ETH hit a high above the $4K handle on September 1, but has been below that region since then. Simon Peters, Etoro’s crypto-asset analyst, says ether is headed toward all-time price highs.“Ether is closing in on all-time highs while bitcoin has reached above $50,000 for the first time since mid-May,” Peters said. “ETH surged in the last week, coming close to breaching the $4,000 level. The crypto asset began the week below $3,200 but rose quickly through the week, reaching $3,981 by Friday. Over the weekend gains have flattened but remain trading in this range,” he added. The Etoro crypto analyst continued:A confluence of factors is contributing to the rising price of ETH. ETH burning, staking, gas fees, transactions, and locked away tokens on defi are all working in concert to support price levels. BTC meanwhile has hit above $50,000 for the first time since mid-May. The crypto asset started the week with falls to below $47,000 before rallying midweek above $50,000. In early trading today BTC has surged again, closing in on $52,000.As bitcoin and ethereum have seen some gains and of course attention, a number of other crypto-assets have seen better returns over the last 24 hours. Coins like quant, omg network, filecoin, ftx token, fantom, qtum, chainlink, mdex, bitcoin cash, and EOS have all seen double-digit 24-hour gains.What do you think about bitcoin and the rest of the crypto economy’s recent improvements?

527,Oil Producers and Bitcoin Miners Meet in Texas to Discuss Cooperative Mining Possibilities,"Sep 6, 2021","A meetup in a vehicle warehouse in Houston served as an encounter point for oil producers and bitcoin miners to talk about possible on-site crypto mining opportunities last week. More than 200 investors attended the meeting to talk about an alliance, that would allow oil producers to make more efficient management of their resources and miners could take advantage of direct sources of energy that would be wasted otherwise.Several oil producers and bitcoin miners met last week in Texas to talk about the possibilities of on-site mining that Texas energy producers could bring for them. The meetup, that happened in a vehicle warehouse in Houston, served as a point of encounter to examine these possibilities. Oil wells that are not so big to build pipelines into their operations usually burn the natural gas pockets encountered on site.However, bitcoin (BTC) mining can provide a better solution. This natural gas can be used to power generators that would feed micro mining operations in each well. This arrangement would bring benefits to both miners and producers and would be also beneficial to the environment, not having to burn this gas to release it into the atmosphere.Parker Lewis, part of the people organizing the meeting, stated to CNBC he was confident in the success of the meetup. He stated:“I just knew Houston would be prime to explode because of the energy connection to mining – if we organized a good meetup.”Hayden Griffin Haby III is the product of the amalgamation of these two worlds. He is an oilman that is also a bitcoin miner. Haby stated that when he understood the return of a bitcoin mining operation, he just had to jump into the bitcoin bandwagon. He stressed:When I heard that you could make this much money for gas instead of just burning it up into the atmosphere, thanks to the whole ‘bitcoin mining thing,’ I couldn’t look away.One of the key targets of Texas’ oilmen is to capture the numerous bitcoin mining entrepreneurs that are still looking to relocate their operations after being ousted from China. Alejandro de la Torre is one of these miners that are still shipping mining rigs from China to the U.S. He declared these miners were in several Pacific ships waiting to be delivered to ports.However, many of these deals are done secretly and aren’t disclosed to the public eye. Some deals are protected by nondisclosure agreements and other players in the space just don’t want to talk about their relationships because it would give competitors in the space an edge.What do you think of the exploitation of on-site energy opportunities by Bitcoin miners?

528,"Analyst Predicts Crypto Bull Market: $100K Bitcoin, $5K Ethereum Is Path of Least Resistance","Sep 5, 2021","Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has affirmed his bitcoin price prediction of $100K, seeing $5K for ethereum as the path of least resistance. He expects the crypto market to thrive in a “refreshed bull market.”Commodity strategist Mike McGlone discussed his price predictions for bitcoin and ethereum in the September edition of Bloomberg Crypto Outlook, published Friday.“Crypto-assets appear in a revived and refreshed bull market with the 2H benefit of a steep discount from previous highs at the start,” he began, adding:We see ethereum on course toward $5,000 and $100,000 for bitcoin. Portfolios of some combination of gold and bonds appear increasingly naked without some bitcoin and ethereum joining the mix.The analyst explained that “diminishing supply” is boosting the price of ETH amid “increasing demand and adoption,” emphasizing that ethereum is the primary denominator for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) “which are gaining traction.”He discussed “the accelerating downward trajectory of new ethereum supply, in the aftermath of the protocol change that began burning coins at the start of August.” McGlone clarified, “For the first time, the 52-week rate-of-change in the amount of new ethereum coins vs. the total outstanding is on track to drop below 4%.”The Bloomberg Intelligence analyst proceeded to describe that bitcoin reaching $100,000 is “highly probable, especially after last year’s supply cut.” He continued: “Post-halving years have seen the greatest appreciation, and 4x in 2021 would be quite tame for the No. 1 crypto compared with 55x in 2013 and 15x in 2017.”Emphasizing that “the bulls are in control,” the analyst asserted that “Having survived correction, crypto assets [are] now poised to thrive.” He elaborated:After enduring a gut-wrenching correction, we see the crypto market more likely to resume its upward trajectory than drop below the 2Q lows.Do you agree with the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst?

529,Can Bitcoin Break Historical September Price Trends? Spike Above $51K Suggests 2021's 9th Month Is Different,"Sep 5, 2021","The price of bitcoin has risen above the $51K zone on Sunday and traders and speculators are curious as to where the price is headed next. Historically, in September, bitcoin prices don’t fare so well and usually get better in October. For this reason, skeptics are not sure if bitcoin’s price will continue to be bullish during the ninth month of the year. So far, however, the end of the first week of September 2021 has been much better in terms of gains. Bitcoin is doing well on Sunday, up 5.4% during the last seven days and 26.3% during the last month. So far it has jumped above the $51K region on Sunday evening (EST), hitting a high of $51,863 per unit.The first week of September is almost over, and so far, BTC is looking real good price-wise but traditionally, the leading crypto asset doesn’t do so well this month. In 2013, BTC was in the red that September after reaching a $240 all-time-high (ATH). It dipped after the previous ATH and was trading for $138 per bitcoin on September 1, 2013.At the end of the month in September 2013, BTC was exchanging hands for $137. But after September, the following months leading up to the end of 2013, BTC’s price skyrocketed to $1,240 per BTC in December. Again in September 2014, BTC was down and during the first week of the month, it was trading for $482.28 per unit.At the end of September 2014, BTC’s price dropped even lower at $377.18 per coin. In September 2015, BTC’s price was much lower than previous months, and swapping for $239 per unit during the first week of the month. The end of September 2015 saw prices even lower at $232 per bitcoin.September 2016 was a decent month for BTC, as the price started making headway toward the bull run of 2017. On September 4, 2016, bitcoin was exchanging hands for $608.63 per coin and it ended the month at $600. From the $600 range to to September 3, 2017, BTC’s price increased a whopping 663.66% to $4,582.96 per unit.The price was lower on September 24, 2017, at the end of the month exchanging hands for $3,682.84 per BTC that day. However, most people know what happened at the end of the year in 2017, as BTC came awfully close to rising above the $20K region.By September 2018, BTC was down again trading for $7,272 per unit during the bear market. BTC’s price was even lower at the end of the month on September 30, 2018, and was trading for $6,625 per unit. BTC managed to gather some steam by the first week of September 2019 and was trading for $9,757 per bitcoin.BTC dipped down lower to $8,104 by the 29th of September 2019. The following year, BTC was trading for $10,280 per coin and by the end of that month in 2020, BTC was $10,775 per unit. Again from here, BTC managed to break the $20K per unit ATH by the year’s end and was over that price in December 2020.Historically, September is not the best month for BTC and once in a while, it does shine in September on rare occasions. Bitcoin is still down 29% from the last ATH five months ago when it hit $64,654 per unit.The trend on Sunday, September 5, 2021, seems a lot different than years prior as bitcoin bulls are attempting to go higher. But with three weeks left in the month, anything can happen in the world of bitcoin markets.What do you think about the current bitcoin market and historical September bitcoin price action? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

530,Bitcoin Market Dominance Dips Down to 40% While Ethereum and Other Crypto Market Caps Swell,"Sep 5, 2021","While bitcoin prices have risen in value during the last two weeks, bitcoin dominance levels have slipped to lows not seen since the June 6 low of 41%, and the dip to 39.97% on May 16, 2021. Depending on the crypto market price aggregator leveraged, bitcoin’s dominance has been between 39.99% to 41.52%. Meanwhile, as bitcoin’s dominance has dropped significantly, crypto-asset markets like ethereum, cardano, binance coin, and tether have seen market dominance, in terms of overall valuation, steadily increase among the 10,000+ coins in existence today.It is well known that between the first time bitcoin (BTC) prices were calculated by market capitalization, and all the way up until February 2017, BTC had more than an 80% market dominance among all the other coins, for a majority of the time.There was an instance in 2014, where BTC dropped to 77.9% in December and again in March 2016 to 76.42%. After the March 2016 dip, there were a few quick instances of dominance levels dipping under 80%, but nothing like what happened in February 2017.On February 19, 2017, BTC’s dominance levels slid from 85.4% to a low of 37.84% in June 2017. From here bitcoin has never managed to move above the 80% handle since then and in September 2019, it rose above the 70% handle but for only a few days.On March 1, 2021, BTC again tapped the 70% handle, but has since lost the market dominance again. One of the biggest markets eating into BTC’s cap is ethereum (ETH), which holds a 19.4% market dominance according to Coingecko stats.Messari.io says ETH’s cap is 19.99% and coinmarketcap.com says the dominance level is 20.1%. Ethereum’s market valuation is around $460 billion on Sunday, September 5, 2021. During the last 24 hours, these three aggregators show BTC’s dominance has fluctuated between 39.99% to 41.52%.Bitcoin’s market valuation at the time of writing on Sunday, September 5, is an aggregate total of around $940 billion. Other coin market caps have seen massive gains and this has furthered their dominance levels, and more specifically the top ten digital currencies by market capitalization. Today, all ten coins in the top ten list command 80% of the entire $2.36 trillion crypto market economy.The top ten markets by market capitalization today include bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA), binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), XRP, solana (SOL), dogecoin (DOGE), polkadot (DOT), and usd coin (USDC).While ADA has more than 4% of the entire crypto-economy in terms of market dominance, BNB has 3.71%. The stablecoin tether is nearing the three percentile mark with 2.98% of the whole crypto economy. XRP is a bit lower than tether at 2.21% and the new top ten contender solana (SOL) has 1.79%.In terms of the remaining top ten coins and the rest of the cryptocurrency market caps below them ($472 billion) are also contributing to the swelling value of the overall $2.36 trillion crypto economy. Crypto coins like fantom (FTM), iota (MIOTA), kusama (KSM), and iost (IOST) all saw significantly-sized double-digit gains during the last seven days.What do you think about bitcoin’s dominance levels dropping to new lows?

531,Scammers Offer Free Bitcoin on Hacked Government Site in Russia as Crypto Fraud Surges,"Sep 5, 2021","Unknown scammers have organized a fake bitcoin giveaway through a Russian government website they hacked. The news of the attack comes after a recent report revealed that damages from crypto-related fraud in Russia have reached $30 million in value in the first half of this year. The main website of the local administration in the Russian city of Ryazan, around 200 km southeast of Moscow, has been targeted by hackers twice in a single day, Rzn.info reported quoted by the crypto news outlet Forklog. The unidentified attackers published an ad offering cryptocurrency to those who download a special application.The scammers initially promised to send 0.025 ВТС to every visitor who installed the app. They later changed the offer to a prize of $1,000 in bitcoin for each of five randomly chosen participants in what was advertised as the “Ryazani online lottery.” Both ads have already disappeared from the mayoral site but the local news outlet published a screenshot of one of the ads.The volume of cryptocurrency-related fraud around the world has increased significantly in 2021. In the first half of the year, losses amounted to an estimated $1.5 billion, which is two to three times more than the total registered during the same period of last year, experts from the IT security company Zecurion told the Russian daily Izvestia.According to the report published earlier this week, the Russian Federation accounts for 2% of the global amount – some $30 million, or almost 2.2 billion rubles. Analysts believe the main reasons for the spike stem from the growing exposure of users to digital assets as well as the desire to make quick profits in an expanding sector with limited regulations, amid volatility in the traditional financial markets. They also expect crypto fraud to continue to rise this year leading up to a 15% annual increase.In July, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced it had identified 146 financial pyramid schemes in the first six months of the year. The number is 1.5 times higher in comparison with the same period of 2020. Fraudsters often lure people with weak financial literacy into investment scams linked to cryptocurrencies or crypto mining, the regulator said. The CBR attributed the surge to the increasing activity of “unfair market participants” and investment demand in Russia.Blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis revealed this week that crypto addresses based in Eastern Europe have sent $815 million of digital currency to scams in a single year. Over half of the money transferred to scam addresses from the region went to the Russia-based Ponzi scheme Finiko. The pyramid was targeting crypto holders in Russian-speaking populations in the former Soviet space with promises of 30% monthly returns before it collapsed in July.Do you agree with experts’ expectations that crypto-related fraud will continue to increase this year? Share your thoughts on the subject in the comments section below.
Lubomir Tassev is a journalist from tech-savvy Eastern Europe who likes Hitchens’s quote: “Being a writer is what I am, rather than what I do.” Besides crypto, blockchain and fintech, international politics and economics are two other sources of inspiration.

532,Bitcoin Legal Tender in 3 Days but Survey Shows 7 Out of 10 Salvadorans Want Bitcoin Law Repealed,"Sep 4, 2021","Bitcoin is becoming legal tender in El Salvador in three days. However, a nationwide survey conducted by the University Institute of Public Opinion (Iudop) shows that seven out of 10 Salvadorans want the government to repeal the Bitcoin Law.The University Institute of Public Opinion (Iudop) in El Salvador conducted a study between Aug. 13 and Aug. 20 of how the public views the country’s upcoming Bitcoin Law. The institute is a research center of the José Simeón Cañas Central American University (UCA). El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law is set to go into effect on Sept. 7, when BTC will be legal tender in the country alongside the U.S. dollar.A total of 1,281 respondents ages 18 and over participated in this national survey that “represents the entire adult population residing in the country,” according to the institute.Out of all the respondents, 62.4% said they were aware of the approval of the Bitcoin Law by the deputies of the current Legislative Assembly on June 9. Within this group, 70% indicated that they either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the government on the Bitcoin Law while 30% agreed or strongly agreed.Meanwhile, the data show that about 70% of all 1,281 respondents have an imprecise notion of what bitcoin is and 20.6% did not know what bitcoin was at all. “Only 4.8% define it correctly as a cryptocurrency,” the study details, adding:Approximately 7 out of 10 Salvadorans believe that the deputies of the Legislative Assembly must repeal the Bitcoin Law.Regarding the potential impact of the Bitcoin Law on El Salvador’s economy, a third of the population believes that prices of goods and services will increase and the overall economic situation will get worse with the use of bitcoin as a legal currency.Furthermore, about eight out of 10 Salvadorans said that they have little or no interest in downloading and using the government’s bitcoin wallet, Chivo.The study concludes:The UCA survey reveals that there is widespread ignorance about bitcoin among the Salvadoran population. According to this opinion study, most of the Salvadoran population have a misguided notion about what bitcoin is.Do you think people who are currently skeptical about bitcoin being legal tender will change their minds once the Bitcoin Law goes into effect?

533,Mastermind of Zimbabwean Bitcoin Pyramid Scheme Vanishes With $6 Million,"Sep 3, 2021","Reports from Zimbabwe suggest that an individual by the name of Martin Mhlanga, who is the mastermind behind the Cryptoshares bitcoin pyramid scheme, has disappeared along with over $6 million in investor funds. In addition to Mhlanga’s disappearance, the individuals thought to be managing Cryptoshares’ social media channels have similarly vanished.As one local report explains, Mhlanga had successfully used a series of unrealistic promises to lure many unsuspecting people into investing. For instance, the report explains that many of the victims had been lured into investing by claims that initial Cryptoshares investors were receiving a monthly membership payment of $2,000. Investors were also promised a payout that is double the amount of the initial investment.Believing that they too would be in line to receive the same monthly payment, some of Mhlanga’s victims are thought to have sold their properties just so they could raise the required money. Others are thought to have borrowed the required initial investment from banks.However, once September 1 — the day investors were supposed to receive their payout — rolled around, it dawned on many Cryptoshares investors that they had been scammed. In fact, as one Twitter user, Tendai Tomu points out, the early signs that the company was collapsing were seen towards the end of August when Cryptoshares was having problems paying investors.While the report suggests that some Cryptoshares investors have reported this fraud to law enforcement, many in Zimbabwe’s crypto space insist such a move will not yield much. They point to other bitcoin pyramid schemes like Bitcoin Interchange, which similarly collapsed after fleecing many investors.Meanwhile, on Twitter, some users like Tendai Tomu are adamant that victims of this latest crypto pyramid scheme will never recover their funds. Tomu said:Sad indeed! I don’t think the funds will be returned because remember he was paying early investors with deposits from new ones so the equation will never balance. The best people can do is to learn from this.Others like lawyer Prosper Mwedzi have suggested reporting the fraud to cryptocurrency exchanges. However, still others insist such scams will recur unless more is done to educate people about the basics of investing.What are your thoughts on this story?

534,"Hashrate Follows Price: Bitcoin Hashrate Jumps 92% in 2 Months, Difficulty Expected to Increase in 4 Days","Sep 3, 2021","Bitcoin prices have improved a great deal in recent times and the network’s hashrate remains higher than it was 67 days ago when it tapped a low of 69 exahash on June 28. Today, statistics show Bitcoin’s hashrate has increased more than 92% since then and the network is due for another increased difficulty change in four days. Bitcoin has risen more than 7% in fiat value during the last seven days and has a market capitalization of over $950 billion on Friday. At press time, three month hashrate stats from coinwarz.com shows BTC’s hashpower has increased a great deal since the end of June.At that time, bitcoin miners from China were facing a crackdown from the government and were forced to relocate to other countries. BTC’s mining difficulty, however, started dropping well before the low drop to 69 exahash per second (EH/s). At the end of May, the difficulty slid by 15.97% and two weeks later another 5.3% decrease took place.After the hashrate shuddered to 69 EH/s, the Bitcoin network saw the largest epoch mining difficulty decrease in the protocol’s lifetime. On July 3, 2021, the mining difficulty decreased by a whopping 27.94 % and two weeks later it dipped again down 4.81% on July 17.After this time, during the course of the rest of July and throughout August, BTC’s price and hashrate saw a great recovery. The July 17, downward difficulty change was followed by the first increase in four consecutive downward shifts as it rose by 6.03% on July 29.Since then, the hashrate has been steady and BTC has seen a total of two increases since the 6.03% rise, and the very last increase jumped by 13.24%. Prior to that significant rise and following the 6% spike, the mining difficulty jumped 7.31% as well.Today, coinwarz.com’s hashrate data shows the BTC network is coasting along at 133 exahash per second. At this current rate, in four days’ time, BTC’s mining difficulty is expected to rise from 17.62 trillion to 17.98 trillion. This would be a 2.07% increase at the time of writing, but depending on the hashrate it could increase or decrease from this point.Today’s top mining pool in terms of BTC hashrate is Antpool with 16.24% of the network or 20.52 EH/s of hashrate. Viabtc follows Antpool with 13.69% of the network’s hashrate or 17.3 EH/s. Then there’s Poolin (11.37%), Btc.com (9.98%), F2pool (9.98%), Foundry USA (9.51%), Binance Pool (9.05%), and unknown hashrate (7.89%).If estimates are correct and there’s a 2.07% difficulty increase in four days, it means since July 31, it’ll possibly be 28.65% more difficult to find a bitcoin (BTC) block in September 2021.What do you think about the steady hashrate and the increased difficulty change slated for four days from now? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

535,Cheap Power Brings Bitcoin Mining Boom to Venezuela as Country Moves Toward Digital Economy,"Sep 3, 2021","The very low power rates in Venezuela have created a powerful incentive to mine Bitcoin for a lucky few that have the capital (and dare) to purchase miners and infrastructure in the country. The rise of digital currencies has created a new industry that uses cheap energy and turns it into precious Bitcoin. In other regional news, Axie Infinity, a play-to-earn game, has created opportunities for the less fortunate ones. The country is going digital because of the possibilities these new tools offer.The cheap cost of electricity is creating opportunities to leverage this resource and turn it into bitcoin, a more scarce and valuable resource. This is what many investors have been doing in the country. Theodoro Toukoumidis, CEO of Doctorminer, a services-oriented Bitcoin mining company, has more than 80 ASICS working non-stop. According to him, all those machines put together cost less than $10 in power monthly.However, each of the mining machines costs approximately $400 dollars, a steep price for a country whose minimum wage doesn’t reach the $10 threshold. In any case, the price of mining goes even higher, with miners having to adapt power infrastructure and make repairs to be able to connect to the aging power grid. Venezuela is a country that went through a power rationing period that left citizens suffering disastrous blackouts back in 2019.The situation has since improved, but there are still analysts worried about the effect that a power shortage could have on the operation of miners. Just last month, authorities in a key Venezuelan state disconnected the power supply to all miners due to their supposedly massive power consumption. These miners have since been reconnected to the power grid, after a delay.Mining has been a regulated and legal activity in Venezuela since Sunacrip, the Venezuelan cryptocurrency watchdog, established it as such last year. To establish mining operations, investors must comply with a series of requirements. Complying with these steps can be a little complicated, but these ensure that, in theory, the government will not take action against them. But experience states otherwise. There have been many stories about authorities visiting miners to extort them due to their activities.In fact, Sunacrip had to clarify miners couldn’t be visited by state security forces without a representative from the institution, to curb the incidence of these questionable visits. But due to this, some miners have decided to carry out their activities hidden from the eye of the regulator. This has resulted in the seizure of thousands of mining machines by the authorities.All of these factors combine to create a climate that seems conducive for the development of a digital economy, allowing some Venezuelans to escape the dire situation the country faces. While most Venezuelans cannot purchase and organize a mining operation, there are other ways to make money in crypto that carry a lower entry cost. Axie Infinity, a play-to-earn game that was launched in 2018, has allowed some Venezuelans to invest and offer scholarships for others to earn while playing the game.Axie Infinity has become so popular that a number of academies offering scholarships for the game have gained notoriety in social networks. Vzlatothemoon, one of these academies, has reached trending status on Twitter several times. A scholarship in Axie means that an investor lends the characters needed to play the game to another player, and they split the earnings. This is now so popular in Venezuela that more than 300 stores are currently accepting SLP, one of the native tokens of the game, as a payment option.What do you think about the digital economy that’s brewing in Venezuela? Tell us in the comments section below.
Sergio is a cryptocurrency journalist based in Venezuela. He describes himself as late to the game, entering the cryptosphere when the price rise happened during December 2017. Having a computer engineering background, living in Venezuela, and being impacted by the cryptocurrency boom at a social level, he offers a different point of view about crypto success and how it helps the unbanked and underserved.

536,"IRS Agent Poses as Bitcoin Trader Called 'Mr. Coins,' Biden's IRS Wants 'Outflow and Inflow' Data From Banks","Sep 2, 2021","Over the last few weeks, Americans have read about the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) upping its tax enforcement to catch cryptocurrency users who have not paid taxes. According to one report, the IRS may get access to bank inflows and outflows via Joe Biden’s American Families Plan. On top of this, another story explains how an IRS agent posed as a bitcoin trader called “Mr. Coins” on the peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace Localcryptos.com in a $180K sting operation.The IRS has been stepping up enforcement against tax evaders and has recently been specifically focused on cryptocurrency transfers. This past April, Forbes contributor Guinevere Moore published a report on how U.S. President Biden’s “American Families Plan” aims to increase IRS enforcement. Essentially, Moore details that America’s financial institutions have always had to report capital gains to the IRS, but under Biden’s plan banks are required to “aggregate account outflows and inflows.”Two days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on how the Biden administration is pushing for global crypto data sharing rules in the $3.5 trillion budget bill. At the end of July, the IRS also modified the digital currency question as the tax agency is more focused on finding taxable crypto transfers.Additionally, the IRS has been actively engaged in sting operations and Forbes associate editor, Thomas Brewster, explained on September 1, how an IRS agent went undercover in a $180K sting operation last year.Brewster said the publication reviewed a search warrant that shows an IRS agent called himself “Mr. Coins” on the P2P marketplace Localcryptos.com. According to the report, Mr. Coins went undercover to bust a darknet market (DNM) drug dealer and conned him into trading $180K in cash for digital assets. Mr. Coins communicated with people via Whatsapp and Wickr and Brewster details that Mr. Coins had a 100% positive feedback rating on the P2P trading platform.The DNM dealer was arrested in July and the report details that no plea has been filed to-date. The suspect’s lawyer, Localcryptos.com, and the IRS all declined to comment on the matter, Brewster said. The charges were filed in the Eastern District of New York and allegedly the suspect was involved with cocaine, cannabis, and “pills and opioids.”What do you think about the IRS upping its enforcement against tax evaders and the Mr. Coins sting operation?

According to reports, he was arrested without a warrant.An IT specialist and founder of Hackerspace San Salvador, Mario Gómez, was briefly detained Wednesday morning. His attorney said there was never an arrest warrant for him. Gomez has been a vocal critic of the upcoming bitcoin law in El Salvador.The National Civil Police of El Salvador (PNC) said they detained Gómez “while investigating financial fraud relating to an email phishing scam,” El Faro publication described. A press officer at the Attorney General’s Office told the publication:They tell me it’s a move by the National Civil Police.

She also said they seized his cell phone.The publication conveyed:Gómez’s mother reported that officers presented no warrant when they stopped him in his car, and told him that if he did not come along, he would be handcuffed. Gómez then told the press that he was unaware of why he had been detained.Otto Flores, the lawyer representing Gómez, later told the press that “Apparently he [Gómez] was only being investigated, the police say it was not an arrest.” He added that the PNC has released his client and taken him home.Flores further said that it was “not clear” why Gomez was handcuffed and taken by the police. He noted that he and his mother were even lied to get them out of their vehicle.The lawyer added: “They [the authorities] do not want to tell us which unit of the Prosecutor’s Office is processing the charges.”Gomez has recently been an outspoken critic of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s plan to make bitcoin a legal tender, pointing out flaws in El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law which will go into effect on Sept. 7.Renata Avila, co-founder of Progressive International, explained that Gomez only “exposed flaws in [the] Bitcoin Law promoted by the government,” elaborating:He is not ‘anti-bitcoin’ but someone carefully exposing the weakness of the initiative.Do you think Mario Gomez’s arrest has anything to do with the upcoming Bitcoin Law?

This followed the company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, stating that bitcoin is a major part of Twitter’s future, hinting that the cryptocurrency will be part of several upcoming products.Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) is reportedly testing a bitcoin tipping feature. This development followed CEO Jack Dorsey hinting in July that bitcoin may be integrated into several products, including Tip Jar. Macrumors reported Tuesday:Twitter’s latest beta update introduces support for providing content creators with bitcoin tips using the ‘Tip Jar’ feature that Twitter introduced earlier this year.“Bitcoin isn’t yet available to select as a tip option for beta users, but code in the beta suggests that Twitter is in the process of rolling it out,” the publication described. “Details in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.”Twitter user Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) tweeted a screenshot of how to receive tips in bitcoin on Twitter. The instruction indicates that a Strike account is required, stating: “We use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices so you’ll need to connect your account to accept bitcoin tips.”Twitter introduced Tip Jar in May. The company explained at the time that “The services you can add today include Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo,” adding that it “takes no cut.”Dorsey said in July that bitcoin is a big part of Twitter’s future, noting that bitcoin is the best candidate for the native currency of the internet. He opined at the time: “If the Internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, Commerce, Subscription, Tip Jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet because of that instead of going down on market-by-market approach.”What do you think about Twitter adding the option of tipping with bitcoin?

539,Seychelles Law Enforcement Receives Request to Probe Transfer of 230K Onecoin Bitcoins,"Sep 1, 2021","The Seychelles Police Financial Crime Investigation Unit (FCIU) recently confirmed receiving a request for an investigation into several transactions linked to the transfer of 230,000 bitcoins. The cryptocurrency is said to be associated with pyramid scam Onecoin. Besides investigating the transfer of the crypto assets, the probe is expected to examine transactions involving cash and property worth $10 billion. According to the Seychelles News Agency, the FCIU’s receipt of the request for an investigation follows the recent discovery of “up to $500 million of Onecoin loot in Dubai bank accounts.”This discovery prompted victims of the pyramid scheme to file claims against Onecoin in London, Dublin, and Brussels. Meanwhile, the same Seychelles News Agency report quotes Tania Potter, the FCIU’s head of legal affairs, explaining the steps the agency plans to take before making a decision. Potter explained:The unit has received quite a number of documents, as part of the complaint, some of which need to undergo a verification process to identify any links to Seychelles and upon completion, a decision on the next step will be taken.According to Potter, once this process is complete, the FCU will proceed to inform the Onecoin victims.In the same report, Potter is quoted outlining the difficulties law enforcement agencies often encounter when attempting to investigate crimes that are committed outside Seychelles by business organizations headquartered in the tiny island nation.“We see that the people who have been defrauded have invested on a platform or with an International Business Company. IBC has a registered agent in Seychelles, transactions however do not happen here so it is difficult for us to go after the person who has facilitated or committed the crime,” she said.What are your thoughts on this story?

540,"Genesis Digital Assets Acquires 20,000 Bitcoin Mining Rigs From Canaan, Company Has Option to Buy 180K More","Aug 31, 2021","The China-based bitcoin ASIC mining machine manufacturer Canaan has announced the company has forged a partnership with Genesis Digital Assets, and the two firms have now signed a deal for a large purchase order. Genesis will buy 20,000 bitcoin miners from Canaan and the mining operation also has the option to purchase an additional 180,000 mining rigs from the Chinese ASIC manufacturer. Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers have made very large sales during the second half of 2020 and into 2021. For instance, in December 2020, Bitcoin.com News reported on Marathon’s record-breaking acquisition of 70,000 high-performance bitcoin miners from Bitmain for $170 million. That same month, Riot Blockchain bought 15,000 Antminers from Bitmain.During the first week of August 2021, Marathon purchased 30,000 miners from Bitmain. Canaan sold 11,760 next-generation A1246 ASIC Avalonminers to a company called Mawson Infrastructure Group in April. At the end of that same month, Genesis Digital Assets purchased $93 million worth of ASICs from Canaan. In mid-June, Genesis revealed it bought 10,000 ASIC bitcoin miners from Canaan.Now Genesis and Canaan have announced the companies have settled on another agreement. According to the announcement on August 31, the mining operation Genesis has purchased 20,000 bitcoin mining machines from the China-based mining rig maker.But the two companies are also looking to settle on the “largest mining machine deal to-date,” as Genesis now has the option to purchase 180,000 ASIC miners from Canaan. The co-founder and executive chairman of Genesis Digital Assets, Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, says the firm hopes to increase the capacity a great deal by 2023.“The Bitcoin mining machines from this latest purchase order are part of our on-going efforts to rapidly scale our bitcoin mining operations in North America and the Nordics where we are focused on energy that comes from renewable sources,” Mirakhmedov said in a statement. “These new machines will dramatically increase our capacity as we work towards our goal to increase our capacity to 1.4 gigawatts by the end of 2023.”Canaan is a publicly-listed firm, which has shares that trade on Nasdaq, and each share on Tuesday is swapping for $9.24 per unit. However, Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) shares have lost 74.61% in value since March 11, 2021, when a single CAN share exchanged hands for $36.40. Nangeng Zhang, the chairman and CEO of Canaan, says the company remains “diligent in helping miner clients” expand.“Since we entered the long-term partnership with Genesis Digital Assets earlier this year, we have reached several great deals,” Zhang said. “This order with an option of future large purchases further solidifies our collaborations and reflects both parties’ confidence in the prospect of the cryptocurrency mining industry,” the Canaan CEO added.What do you think about Canaan’s recent deal with Genesis Digital Assets?

The video features the government’s fee-free crypto wallet, Chivo.The Bitcoin Law in El Salvador will come into effect on Sept. 7 when BTC will become legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele tweeted a video explaining what to expect, including the benefits of using the government’s official crypto wallet, Chivo.According to a translation of the video content posted on Twitter, “Starting September, bitcoin will be legal tender in our country alongside the U.S. dollar,” the video begins. It further details:Using bitcoin is not mandatory. You will have the option of paying and collecting in bitcoin or dollars. All cash transactions, prices, salaries and pensions will continue to be in dollars.“You will have the option to use the government’s wallet for free to make transactions in bitcoin or in dollars at any time of day and without fees. You can also use any other wallet to make your transactions,” the video continues.“With our wallet, you will receive a bitcoin bonus worth $30 USD for you to spend. You will have the option to pay in dollars or bitcoin from your mobile without the need to handle money or sign vouchers. Also, those who collect from you will not need to handle money, a card, or be charged any fees. You will have the option of sending and receiving remittances at any time of day without fees.”The video ends with a message from the government of El Salvador stating that “Using bitcoin is easy and optional.”On Monday, President Bukele tweeted that “There will also be 200 Chivo ATMs” where people can withdraw money without having to pay any commission. “You can buy bitcoin for your Chivo wallet or reload dollars and keep them as dollars in your electronic wallet. You can also withdraw remittances in cash without commissions.”Many countries worldwide are watching to see what will happen when bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador. Dante Mossi, executive president of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), said last week that “Everyone is watching if it goes well for El Salvador and if, for example, the cost of remittances drops substantially.” If so, he expects more countries to follow suit.CABEI is helping El Salvador with the technical implementation of making bitcoin legal tender. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that making bitcoin equivalent to a national currency is inadvisable.What do you think about bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador?

Gurley shared:I have to say I was swayed by the arguments of the ethereum crowd. And so, I’ve taken a personal position.Without specifying how much he invested in ETH, the venture capitalist emphasized that the investment was personal and not for his firm.“I’m swayed by the ethereum crowd,” he reiterated. “The party that’s involved seems to be way more pragmatic. They seem to be open to changes and are basically making several changes which I think will bring down fees and will be very beneficial. The developer community is clearly in the ethereum camp.”The venture capitalist opined:I think there’s a ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] benefit once they move to proof-of-stake versus bitcoin. It seems to me to be the smarter way to play if you’re going to have crypto exposure.Gurley clarified that he’s not a maximalist and he’s not arguing that everyone must have crypto exposure.He also commented on the trading platform Robinhood which recently said that more than half of its revenue came from cryptocurrency and 62% of its crypto revenue came from dogecoin (DOGE). The venture capitalist said this is not a sound business model, adding that he sees Robinhood as more of a casino than an investment platform.What do you think about Bill Gurley’s comments on bitcoin and ethereum?

543,"Billionaire John Paulson Warns Cryptocurrencies Will Be Worthless, Bitcoin Too Volatile to Short","Aug 30, 2021","Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, famed for making a fortune betting against the U.S. housing market, says that cryptocurrencies are a bubble that will prove to be “worthless.” While he sees unlimited downside to crypto, he will not short bitcoin, however. “Even though I could be right over the long term, in the short term, I’d be wiped out,” he explained.John Paulson, the president and portfolio manager of U.S. investment firm Paulson & Co., is an American billionaire hedge fund manager who became world-famous in 2007 by shorting the U.S. housing market. He foresaw the subprime mortgage crisis and bet against mortgage-backed securities by investing in credit default swaps.Paulson shared his views on cryptocurrency and bitcoin on Bloomberg TV Monday in an interview with Carlyle Group founder David Rubenstein.Responding to the question of whether he is a believer in cryptocurrency, Paulson affirmed: “No, I’m not.”He elaborated: “I would say that cryptocurrencies are a bubble. I would describe them as a limited supply of nothing. So to the extent there’s more demand than the limited supply, the price would go up. But to the extent the demand falls, then the price would go down. There’s no intrinsic value to any of the cryptocurrencies except that there’s a limited amount.” The billionaire hedge fund manager added:Cryptocurrencies, regardless of where they’re trading today, will eventually prove to be worthless. Once the exuberance wears off, or liquidity dries up, they will go to zero. I wouldn’t recommend anyone invest in cryptocurrencies.Paulson was further asked “why not put a big short of some type on cryptocurrencies” since he believes that they will become worthless.He explained: “The reason we shorted subprime in size was because it was asymmetrical — shorting a bond at par that has a limited duration that trades at a 1% spread of Treasuries. So you can’t lose more than the spread in the duration.” He continued:In crypto, there’s unlimited downside. So even though I could be right over the long term, in the short term, I’d be wiped out. In the case of bitcoin, it went from $5,000 to $45,000. It’s just too volatile to short.What do you think about John Paulson’s comments on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

544,"Higher Bitcoin Prices Create Resurrection of Old Mining Rigs, Outdated Miners See New Life","Aug 30, 2021","The price of bitcoin has dipped a hair in value this past week, but the crypto asset is still up 14.4% over the course of the last month. Statistics show that Bitcoin’s hashrate has seen a resurgence and because bitcoin’s price has increased, mining profitability and hashrate has followed suit. Today’s top bitcoin mining rig is Microbt’s Whatsminer M30S++ (112 TH/s) but with higher bitcoin profits, older machines like Bitmain’s Antminer S9 have seen a revival as every S9 model is profitable today. The end of August is approaching and over the last month, bitcoin (BTC) prices have increased a great deal. Currently, BTC is over 14% higher in value than it was 30 days ago and this has elevated mining rig profitability.At the time of writing, there’s 124 exahash per second (EH/s) of SHA256 hashrate dedicated to the BTC chain. BTC’s hashrate has risen dramatically after sliding to a low of 69 EH/s on June 28, 2021. Today’s BTC prices mean that a great majority of mining rigs are showing profits even after subtracting the cost of electricity and dealing with today’s mining difficulty.As mentioned above, the 112 terahash per second (TH/s) model crafted by Microbt, the Whatsminer M30S++, is currently profiting by $28.77 with an electrical cost of around $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh). Most bitcoin miners today spend much less than $0.12 per kWh if they are located in regions with cheap power.The second most profitable mining machine today is Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro (110TH/s) as the mining rig can get up to $28.72 per day in profits using the same electrical cost rate. Microbt and Bitmain manufacture the most profitable bitcoin miners on the market today, and the firm Canaan’s products follow behind the two manufacturing giants.Of course, new generation application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) models with the latest semiconductors can see daily profits mining BTC between $10 to $25 per day if they are using 100 TH/s units down to 50 TH/s units. If the $0.12 per kWh is cut in half to $0.06 then a great number of rigs can make close to double these rates.It also means older ASIC machines are profitable today as machines that process less than 50 terahash can pull in small fractions of daily BTC. For instance, the Innosilicon T2 Turbo with 25 TH/s can get around $3 per day using today’s BTC exchange rates and $0.12 per kWh.The old GMO B2 miner that launched in 2018 with 24 TH/s can make around $2.69 per day in profits. At $0.12 per kWh, the Canaan Avalonminer 921 processes around 20 TH/s, and an owner of this rig can get $2.03 per day. Bitmain’s popular mining rig the S9 at one time was estimated to power around 70% of the BTC hashrate.Bitmain’s S9 models saw a resurrection in November 2020 and this month, all S9 models are once again profitable. In fact, they are more profitable than they were back in November 2020, when S9 models made between $0.10 to $0.59 per day in profits.On August 30, 2021, using today’s BTC exchange rate and electrical consumption of around $0.12 per kWh, S9 models between 11.5 TH/s to 16 TH/s can get around $0.74 to $1.85 per day. Of course, the 16-terahash Bitmain Antminer S9 SE is the most profitable S9 model. Other older mining models produced by companies like Bitfury, Bitfily, Ebang, Halong, and more, are seeing profits at today’s BTC prices.Moreover, one would think that the best SHA256 coin to mine is BTC but on Monday, SHA256 blockchains such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoinsv (BSV), and Ecash (XEC) are seeing higher mining profits. Coin Dance statistics show that it is currently 2.9% more profitable to mine bitcoin cash (BCH) today, and 11.3% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoinsv (BSV) blockchain. Ecash (formally BCHA or Bitcoin ABC) is 10.7% more profitable to mine than bitcoin (BTC) on Monday.What do you think about the resurgence of profitability with older bitcoin miners?

546,"IMF: Bitcoin Is Privately Issued Crypto With Substantial Risks, Inadvisable as Legal Tender","Aug 29, 2021","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that crypto assets, like bitcoin, are privately issued with substantial risks, and “Making them equivalent to a national currency is an inadvisable shortcut.” The crypto community disagrees.The International Monetary Fund tweeted about crypto assets on Saturday, asserting that they are privately issued, come with substantial risks, and are inadvisable for use as legal tender. The IMF wrote: “Privately issued cryptoassets like bitcoin come with substantial risks. Making them equivalent to a national currency is an inadvisable shortcut.”The IMF’s tweet references a blog post written on July 26 by two of its legal counsels, as Bitcoin.com News previously reported. In the blog post, titled “Cryptoassets as National Currency? A Step Too Far,” the authors warned of the risks of making bitcoin legal tender as El Salvador did. One of the concerns mentioned was that “monetary policy would lose bite,” since “Central banks cannot set interest rates on a foreign currency.”Many people on social media mocked the IMF for calling bitcoin “privately issued.” One Twitter user pointed out that the IMF is “framing BTC (a public, open-source protocol) as a ‘privately issued’ asset to discredit its legitimacy over national currencies, which are actually privately issued.”Some argued that fiat currencies come with more “substantial risks” than bitcoin. “Government-issued fiat assets like the U.S. dollar come with substantial risks. Especially when they are loaned out by intergovernmental organizations with a history of bankrupting countries,” one Twitter user opined.Noting that bitcoin and crypto are competing as an international reserve asset, a third Twitter user described:The IMF is getting nervous because companies and individuals are diversifying their wealth into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies instead of their special drawing rights (SDR).Some people stated that the IMF is becoming an irrelevant organization. DTAP Capital founder Dan Tapiero predicted: “The IMF won’t exist within 10 years.”What do you think about the IMF’s statement on bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

547,"Plan B's Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin Price Model 'Predicts $100K by Christmas,' S2F Creator Discusses 'Time Model'","Aug 29, 2021","The pseudo-anonymous bitcoin analyst called Plan B gave his 704,000 Twitter followers an update on the notorious stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price model. Plan B stressed on August 27, that the “next months will be key” as he believes the bitcoin S2F model “predicts $100K by Christmas.”Plan B is a popular figure in the bitcoin world as the pseudo-anonymous analyst is well known for his stock-to-flow (S2F) price model. In basic terms, the model quantifies the commodity’s (bitcoin) scarcity and then divides it by yearly issuance (the flow).For quite some time now, Plan B and many other S2F fans have insisted that if the model is correct, BTC could one day reach $100K and in the future, possibly a million U.S. dollars per coin. However, in June and July, bitcoin (BTC) prices pulled back a great deal, after reaching a value of more than $64K per unit.After the price drop, Bitcoin.com News reported on how Plan B was still confident that the bitcoin “bull is not over.” Following the last S2F update, Plan B spoke about his model on August 27th, and gave a prediction.“Bitcoin stock-to-flow model predicts $100K by Christmas,” Plan B tweeted. “Time model (diminishing returns, lengthening cycles) $30K. Next months will be key. Note that color overlay is on-chain signal (not time to halving), indicating we are between bottom (blue) and top (red), in line with S2F,” the pseudo-anonymous analyst added.Intothecryptoverse.com’s Benjamin Cowen replied to Plan B’s August 27 tweet, and said: “The time model just shows the ‘fair value.’ It does not say that the price of bitcoin has to be that price at a certain time. We can move above and below it, like we do with the S2F model.”Plan B responded to Cowen’s statement and said: Of course BTC price can move above and below both models.[The] point is that BTC price is currently ABOVE time model, so it is not illogical to expect lower prices if you follow [the] time model. And [the price of BTC] is BELOW S2F model, so it is logical to expect higher prices if you follow S2F.”Cowen, however, replied further stating:The extension above the time model in terms of percent shows that we should expect it to ultimately extend further than it already has. If we started expecting it to go lower the minute it moved above the fair value, well that would also be irrational.Plan B has been bullish for a long time and Bitcoin.com News has covered the S2F trajectory and the model’s criticisms. The model’s creator has often said that BTC will see six-digit prices and he believes the model is on track. The pseudo-anonymous analyst tweets about S2F regularly among other statistics and figures that are tethered to bitcoin.“Nobody who bought bitcoin and hodled 4+ years (200 weeks) lost money, ever,” Plan B said last week. “Also, both 200wma and realized cap (average cost price of all 18.8M BTC) are at all-time high (ATH).” On August 19, Plan B explain why he prefers the S2F model in contrast to the time model and other estimates.“S2F model: BTC=a*(S2F ratio)^b,” Plan B stated. “Time model: BTC=a*(months from Jan09)^b. Why I prefer S2F model: [It] tells you when price increases: after halvings, [has] more robust parameters (a,b), time not an input variable, S2FX not a time series, interpolation [is] possible, [and its] usable with other assets,” the S2F creator added.What do you think about Plan B’s stock-to-flow update and the call for a $100K by Christmas?

548,Buying Bitcoin and Ether Just Got Easier in Honduras With Cryptocurrency ATM,"Aug 29, 2021","A cryptocurrency ATM has been installed in Honduras where users can buy bitcoin and ether. According to reports, this is the first crypto ATM in the country. Honduras borders El Salvador, where bitcoin is set to become legal tender in a little over a week.A cryptocurrency ATM launched this week in Honduras, Reuters reported Friday. According to reports, this is the first cryptocurrency ATM in the country. It allows users to buy bitcoin and ethereum using the local lempira currency.The Republic of Honduras is a country in Central America. It borders El Salvador, the country which passed a law making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The law is set to go into effect on Sept. 7.The cryptocurrency ATM in Honduras, locally called La Bitcoinera, was installed in an office tower in the capital of Tegucigalpa by Honduran firm TGU Consulting Group.TGU CEO Juan Mayen, the 28-year-old CEO who led the crypto ATM effort, explained that there was no automated way to buy cryptocurrencies until now, stating:You had to do it peer-to-peer, look for someone who … was willing to do it, meet in person and carry x amount of cash, which is very inconvenient and dangerous given the environment in Honduras.The cryptocurrency ATM tracking website Coinatmradar does not currently list any cryptocurrency ATMs for Honduras.Mayen said that he hopes to install more cryptocurrency ATMs. He noted that many software developers in the country are already paid in cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that using cryptocurrency will lower the cost of sending remittances.In 2020, Hondurans living abroad sent $5.7 billion, about 20% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), in remittances.With the upcoming Bitcoin Law going into effect, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said last week that 200 crypto ATMs are being installed.Do you think Honduras should have more cryptocurrency ATMs?

Jack Dorsey has been talking an awful lot about the next steps Square has been taking in order to craft a hardware wallet and decentralized exchange (dex) bitcoin (BTC) platform called TBD. Dorsey tweeted about TBD on Friday and shared commentary from the project’s lead Mike Brock. “We’ve determined @TDB54566975’s direction: help us build an open platform to create a decentralized exchange for [bitcoin],” Dorsey tweeted. The TBD lead’s tweet that was shared said:There’s been a lot of speculation about what TBD is and isn’t. Over the last few weeks our team has been determining what needs to be determined. We wanted to finally share our direction, and we have some questions. We believe bitcoin will be the native currency of the internet. While there are many projects to help make the internet more decentralized, our focus is solely on a sound global monetary system for all. But including all requires a few pieces we think are missing.Brock further said that in order to get bitcoin there are “centralized and custodial services” like Square’s Cash App or Coinbase. He detailed that these platforms can have issues and are not “distributed evenly around the world.”Brock insists this is the problem TBD aims to solve and the platform’s goal is to “make it easy to fund a non-custodial wallet anywhere in the world through a platform to build on- and off-ramps into bitcoin. You can think about this as a [decentralized] exchange for fiat.” Brock added:As we said, this platform will be entirely developed in public, open-source, open-protocol, and any wallet will be able to use. No foundation or governance model that TBD controls. Permissionless or bust.Brock also mentioned leveraging platforms like RSK in order “for this to be Bitcoin-native, top to bottom.” The Lightning Network was also mentioned in Brock’s tweetstorm alongside saying there needs to be a “[solution] for exchange infrastructure between digital assets, like stablecoins.” Dorsey’s other team of developers at Bluesky are also in the midst of creating a decentralized social media service that someday Twitter will adopt.What do you think about Square’s attempt to build a Bitcoin-native dex application called TBD?

It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.Kiyosaki tweeted Tuesday after bitcoin’s price rose past the $50,000 level:Bitcoin to $50,000. Great news for bitcoin holders. Bad news for mom and pop. The primary reason I invest in bitcoin, gold, & silver is because I do not trust our leaders, the Fed, Treasury, nor the stock market. Unfortunately mom and pop who save money do.The Rich Dad Poor Dad author also tweeted about bitcoin Monday. “Bitcoin is booming. Gold is stagnant. Silver is 50% below all time highs. Dollar is dropping,” Kiyosaki wrote, elaborating:Bitcoin has the greatest upside. With dollar dropping, bitcoin and silver are the best investments.Kiyosaki has been advising people to buy bitcoin for quite some time, emphasizing that the dollar is dying.

552,Bitcoin Miners May Face Major Semiconductor Shortage — Sub-16 Nanometer Chip Costs to Rise by 20%,"Aug 25, 2021","Fears of a major semiconductor chip shortage have started to make headlines again as the chips power nearly everything from new cars, phones, computers, and a myriad of other items. Reports stemming from Malaysia show that semiconductor manufacturers are dealing with an uptick in Covid-19 cases and this is plaguing the supply chain. Moreover, the machines that secure the Bitcoin network are also powered by these chips, and semiconductor prices might increase by over 20% in the near future.On August 24, the well known German technology and engineering firm Bosch explained that the semiconductor supply chain is broken, as the world currently faces a major chip shortage. Covid-19 is hurting semiconductor manufacturing hubs like Malaysia that are dealing with the virus. The uptick in coronavirus cases in Malaysia is allegedly causing chip shortages, as major suppliers like STMicroelectronics Nvamong, NXP Semiconductors NV, and Infineon Technologies AG operate chip plants in the country. Despite Taiwan having almost zero Covid-19 cases, a regional report noted that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) could possibly increase the price of wafers by 20%. Unnamed sources stemming from the IC design houses say that TSMC has been notifying major clients that they could see a 10-20% hike on all chips involving sub-16nm process manufacturing. Smartphones, computers, cars, and bitcoin miners leverage sub-16nm process manufacturing and some of the top bitcoin mining rigs use 10nm to 7nm semiconductors.Similar to the way it was months ago, a few of the official websites of some of the top mining rig manufactures indicate that physical mining products are sold out across the board. A few firms do have rigs for sale on the spot, as Bitmain currently has mining rigs for sale that will ship in ten working days after the item is “fully paid.” At press time, the cost of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s is $10,000 per unit. The five other Antminer mining rigs Bitmain has advertised on the website are completely sold out. Every now and then in 2021, firms like Bitmain, Canaan, and Microbt announce large sales to some of the largest mining operations worldwide. The average consumer is forced to buy bitcoin mining rigs via second market providers, ones that usually tack on a significant premium. Meanwhile, a number of car companies are cutting production these days, as firms like BMW, Toyota, and Volkswagen have had major issues accessing chips.Taiwan’s Economy Minister, Wang Mei-Hua, addressed the public on Tuesday and said that Taiwan is doing everything possible to keep the supply chain of semiconductors going strong. Wang told the press that U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk discussed it with him on Monday. “I mentioned that Taiwan is doing its best to assist on the chips,” Wang told the press that day. Over the long term, alongside the fact that the shortage has already tightened supply chains, the effects of the global supply shortage of semiconductors may stall bitcoin mining operations and manufacturers who build these machines. Items like system on chips (SoCs), CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and controllers are likely to cost more going forward if these shortages continue. All of the aforementioned semiconductor products are leveraged by the cryptocurrency ecosystem, in general. What do you think about the global shortage of semiconductors and how it might affect bitcoin miners in the future? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

554,XMR Developer Announces Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swap Capabilities,"Aug 25, 2021","For quite some time, trustless, cross-chain trades called atomic swaps have been a holy grail of sorts and a number of blockchain developers have worked on making them a reality. According to the developers from the Monero project, atomic swaps between bitcoin and monero are now accessible via the COMIT team’s asb software.The Monero project has announced that bitcoin (BTC) monero (XMR) atomic swaps are now available via an implementation created by the COMIT network. The announcement was written by Monero developer Erciccione who explains that the “atomic swap implementation developed by the COMIT team is mature enough to be used on Monero’s network.”The developer’s post comes with instructions on how to leverage the atomic swap protocol and users need to utilize a program developed by the COMIT team called “asb software.” Erciccione also asked people to start testing the protocol and to “let [developers] know if you find any issues.” The developer emphasizes that the software is new and may have “unexpected bugs.” “Be careful and only test with small amounts,” the Monero protocol developer insists.Monero has seen an increase in value since this feature was announced. Year-to-date, monero (XMR) has gained 226% while over the last month, XMR is up 42%. The Monero network is well known for its privacy attributes that are active by default as users do not have the option to send transparent transactions. Obfuscated XMR transactions are delivered by using ring signature technology, “bulletproofs,” and stealth addresses. A number of other privacy-focused coins have also seen significant monthly gains.The atomic swap announcement details that the protocol works over the Tor network so users can gain even more privacy during the swap operation. Erciccione says that in order to find swap providers with liquidity, unstoppableswap.net offers BTC XMR atomic swap services for those who have read up on how to use the protocol properly. Other teams that have advanced atomic swap technology include blockchain projects like Komodo and Zcash.What do you think about the bitcoin to monero atomic swap protocol?

556,Second Largest U.S. Mortgage Lender to Take Bitcoin Payments,"Aug 24, 2021","United Wholesale Mortgage, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., announced it had plans to accept cryptocurrency as payment for mortgage loans last week. The company expects to accept bitcoin as soon as Q3 2021, and is looking into possibly accepting ether and other cryptocurrencies as well. However, it is unclear if the company will hold the cryptocurrency collected as is.United Wholesale Mortgage will start taking crypto payments sometime in Q3, according to statements made during its earnings call last week. The company will start taking bitcoin payments first, and is researching in consideration of adding ether and other cryptocurrencies later. Its CEO, Mat Ishbia, stated:We’ve evaluated the feasibility, and we’re looking forward to being the first mortgage company in America to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments.The company, which emerged as a result of a SPAC merger in January, is not directly connected to customers. Instead, it uses brokers to link customers and loans. The company didn’t explain if the cryptocurrency received would be kept as such or exchanged for fiat money.If the company manages to achieve its goal, we might see mortgages paid in crypto before the end of this year. The cryptocurrency payments space has been warming up all this year due to the heightened interest in digital assets. In March, one of the biggest payment processors, Paypal, introduced a new feature called “Checkout with crypto,” which enables users to pay with cryptocurrency in millions of online stores.However, there is still a roadblock for the adoption of cryptocurrency payments in the U.S. Cryptocurrency can be considered property in the country, and paying with crypto can be considered a sale. This means that depending on the buying price, crypto holders might have to pay capital gains tax even when using bitcoin to pay for their mortgage loans.In other countries with less stringent regulations, crypto is already used for real estate payments. This is the case in Venezuela, which recently recorded one of its first public sales of a property paid for with cryptocurrency. This payment method is said to have many advantages such as not depending on the approval of banks, cutting paperwork, and slashing processing times from two weeks to just hours.What do you think of paying mortgage loans with cryptocurrency?

557,Liti Capital’s Wrapped LITI (wLITI) Lists on Bitcoin.com Exchange,"Aug 24, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. Geneva, Switzerland, August 24, 2021 – Liti Capital’s wLITI token, a wrapped version of the Swiss company’s LITI equity token, has been listed on the Bitcoin.com Exchange on 24 August at 10:00AM UTC. wLITI is trading with BTC and USDT pairs.Liti Capital, a Swiss-based blockchain private equity fund specializing in raising capital for legal cases, is making waves in traditional investing by bringing litigation financing to the masses, an investment practice traditionally monopolized by hedge fund heavyweights and elite investors.Just last week, 19 August 2021, Liti Capital announced that it was funding a claim (www.binanceclaim.com) against Binance, which would enable affected individuals to pursue claims, including, if necessary, in arbitration, for compensation in relation to the exchange failing on 19 May 2021. This failure resulted in the trading accounts (including Futures, Margin, and Leveraged Token products) of at least 700 and potentially thousands of individuals being effectively untradeable for hours, causing traders to suffer losses that could exceed one hundred million dollars.Litigation financing is the practice of bringing in investors to cover the cost of a lawsuit or arbitration in exchange for a portion of the profit. Litigation financing specialists, such as Liti Capital, purchase litigation assets for cases they deem to have a high chance of winning.While litigation financing often requires an initial investment of $500,000 to $1 million from an investor, Liti Capital makes it accessible for anyone with as little as $50. It does this by tokenizing shares in Liti Capital and paying out dividends to Liti Capital (LITI) equity token holders when a case in Liti Capital’s portfolio is won.Liti Capital has already secured a healthy case portfolio with its largest case potentially worth more than $1 billion when it finally settles. Cases like these, which tend to be commercial rather than consumer or personal lawsuits, usually target large-scale corporate disputes valued at more than $10 million. While they could take years before a settlement is reached, successful litigation funders can expect to pocket between three and five times their initial investments, according to estimates by litigation finance expert Steven Friel.What is wLITI?wLITI is an ERC-20 token that is the wrapped version of the LITI equity token. Launched on June 29, 2021, the wLITI token is suitable for trading on exchanges such as Bitcoin.com, whereas the LITI token is only available through liticapital.com after meeting KYC requirements. Liti Capital uses the blockchain to manage its share registry. Development of its own blockchain-based case management tools is on its roadmap.Switzerland-based Liti Capital creates wLITI at a LITI token buyer’s request via Liti Capital’s app or website, which converts the LITI to wLITI at a 1:5000 ratio. The tokens will always maintain this ratio. The buyer is then able to trade their wLITI freely. Liti Capital does not directly sell wLITI.LITI is a true digital share of Liti Capital that has voting rights, pays dividends and is protected under Swiss law. LITI is purposely not designed to be on exchanges at this time.Both tokens represent Liti Capital, whose mantra is “private equity for all.” Liti Capital works exclusively in a single form of private equity – Litigation Finance, also called third party funding. This asset class has remained almost entirely exclusive to hedge funds and venture capitalists since its inception several decades ago. Litigation Finance is the practice of financing all or part of a legal case on behalf of a plaintiff for an agreed upon percentage of the court award. Once Liti Capital purchases a portion of ownership of a case, it provides capital that can be used in many ways: legal fees, case management and strategy, expert witnesses, intelligence work and whatever else is needed to give the plaintiff the best chance of winning the case and collecting the award. The portion owned by Liti Capital becomes a “litigation asset” that backs the LITI token.A Strong EndorsementDanish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com Exchange, shared his views on wLiti’s listing, saying,“The Liti Capital team are providing an equity token which is the first of its kind, focused around easy-to-access private equity investment opportunities for basically anyone with the help of blockchain technology.”
Chaudhry continues on by saying: “We’re very excited to see how Liti Capital will continue to empower their vision, and gain further outreach with our outstanding community at the exchange.”Jonas Rey, CEO of Liti Capital, said, “Listing on Bitcoin.com Exchange is an excellent opportunity for us, and a milestone we are proud of. We have full confidence that once the public discovers just how valuable the litigation assets we are able to purchase on behalf of LITI investors are and how powerful blockchain-backed private equity trading can be, that wLITI will become a very popular token indeed.” Listing detailsTrading Opening:  Aug. 24, 2021, 10:00AM UTCDeposit Opening:  Aug 24, 2021, 09:00AM UTCTrading Pairs:  wLITI/BTCwLITI/USDT About Bitcoin.com ExchangeThe mission of Bitcoin.com Exchange is to empower people from all over the world to trade cryptocurrencies with ease and confidence, from first-time traders to advanced trading professionals. With high liquidity, 24/7 multilingual support and dozens of trading pairs, complemented with a high level of security, we offer an attractive platform for trading any cryptocurrency. Within one year since launch, on average, the exchange has been visited by more than 500K active traders per month, and this number continues to grow by the minute. About Liti CapitalSwitzerland-based Liti Capital is a Swiss limited liability company specializing in litigation finance and fintech. Liti Capital buys litigation assets to fund lawsuits and provides a complete strategic solution along with connections to top law firms to help clients win their cases. Tokenized shares of the company lower the barrier of entry for retail investors and give token holders a vote in the company’s decision-making process. Dividends are distributed to LITI token holders upon the success of the plaintiff. Jonas Rey, co-founder of Liti Capital, also heads Athena Intelligence, one of the most successful intelligence agencies in Switzerland. His two co-founders, Andy Christen and Jaime Delgado, bring operational, innovation and technical skills to round out the leadership team. Liti Capital recently onboarded seasoned industry leader David Kay as chief information officer and executive chairman. Boasting more than a decade of experience as funding partner and portfolio manager of a billion-dollar private equity fund in the litigation financing space, Kay successfully enforced what was at the time the largest international arbitration award in history, bringing in over $1 billion in cash and securities. This is a press release.

559,Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele Promises Bitcoin Law Won't Be Forced on Citizens,"Aug 24, 2021","On August 23, the president of El Salvador spoke about the upcoming bitcoin tender law set to take effect on September 7. Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele said that bitcoin will not be mandated by force and “if they want” they can accept bitcoin and they can say “no” if they are not interested in using the cryptocurrency. In just over two weeks or 15 days, the bitcoin tender law in El Salvador should take effect. Since the supermajority in the Salvadoran congress passed the law, there’s been a lot of speculation as to whether or not it will work out.Nayib Bukele tweeted about the matter on August 23, 2021, and explained to his 2.8 million Twitter followers that the bitcoin law would not be mandatory. There’s been a lot of criticism toward the law possibly forcing citizens to use bitcoin (BTC) against their will.“This will be what happens on September 7,” Bukele said. “People will be able to download an application to receive payments or gifts in bitcoin or U.S. dollars. If they want they will download the app, and if they don’t want to, no,” the Salvadoran president added. Bukele added:“With this application, you can accept payments in bitcoin or in DOLLARS, open a small business and run it from there, receive money from family or friends and send and receive remittances without paying a single penny of commission to anyone.”Ever since El Salvador’s president initiated the idea of legalizing bitcoin as the Salvadoran national tender, opinions have surfaced about the country’s choice. Bank of America outlined a few benefits El Salvador could see by adopting BTC while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave some negative sentiment toward the idea.A group of Salvadorans protested the new law and a survey conducted in July had shown a majority of Salvadorans said they were skeptical of bitcoin as a currency. Just recently, one of the Big Three credit rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, published a report on why the credit agency does not think adopting bitcoin is a good idea.Bukele’s tweetstorm on Monday, makes it sound like things will be all gravy, and he stressed that if Salvadorans wanted to “go to the Western Union queue and pay commission. There is no problem.” Bukele also emphasized that a “Salvadoran abroad will be able to send money INSTANTLY to their relatives in El Salvador.”Bukele added:All the bitcoin that you receive will be automatically converted into dollars (if you wish) and you can leave it in your electronic wallet or withdraw it in cash at any of the 200 ATMs that will be everywhere. There will also be 50 branches to withdraw or deposit money. The #Puntos Chivo they are being built everywhere. There they will be able to receive help on how to use the application, how [to use] bitcoin, how to withdraw or deposit money, how to use ATMs, and how to receive money from anywhere in the world.Bukele also shared a photograph of a great number of bitcoin automated teller machines (ATMs) ready to be deployed.“There will also be [ATMs] everywhere and you can withdraw in CASH, 24 hours a day and WITHOUT COMMISSIONS, even if the opposition says otherwise,” Bukele insisted. “The problem for them is that they will be able to convince some people that there will be commissions, but only until the 7th.”What do you think about the president of El Salvador’s latest tweetstorm about the bitcoin law and how he stressed it won’t be mandated?

563,Swedish Government to Return 33 Bitcoin to Drug Dealer in Landmark Case,"Aug 23, 2021","The Swedish government must return 33 bitcoin, worth more than $1.5 million, to a drug dealer in the first cryptocurrency seizure case in the country. The prosecutor of the case, who achieved the seizure of the cryptocurrency due to its illegal origin, recorded the seized amount in dollars, and due to price fluctuations, the government must reimburse the mentioned amount. The case might have repercussions in future cases.The Swedish government must reimburse 33 bitcoin, worth more than $1.5 million dollars, to a drug dealer in a case that might have repercussions for similar future cases. The drug dealer was arrested two years ago by the Swedish Enforcement Authority, and 36 bitcoin were seized from him at that time. Tove Kullberg, the prosecutor that took the case, argued that the whole bitcoin stash had a criminal origin, and managed to seize the crypto.However, Kullberg used the number of dollars in his case instead of the amount of cryptocurrency. Since then, the price of the bitcoin has grown enormously, causing the value of the bitcoin seized to keep growing, while the recorded amount seized stayed the same. Only 3 bitcoin were sold to pay for the amount seized.This consideration has led the Swedish government to pay the difference to the drug dealer now that he has been released, even knowing the cryptocurrency was linked with illegal origins. Kullberg stated:The lesson to be learned from this is to keep the value in bitcoin, that the profit from the crime should be 36 bitcoin, regardless of what value bitcoin has at the time. It has led to consequences I was not able to foresee at the time.The prosecutor qualified the event as “unfortunate” and it shows the consequence of a lack of expertise when dealing with cryptocurrencies linked to criminal acts. Further, this case could act as jurisprudence for future cases, a strange turn of events for Swedish law.Kullberg acknowledged his mistake, is now supporting investing in education for the prosecution on cryptocurrency matters. About this, he stated:I think we should probably invest in an internal education in the authority, as cryptocurrency will be a factor we’ll be dealing with to a much greater extent than we are today. The more we increase the level of knowledge within the organization, the fewer mistakes we will make.What do you think about the Swedish government bitcoin reimbursement to a drug dealer?

564,"Bitcoin's Price Revival Sparks 'Double Top' Speculation, Crypto Community Expects Another BTC Price High","Aug 22, 2021","The price of bitcoin has reached a value not seen since May 15 and a number of traders and analysts believe the market will see a double top. The scenario where bitcoin rises above the $64K all-time high (ATH) and spikes to another ATH after a long and bearish technical reversal pattern.On April 14, 2021, the price of bitcoin (BTC) touched an ATH of $64,654 per unit four months ago. The price has been between 29 to 31% lower than the ATH but has been rallying back to that position in recent times.Year-to-date, BTC is up 326.6% and it gained 51.6% in the last month alone. While the bearish cycle has taken a touch over three months, during that time a number of proponents and analysts said the bull might not be over. Furthermore, some have alluded that 2021’s bitcoin bull run is similar to the 2013 bull run that saw a double top pattern.This conversation has continued to be topical as BTC has crossed new price levels during the last month and values not seen in 98 days. Essentially, after a long bearish consolidation period, the crypto asset taps two consecutive price highs with a modest reduction in value before the final high.Technically this is what happened back in 2013, as BTC touched its first high of $255 per coin in April, but the following months BTC dropped as low as $70 per unit. Ultimately in December 2013, bitcoin (BTC) touched an ATH of $1,150 per unit before it went into another bear cycle. On Twitter and cryptocurrency forums, discussions concerning a double top in 2021 have been very topical.Crypto fans have littered Twitter with thoughts on this subject on how BTC could rally to all new price highs. On August 20, the Uphold official Twitter account asked:Double Bubble? Traders are watching for signs of a coming second top for bitcoin in 2021, a la the 2013 double top bull cycle. Do you think it’ll happen?The founder of Capriole Investments, Charles Edwards, shared a chart that shows: “New evidence for a bitcoin double bubble. In prior cycle tops, bounces were never able to hold unrealized profit and loss above 0.5.”The crypto fear and greed index hosted on alternative.me indicates the market has a score of 76 or “extreme greed.” Furthermore BTC/USD short positions this weekend are significantly lower than in mid-July. BTC/USD long positions, on the other hand, are much higher at the time of writing.Do you expect a double bubble or bitcoin to jump above the previous ATH this year?

565,"Free Bitcoin: Mayor of This US City Raising Funds to Give All Residents $1,000 in BTC","Aug 21, 2021","The mayor of Cool Valley, a city in the U.S. state of Missouri, is raising funds in order to give bitcoin to all residents in his city. However, he does not want them to sell their bitcoin immediately, noting that when the price of the cryptocurrency is $500,000 per coin years later, people are “going to really regret” selling.Cool Valley is a small U.S. city in St. Louis County, Missouri, with a population of about 1,500. The city mayor, however, has an ambitious plan to make residents of his city wealthy, and it involves giving everyone bitcoin.Cool Valley Mayor Jayson Stewart shared his plans on Thursday in an interview with KSDK, an NBC-affiliated television station. Noting that he is raising funds to put bitcoin in the hands of every inhabitant of the city, the mayor said:It’s digital gold. I would like to see every single household in my city receive some level of bitcoin, whether it be $500 or $1,000.“I have friends whose lives have been completely changed, like going from working a regular nine to five job to being worth over 80 million dollars in a matter of a few years,” added Mayor Stewart, who calls himself an entrepreneur and environmentalist.He revealed that most of the money to fund his bitcoin giveaway plan will come from several unnamed BTC investors, elaborating:I have some very supportive donors who have agreed to match any money that I raise up to several millions of dollars. I’m trying to get a few government funds as well to go along with that, or potentially some of the relief money that comes in from the Covid relief.When asked whether city funds would also be used, Mayor Stewart replied: “It’s possible. We’ll see how it goes.”The mayor does not want residents to sell their bitcoin soon after receiving it, however. To prevent this from happening, he said: “We’re putting in place, like, a vesting schedule for bitcoin. The idea is that maybe you don’t touch it for five years before you really get full access to it.” Mayor Stewart clarified:We’re working on ideas like that because that’s my number one concern. [If] Someone just sells their bitcoin to pay their car note, and then when bitcoin is sitting at like $500,000 all these years later, they’re going to really regret that.The media outlet spoke with a dozen residents of Cool Valley about the mayor’s bitcoin idea. While some of them had never heard of bitcoin or cryptocurrency, they seem receptive to the plan.Ramona Nickels, a mail carrier who lives in Cool Valley, said: “My daughter says she thinks it’s the next big thing, the digital currency … With cash people have bad habits and they buy things they shouldn’t be buying. But with bitcoin, maybe you can give it to your kids. My daughter is going to college next year. I could give [bitcoin] to her.”“Putting money in my pocket sounds pretty good to me,” said Cornelius Webb, another resident of Cool Valley.Mayor Stewart opined:I believe that Cool Valley is going to get wealthier and wealthier, not just our city, but the actual people who live here.Addressing environmental concerns that some people associate with bitcoin, Mayor Stewart said his city will take proactive measures to offset the known environmental impact of the cryptocurrency. “We’re giving away bitcoin and at the same time we’re converting our entire city to solar, like all of the government lights and things like that,” he described.The mayor also talked about some of the plans to get residents familiar with cryptocurrency, including offering free classes about how to use and securely store bitcoin. Stewart hopes to kick things off by the end of the year.Meanwhile, some cities in the U.S. are trying to become bitcoin hubs, including Miami, Florida, and Jackson, Tennessee. The mayors of the two cities are trying to get their local governments to accept bitcoin for payments and potentially keep BTC on their balance sheets.What do you think about Mayor Stewart’s idea of giving all residents $1,000 in bitcoin?

The two companies have officially launched the new service following a pilot program.Zug-based crypto-financial services provider Bitcoin Suisse and Worldline, a European payments company, have announced the launch of an integrated service allowing companies in Switzerland to accept major cryptocurrencies. More than 85,000 merchants in the Worldline network have been enabled to employ the “omnichannel crypto payment solution.”Swiss merchants using Worldline’s point-of-sale and e-commerce payment services can offer their clients the option to pay with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), alongside traditional payment methods. They are protected from exposure to market volatility as the cryptocurrency is converted into Swiss francs immediately after payments are confirmed, a press release revealed, detailing:Merchants can easily download the WL Crypto Payments mobile app or conveniently install the Worldline payment plugin for their webshop. Clients paying with crypto may do so through their usual mobile crypto wallet application.The two firms further explained the platform allows prices displayed in CHF to be quoted in BTC or ETH as soon as any of the coin options are selected. The customer can then pay with cryptocurrency while the merchant will receive instant confirmation of the transaction.Worldline Switzerland CEO Marc Schluep stated that the launch of the crypto acceptance service indicates that the Bezons, France-headquartered company wants to “bring tangible value to merchants across the globe and to facilitate smooth and modern payments in all the markets” where it operates. Bitcoin Suisse CEO Arthur Vayloyan described it as a “historic milestone for crypto adoption” in the Alpine nation, emphasizing:This step proves once again that Switzerland is a leader in collaborative innovation and a pioneer in the crypto and blockchain industry.Worldline and Bitcoin Suisse announced their collaboration on the joint crypto payments project for the Swiss market almost two years ago.

He has publicly advised people to “stay away” from cryptocurrency.On the same day, NYDIG also registered with the SEC a bitcoin fund in collaboration with American financial services company Wells Fargo. The issuer is “FS NYDIG Bitcoin Fund I, LP.”The filing states that Wells Fargo Clearing Services LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network LLC “will receive certain placement and servicing fees with respect to clients they refer to the issuer.”Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Wells Fargo reportedly confirmed that the company has started offering cryptocurrency exposure to its wealth management clients.However, both the filings for JPMorgan’s bitcoin fund and Wells Fargo’s bitcoin fund state that the first sale has yet to occur.What do you think about JPMorgan and Wells Fargo launching bitcoin funds?

570,Australian Police Seize $8.4 Million in Bitcoin Possibly Linked to Silk Road Marketplace,"Aug 20, 2021","According to a recent report, law enforcement authorities from Victoria, Australia have seized $8.49 million in crypto assets. The seizure stemmed from a darknet market investigation that ultimately led to uncovering “drug trafficking on a dark web platform dating back to 2012.”On August 20, the writer for the publication the Age, Simone Fox Koob explained how law enforcement from Australia, specifically the state of Victoria, seized $8.49 million in crypto assets believed to be bitcoin. Two Victorians obtained a massive stash of bitcoin, cash and drugs. The police believe the duo might be connected to the Silk Road marketplace.Law and drug enforcement agents arrested a 31-year old woman from Kinglake, north of Melbourne, and a 30-year-old man from Preston, according to Koob’s report. Police seized a stash of drugs including marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, MDMA, and prescription drugs as well. Koob notes that the couple was released pending “further inquiries” but the woman faces cannabis charges.According to the Age report, Australian law enforcement has been investigating the couple’s alleged usage of the original Silk Road marketplace. The pair of suspects were “associates,” Koob’s report detailed and they amassed “significant wealth.” The report also notes that two properties located in Kinglake and Dollar were also forfeited to law enforcement and the combined value of both properties was $2 million.Law enforcement also took $2.6 million in cash stored in the couple’s banks and two vehicles that were worth around $100K. A member of Victoria Police’s crime command, commander Mick Frewen, told the Age that the pair were ordinary people. “These people have not come to police notice at all. They’ve amassed extensive wealth all from the keyboard in their own living room,” Frewen emphasized. The law enforcement commander added:They are just completely anonymous individuals in the community … I would describe them as quite unremarkable in every way. They don’t ordinarily get associated with overt displays of wealth, [or have a] connection to any organised crime gang or network.Frewen further stressed that the investigation will take some time and law enforcement needs to cross jurisdictions and get information on specific platforms. The couple faces upwards of 10 years in prison for the offenses and the female must appear in court for the narcotics possession charges.What do you think about Australian law enforcement seizing $8.49 million in crypto assets?

571,"S2F Creator Envisions a '2nd Leg of This Bitcoin Bull Market,' Onchain Data Shows BTC Accumulation","Aug 20, 2021","On Friday, the price of bitcoin jumped above the $49K zone jumping 6.6% during the last 24 hours. 30-day statistics show the value of bitcoin has swelled by 50% over the last month and many believe the bull run is not over. Three days ago, the popular stock-to-flow (S2F) creator Plan B shared an S2F chart that indicates a possible “2nd leg of this bull market.” Bitcoin (BTC) has gained over 6.6% today and jumped to a daily high of $49,164 per unit at the time of writing. The leading crypto asset is up 51% since last month and there’s $37.5 billion in global BTC trades today.Last week, Bitcoin.com News reported on the stock-to-flow (S2F) creator Plan B and how he explained that he was confident in his previous forecast. Plan B stressed at the time that the “bull is not over and 64K was not the top.” On August 17, Plan B also shared the same type of optimism.“Both bitcoin S2F (white line) and on-chain signal (color, not red yet) still indicating a 2nd leg of this bull market,” Plan B wrote. Following this statement, Plan B was asked: “Are we shooting for $288k again? Or still $100k? I’m confused.” The S2F analyst replied and said:IMO we are going up, first to 100k, then 288k.Onchain data currently shows there’s been a lot of bitcoin (BTC) accumulation according to Intotheblock’s (ITBs) 50+ onchain indicators.“Since February 2021, the number of addresses holding at least one bitcoin declined by 40,000, beginning when prices first reached $50,000 and accelerating in June as prices dipped below $30,000,” Intotheblock’s onchain insights detail. “This likely shows addresses first taking profits and then potentially some of the panic-selling into the crash,” the researchers added. The Intotheblock research team further said:This trend has taken a quick turn in the opposite direction as the number of addresses holding one or more bitcoin is back above 800,000, pointing to renewed interest and accumulation of holders to reach a full bitcoin. A similar pattern can be observed in the volume held by addresses with over 1,000 bitcoin.In the same Twitter thread, Plan B was asked “why people [are] still saying it’s a bull, while 90% of the traders are [at a] loss?” Plan B responded and said: “[Bitcoin] is up 4x since a year ago, investors are in profit. 90% of traders are always in loss in any market because they trade too much and are killed by cost, or they have no system and are killed by emotions, or they are killed by hedge fund trading desks. Odds are against trading,” the analyst concluded.What do you think about Plan B’s assessment of bitcoin’s future prices and the possibility of a ‘2nd leg of this bull market?’ Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

572,Salvadoran Finance Minister States Bitcoin Use Will Be Optional,"Aug 19, 2021","Alejandro Zelaya, the Salvadoran Finance Minister, stated that the use of Bitcoin will be fully optional in El Salvador in a televised interview yesterday. However, this caused confusion because it seems to contradict article seven of the Bitcoin Law that was approved last June, where it is explained that every economic agent will have to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. Alejandro Zelaya, the Salvadoran Finance Minister, stated that the use of Bitcoin in the country as a payment method will be fully optional and that there is no obligation for citizens to download the state offered wallet if they don’t desire to. The statements were offered in an interview given on a local television station. However, this seems to contradict one of the key articles in the Bitcoin Law. Article seven talks about the mandatory acceptance of bitcoin for payments. The article states:Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as a form of payment when it is offered by whoever acquires a good or service.However, when Zelaya was asked about this probable contradiction and the reason why they didn’t change the article, he only answered by asking another question. As such, the confusion remains only three weeks before the law is set to enter its application phase.The Central Bank of Reserves of El Salvador published a draft of a set of norms on Tuesday that will allow a better implementation of the Bitcoin Law. The draft details the duties of the economic agents that will use bitcoin in the Salvadoran economy. The presentation of the document also caused a stir in international cryptocurrency circles, because it states that entities must establish an organizational and functional structure to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing that includes applying KYC measures.The bank opened a consultation period for changes to be suggested to the document, which will extend until September 6, just one day before the law becomes active. Some dispositions of the law might change during the consultation period. All of this has caused mixed feelings in the Salvadoran population, and some to oppose the new law.According to a recent poll by Francisco Gavidia University, 77.5% of Salvadorans think that adopting bitcoin as legal tender in the country is a poor or wrong decision.What do you think about the future use of bitcoin in El Salvador?

So far, what I’ve seen is 99% … Let me be charitable, 95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.He also does not see any legitimate use case for bitcoin. “I’ve not seen any use case other than funding illicit activities like drugs and prostitution. I have not seen any use case that is legitimate so far that bitcoin solves. But if you want to launch Montana coin, don’t let me stop you,” the Fed official said.Some other government officials have voiced similar concerns. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this year that “Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern,” emphasizing that “many are used, at least in a transactions sense, mainly for illicit financing.”The president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank continued: “If you go in your basement, and you want to start producing your own currency, the secret service is going to come knock on your door and put you in handcuffs.” He added: “There is no barrier to you creating your own bitcoin or me creating my own — I’ll call it neelcoin.”Commenting on the sheer number of cryptocurrencies on the market, Kashkari opined:There are thousands of these garbage coins that have been created. Some of them are complete fraud, Ponzi schemes, where they pump it up, they dupe people to invest money and then the founders rip them off.In February, Kashkari similarly said that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were “like a giant garbage dumpster.”What do you think about the comments by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis?

574,Founder of the Bitcoin Mixer Helix Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charges,"Aug 18, 2021","Larry Dean Harmon, founder and operator of the bitcoin mixing service Helix has pleaded guilty on Wednesday to money laundering charges. Harmon’s guilty plea follows the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen) fining Harmon $60 million last year.According to several reports and a court-issued plea, Ohio resident Larry Harmon (38) pled guilty in a D.C. federal court on Wednesday for money laundering and conspiracy charges. Harmon detailed in court that he plans to cooperate with federal authorities after being accused of operating the bitcoin (BTC) mixing service called Helix from 2014 to 2017.U.S. prosecutors said that more than $300 million in bitcoin was transferred into Helix and sent out in an anonymous fashion. However, Charles Flood, the defense attorney for Harmon claims that the operator used a “double-blind system” so he was fully unaware of how much BTC was funneled through Helix.“One interesting thing about this case is there was a double-blind system Harmon had set up with Helix,” Flood said in the federal courtroom on Wednesday. “While he completely acknowledges that he violated the law and was in fact laundering money and knew it was drug proceeds … he does not know the exact amount laundered,” Flood added.In a U.S. Justice Department press release issued on February 13, 2020, Don Fort, chief of IRS Criminal Investigation explained that it was Harmon’s intent to obfuscate funds. “The sole purpose of Harmon’s operation was to conceal criminal transactions from law enforcement on the Darknet, and because of our growing expertise in this area, he could not make good on that promise,” Fort remarked at the time.The U.S. government is seeking the forfeiture of three specific properties Harmon owns in Ohio. The court-issued plea explains the federal government wants Harmon’s two properties in Akron, Ohio, and the property he owns in Aurora, Colorado as well.“It was the goal of the conspiracy for the defendant. Harmon, and other co-conspirators to unlawfully enrich themselves by operating a bitcoin money-laundering service which would conceal and promote illegal Darknet drug sales and other illegal activity,” the Justice Department’s paperwork notes.Harmon also pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges that are tethered to the former darknet marketplace giant Alphabay. On or about November 8, 2016, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent working undercover “transferred 0.16 bitcoin from an Alphabay bitcoin wallet to Helix.” The agent then exchanged the BTC in a manner so it was not “directly traceable to Alphabay,” the court statement notes.What do you think about the Helix founder and operator pleading guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges for his bitcoin mixing service?

577,Venezuelan Authorities Reconnect Affected Bitcoin Miners to Power Grid,"Aug 18, 2021","Venezuelan authorities have reconnected affected bitcoin miners to the power grid in Carabobo state, after having been disconnected for undisclosed causes. Sunacrip, the cryptocurrency watchdog in the country, mediated between the regional power utility authorities and the affected miners, and managed to exert pressure to reconnect these miners, who were disconnected last week.Venezuelan authorities executed a reconnection operation yesterday for a group of affected bitcoin miners. The miners were reconnected to the national power grid after they were cut off last week without an official explanation. Sunacrip, the national cryptocurrency watchdog, mediated between the affected miners and regional authorities in Carabobo state. This closes the bitcoin miner saga that started last week when all officially registered miners in Carabobo were disconnected by the national power company, Corpoelec.The reconnection occurred after miners got together with Asonacrip, a private nonprofit organization that works for the promotion of cryptocurrency in the country, and arranged a meeting with Sunacrip. At the meeting — that happened last week — Joselit Ramirez, head of the institution, promised miners they would be operating again in a 48-hour period.These miners were allegedly disconnected from the power grid due to a power contingency that the region was facing at that time, according to some people familiar with the matter. However, no official explanation has been offered by Corpoelec, the national power company.The meetings with Sunacrip and subsequent reconnection of power to miners only happened because all of the affected miners were registered and acted under the license of Sunacrip, as national laws mandate. However, there are many mining operations that are not licensed and are less resilient to this kind of event.Until now, several cryptocurrency mining machines have been seized by Venezuelan authorities across the country due to a lack of permits. Sunacrip has been promoting the benefits of mining registration in the country, but there is still opposition due to the distrust that some have in the crypto community toward the government. The occurrence of questionable actions against miners has diminished since Sunacrip established that security authorities could only visit cryptocurrency farms with the presence of one of its officers.What do you think about the reconnection of Venezuelan miners to the power grid?

578,Big Three Credit Agency Fitch Warns El Salvador Adopting Bitcoin Will Negatively Affect Insurers,"Aug 17, 2021","Fitch Ratings, the American credit agency and member of the ‘Big Three’ credit agencies, has published a paper on El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin and making the crypto asset legal tender in the country. Fitch believes that after the country enforces the new tender law it will face “volatility risk” alongside “regulatory and operating risks” as well. In 21 days, El Salvador’s bitcoin tender law will be enforced after the bill to make bitcoin legal tender in the country was approved by the Salvadoran Congress supermajority on June 9. Since then a number of opinions have surfaced about the country’s choice to adopt bitcoin stemming from organizations like Bank of America, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), members of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and individuals like European Central Bank (ECB) president, Christine Lagarde.Now one of the Big Three credit rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, has published a paper on why it thinks El Salvador adopting bitcoin may be risky. For one, Fitch doesn’t think bitcoin (BTC) will be widely used by the insurance sector and if they do leverage bitcoin, “insurers will likely convert bitcoin into USD as quickly as possible to limit exchange risks, if policyholders decide to use it to pay premiums,” Fitch’s report stresses.The bitcoin tender law set to be mandated on September 7, 2021, “appears to be unnecessarily rushed and leaves insurance companies with very little time to adapt to its requirements,” the credit agency’s editorial notes. The Fitch Ratings report adds:The ability of insurers to minimize their holding period will depend on whether the regulatory and operational framework allows for bitcoin to be immediately converted to USD, which is not clear at this time. Insurers that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets for extended periods will be acutely exposed to its price volatility, increasing asset risk, which is a credit negative.Fitch Ratings is not the only Big Three member that is not pleased with El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Moody’s downgraded El Salvador’s rating at the end of June and the bitcoin law is partly responsible. Moody’s lowered the country to a Caa1 from a B3 rating and highlighted a “deterioration in the quality of policymaking.”Fitch explains that it views earnings stemming from “speculative activities or risky exposures such as bitcoin as a credit negative.” The Fitch Ratings report further notes:Since [bitcoin] gains could quickly reverse, creating a volatile earnings stream. The country’s insurance sector is already exposed to low credit quality securities, mainly sovereign bonds (B-/Rating Outlook Negative) so additional holdings of high-risk assets will only compound this risk. As of YE20, sovereign and related investments represented 24% of capital and 21% of total investment portfolios of the insurance industry.Fitch concluded that it is expecting the adoption of bitcoin to force certain sectors of the economy like auditors, insurance agents, and more to “absorb new IT.” If bitcoin is adopted these types of economic sectors will have to leverage expenditure toward cryptocurrency infrastructure.“These likely will include a need to enhance internal protocols to accept payments, reinforcing the security of their systems from cyber risks and fraud and investing in advisory for the board of directors and managers, as well as training of personnel who will directly manage transactions,” the Fitch report concludes.What do you think about Fitch Ratings saying El Salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender will be a negative situation?

579,"Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano Are Most Popular Cryptocurrencies in Singapore, Survey Shows","Aug 16, 2021","A new study shows that ethereum is the most popular cryptocurrency among more than 4,000 adults surveyed in Singapore. The second-most popular crypto is bitcoin, followed by cardano.The new 2021 State of Crypto in Singapore, a joint study by Seedly, Gemini, and Coinmarketcap, was published Monday. It contains a survey of 4,348 Singapore-based adults ages 18 to 65 across varying household incomes.The survey was conducted between June 29 and July 9. It included 2,862 respondents who said they were current crypto holders and 1,486 respondents who said they were non-crypto holders. One in five crypto holders surveyed were women.According to the survey results, 78% of respondents who had crypto said they owned ethereum (ETH), 69% said bitcoin (BTC), 40% said cardano (ADA), 31% said binance coin (BNB), and 25% said XRP. The report describes:Of the 2,862 crypto holders, 2,236 of them are currently holding on to ETH. BTC is the second most popular cryptocurrency, with 1,975 of the crypto holders holding on to it. Coming in third and fourth are ADA and BNB , held by 1,141 and 893 investors respectively.The report notes: “With ETH, BTC and ADA being the most popular cryptocurrencies across both genders, females actually hold and trade XRP and DOT [polkadot] more than their male counterparts. USDT [tether], on the other hand, is more popular among male crypto holders.”Crypto investors also revealed how they were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The report notes, “Out of 2,862 people who invested in crypto, two-thirds of them invested more into crypto because of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The report adds, “The Covid-19 pandemic has spurred more Singaporeans to invest in crypto.”What do you think about this survey?

580,Reusable Payment Addresses: A New Tool to Provide More Privacy in Bitcoin Cash,"Aug 16, 2021","Electron Cash, a leading bitcoin cash wallet, has implemented a new feature called Reusable Payment Addresses. While still in its testing stages, this feature is a tool that can be leveraged to acquire a deeper level of privacy for your transactions, due to how it detaches public addresses from payment history, giving Bitcoin Cash some Monero-like capabilities.The developers of Electron Cash, one of the leading bitcoin cash wallets, have introduced Reusable Payment Addresses, a new privacy feature for the wallet. While it is still in its alpha stages, the functionality is there. Reusable Payment Addresses allows users to have another layer of privacy when transacting. When a user gives another a payment address, it also gives away the whole story of payments associated with it, alongside the balance it contains.This poses a big problem for privacy-concerned users: every time a user or company posts an address it means that entity’s financial information is exposed. Reusable Payment Addresses aim to solve this problem by providing an alternate address, called “Paycode.” Paycodes are different from conventional public addresses because they are not associated directly with the history of the user, and in this sense, they can be shared with no worries.Paycodes can also be associated with other usability features like Cash Accounts, which allows users to enjoy both the privacy of Paycodes and the convenience of human-readable account names.With this new addition, Bitcoin Cash is gearing up more and more for privacy options, offering some Monero-like capabilities to its users. Reusable Payment Addresses are just another tool that is now available for Bitcoin Cash users to further enhance their privacy arsenal. Combined with other tools like Cashfusion, which obfuscates transactions by fusing coins, it offers a comprehensive privacy-oriented suite for privacy-savvy users.While the Reusable Payment Addresses option is still in alpha stages and only available via the Electron Cash wallet, once it is sufficiently tested it could be implemented in any wallet, because it is open-source code software. The generalization of this functionality would create an opt-in privacy feature that could be useful for companies like restaurants and any others that don’t want to reveal their payments flow, and for political and freedom activists in several countries around the world. **Editors note: This article was inspired by the blog post published on the web portal bitcoinbch.com and the video below written and produced by the crypto entrepeneur Hayden Otto. What do you think about Reusable Payment Addresses and their function? Tell us in the comments section below.

581,An In Depth Look at Bitcoin's First Chain Split: Satoshi Helps Reverse the Creation of 184 Billion BTC,"Aug 15, 2021","Since January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network has been functional for 99.98662952015% of the time. However, the protocol has had a few hiccups along the way and on a few occasions, the chain split into two. Most people are well aware of the Bitcoin Cash split that took place on August 1, 2017, but the first time the Bitcoin chain split was 11 years ago on August 15, 2010.4,019 days ago on August 15, 2010, the Bitcoin community had a problem which was dubbed the “overflow bug.” What was also called a “malicious event” or “Strange block 74,638,” occurred between “11:34:43 CDT and 12:10:33 CDT on August 15th,” according to the bitcointalk.org user called “mizerydearia.” Many well known developers like Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen, and Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto participated in addressing the issue.Other participants involved with discussing the overflow bug incident included people like “NewLibertyStandard” and “Theymos” as well. The “output-value-overflow bug” was a critical problem because it produced 184.4 billion bitcoin (BTC). The event was not discovered until around 1.5 hours after it occurred, and the patch was finally delivered by Satoshi Nakamoto four hours later. The brunt of the entire ordeal lasted around five hours but the official codebase release by Satoshi was not finished until the next day.Before the client fix Bitcoin 0.3.10 was released by Nakamoto, a blockchain split had happened. 51 blocks were generated on the chain that split until eventually, the “good” chain reclaimed the proof-of-work (PoW) victory. Consensus for this event was driven by the developer’s concerns over the severity of the issue, the network’s miners, and the patch Satoshi Nakamoto had published.The community believes a malicious unknown entity created the overflow bug, which started at block height 74,638. At this time, two addresses received 92.2 billion BTC with a 0.5 BTC input that has never been spent. We know that approximately 51 blocks that were mined and validated by miners, were reverted back to the original state before the 184 billion BTC overflow bug. This means the Bitcoin chain experienced a blockchain reorganization or reorg after the community updated Bitcoin 0.3.10.Bitcoin has had other critical bugs and issues along the way during the network’s life cycle of 13 years and seven months. On April 1, 2012, Bitcoin participants got stuck on BTC block height 170,060 and after the fix, for a few months, 45% of Bitcoin miners would occasionally produce invalid blocks. Bitcoin’s second chain split, which saw around 24 blocks validated and then subsequently invalidated, was on March 11, 2013. This particular issue was a bit more controversial than the 2010 split, because developers coordinated to get a large mining pool (Btc Guild) to revert the chain to prior software after an accidental fork took place. There was also a successful double spend during the March 2013 rollback incident as well.BTC saw another chain split on the 4th of July in 2015 when the split saw six blocks go forward, up until the “good” PoW took over. The issue in 2015 stemmed from the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal BIP66 (soft fork) designed to make “changes to the Bitcoin transaction validity rules to restrict signatures to strict DER encoding.” Probably the most memorable chain split that occurred on the BTC chain was on August 1, 2017. On this day, the BTC community initiated a “Flag-day soft fork” in order to enforce BIP148 rules (Segwit). Additionally, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain forked away, as the mining pool Viabtc mined block the first BCH block (nr 478,559). Viabtc also left a message in the block’s coinbase parameter which said: “Welcome to the world, Shuya Yang!”As the years go by, the 2010, 2013, and 2015 chain splits have been mostly forgotten by crypto enthusiasts and many people were not involved at that time as well. There have been many arguments over the years concerning blockchain immutability. It is probably not the best term to leverage, even when discussing the strength of the Bitcoin network, as there have been a few blockchain reorganizations and hiccups along BTC’s path. Reorgs will likely continue to be a contentious subject, because it is like turning back time and erasing the ledger’s history, alongside the fact that executive hashpower is needed (March 11, 2013) at times to enforce the rules.While crypto enthusiasts have made fun of Ethereum over the DAO rollback incident, Vitalik Buterin was critical of the change that took place on March 11, 2013, as well. The Ethereum co-founder stressed that the reason why developers got away with the fix, was because of the mining pool Btc Guild’s large quantity of hashpower. “The reason why the controlled switch to the 0.7 fork was even possible was that over 70% of the Bitcoin network’s hash power was controlled by a small number of mining pools and ASIC miners, and so the miners could all be individually contacted and convinced to immediately downgrade,” Buterin wrote at the time.What do you think about Bitcoin first chain split?

582,'Wolf of All Streets' Trader Expects Bitcoin to Surpass $100K Within 6 to 12 Months,"Aug 14, 2021","Crypto trader and investor Scott Melker, also known as “The Wolf of All Streets,” expects the price of bitcoin to hit new all-time highs by the end of the year. “I would not be surprised at all to see bitcoin trading in six figures within the next six to 12 months, or ethereum even pushing towards $10,000 in that time,” he said. The trader also sees the Senate’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill as the biggest advertisement in history for bitcoin.Scott Melker, the host of “The Wolf Of All Streets” podcast, shared his bitcoin outlook with Kitco News last week. Melker is a trader and investor both privately and at Texas West Capital. He is the author of “The Wolf Den” newsletter and an advisor to a number of blockchain-based projects. In June last year, Binance awarded him the Influencer of the Year Award for North America.Commenting on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that the Senate passed last week, he said it was the greatest advertisement in history for bitcoin. With so many intense discussions within the crypto community and a growing number of lawmakers speaking in favor of cryptocurrency, Melker said:It’s raising awareness, which is probably actually causing more people to buy than to sell.He continued: “We’re talking about printing over a trillion dollars out of thin air to pay for an infrastructure bill that has absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency. But the one cryptocurrency provision froze the bill for three or four days. And we had the entire world talking about bitcoin and the crypto industry. There’s some irony there.”The host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast noted that the infrastructure bill still has to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law. “That wouldn’t even happen until 2023. So we’re talking about a very long time horizon for any activity here.”Another positive factor affecting the crypto market is the likelihood of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he opined. “The approval of an ETF would be the biggest single event in the history of bitcoin for that large wall of money to have the confidence to enter — pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds. They will come in when there’s an ETF.” The trader elaborated:That would be the catalyst for real institutional adoption of bitcoin. A regulated asset that they can trust and that is vetted by their risk managers and by the SEC.While noting that regulation in the crypto space is inevitable, Melker said the new SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, who previously taught crypto courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), will likely introduce sensible regulations that will benefit the crypto industry. Gensler recently told Senator Elizabeth Warren that additional authorities and resources are needed for the oversight of the crypto industry.“Reasonable regulation that protects consumers is a good thing and would likely open the door to a lot of big institutional money that’s waiting on the sidelines for that sort of green light to enter the space,” said Melker.Melker also discussed his price prediction for bitcoin and ether. At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin stands at $47,218 while the price of ether is $3,273 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.“It’s a function of the price actually catching up to the value,” The Wolf of All Streets host explained. “We saw a major liquidation of leveraged traders, which caused the cascade of prices to go down much further than they should have.”He elaborated: “When bitcoin dropped from $60,000 to $50,000, we saw almost $10 billion in liquidation. One million individual retail accounts were liquidated. And we saw similar activity from $40,000 to $30,000. I don’t think that that was the fair value of bitcoin. Now we’re seeing institutional interest coming back in and taking advantage of the dip prices.”Predicting new record-high prices for bitcoin and ethereum by the end of the year, Melker described:I believe that this correction is likely over and that we should see new all-time highs by the end of the year. I would not be surprised at all to see bitcoin trading in six figures within the next six to 12 months, or ethereum even pushing towards $10,000 in that time.He added that in the long run, bitcoin will likely be a seven-figure asset and ethereum a $20,000 to $30,000 asset at a minimum.In May, Melker said that investors could get into the crypto market by investing in the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, recently said that dogecoin is the “strongest” cryptocurrency when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.What do you think about Melker’s comments?

583,The Crypto Economy's Biggest 12-Month Gainers Outshined Bitcoin and Ethereum by a Long Shot,"Aug 14, 2021","2021 has been an incredible year for bitcoin, ethereum, and a great number of the world’s most popular digital assets. While bitcoin has gained around 300% during the last 12 months and ethereum has risen by 630%, a large swathe of crypto assets saw much larger gains. After the March 12, 2020 market crash that wreaked havoc on nearly every commodity in the world, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday,’ the crypto economy ballooned in value. Three months ago, most crypto assets tapped fresh new all-time highs, but quite a bit of these coins have since retreated between 30-55% in value. The lion’s share of crypto supporters dedicate their focus to crypto-assets like bitcoin, ethereum, or assets in the top 20 crypto assets by market valuation.However, even though BTC and ETH have seen 12-month gains between 300% and 630%, many other coins outshined these assets by a long shot over the last year. The biggest gainer during the last 12 months is a coin called game stars (GST) which is trading for $0.40 per unit. Game stars tokens have increased in value by a whopping 41,882% over the trailing 12-month period. Another crypto-asset that has done almost as well as GST, is mir coin (MIR), which is swapping for $3.73 per coin and gained a massive 41,462% in a year’s time.GST and MIR are followed by two more relatively unknown crypto assets which include content value network (CVNT) and stox (STOX) tokens. CVNT is up 20,101% in 12 months while STOX is up 13,957%. The next crypto asset on the list with massive 12-month gains is dogecoin (DOGE), which is one of the top ten most valuable crypto markets in terms of market capitalization. DOGE has increased in value by 7,730% over the last 12 months as each meme-based token trades for $0.283 today.As far as the top ten is concerned, binance coin (BNB) and cardano (ADA) have been the leaders after dogecoin’s 7,730% gains. BNB has risen 1,649% while ADA’s gains have been a touch lower at 1,450% during the year. 12-month statistics show that ethereum’s 630% would make ether the fourth largest gainer over 12 months out of the top ten positions today. Of course, it wouldn’t be right to forget about the past year’s biggest losers and the token hyperion (HYN) was the worst performer out of all 10,000+ crypto-assets.HYN lost 99.5% of its value and is followed by shipchain (SHIP) token which lost 99.21% over the year. Tendies (TEND) lost 94.34%, hycon (HYC) shaved 93.02%, and monero classic (XMC) lost around 92.32% over the course of the last 12 months. At the time of writing, the entire crypto-economy is worth $1.96 trillion and out of the top ten crypto market positions on Saturday, August 13, XRP is the biggest 24-hour gainer jumping 11% in value.What do you think about the largest gainers during the last 12 months?

584,Kidnappers Kill Venezuelan Citizen for Not Paying Ransom Requested in Bitcoin,"Aug 14, 2021","A Venezuelan merchant was kidnapped and killed after his family failed to gather a ransom that kidnappers explicitly asked to be paid in bitcoin. The perpetrators asked for a sum of 1.5 bitcoin to release the hostage, later lowering the ransom to 0.5 bitcoin. The family of the victim finally was unable to gather the ransom money.A Venezuelan citizen identified as Gustavo Torres González was murdered yesterday when his family failed to gather ransom money that kidnappers requested be paid in bitcoin. Torres was abducted on August 10 when he was presumably heading home in the Zulia state, according to police. The kidnappers quickly communicated with Torres’ family and asked to be paid 1.5 bitcoin to release him, according to local media. However, his family was not able to gather the funds, and in communications with the kidnappers, managed to lower the ransom to 0.5 bitcoin.Still, this was tragically a sum too hefty for his family to acquire, who only managed to gather 0.062 bitcoin ($2,750). Torres’ corpse was later discovered with six gunshot wounds on a local highway on August 11.While the kidnappers explicitly stated they would only take the ransom money in bitcoin, Torres had no apparent relation with cryptocurrencies. He was the owner of a local ISP internet company in the area, called Tutonet Investments. However, it is unclear if the Venezuelan citizen had any relationship with cryptocurrency mining operations, or if he accepted payments in cryptocurrency for his services.The popularity of cryptocurrency in the country has caused an increase in scams and crime using these new assets. Cryptocurrencies, due to their innovative design, can sometimes be more difficult to track than money moved via traditional fiat avenues. Still, statistics show that the overwhelming majority of crimes are still conducted by way of fiat money, and not cryptocurrencies.This is not the first time that a crime like this has happened. William Creighton, founder of an online gambling site called 5Dimes, was also kidnapped in Costa Rica in September 2018. Kidnappers asked for a ransom of $5 million dollars paid in bitcoin, but his family could only pay $1 million. His body was found in a nearby cemetery one year later, buried beneath a nameless tombstone.What are your thoughts on this tragic story? Should bitcoin be blamed for violent crimes such as this one? Tell us in the comments section below.

585,"Bitcoin Hurdles Over the $47K Zone, Crypto Economy Nears $2 Trillion","Aug 13, 2021","The price of bitcoin jumped over the $47K handle on Friday afternoon and at 4:15 p.m. (EDT) the price tapped $47,929 per unit. Bitcoin has jumped over 8% today and is more than 45% up over the course of the last month.The crypto economy grew to around $1.99 trillion on August 13, increasing more than 7.4% during the course of the day. The price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped over 8% and reached a new high for the month of August reaching $47,929 per unit. Seven-day statistics show BTC has climbed more than 11% and during the month more than 45% against the U.S. dollar. While a touch lower than the high this afternoon, BTC is still up 304% during the course of the year.Out of the $1.99 trillion, however, bitcoin only holds a 45% dominance among the 10,000+ digital assets in existence. Ethereum (ETH) commands 19.4% of the crypto economy dominance, while BNB and ADA hold more than 3% per market. During the last 24 hours, BTC has seen $31 billion in global trade volume and its market cap is around $894 billion on Friday evening (EDT).Tether (USDT) captures 54% of today’s BTC trades while the U.S. dollar commands around 15.1%. This is followed by BUSD (5.42%), JPY (4.79%), KRW (3.61%), EUR (3.43%), and USDC (2.02%). The creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin model, Plan B, retweeted an old tweet on Friday that he shared on June 20, which predicted similar price movements for June, July, and then the rise in August.It was the same tweet Bitcoin.com News reported on the following day which showcased Plan B’s worst-case scenario prediction of $135K for December.David Russell, VP of market intelligence at Tradestation Group has a less optimistic outlook than Plan B. “Bitcoin has surged more than 50% from its July 20 low, but now the rally may see a pause,” Russell told Bitcoin.com News on Friday. Russell added:The recent peak near $47,000 almost exactly matches the low from April 25. It’s also near the same level below which sellers got aggressive May 16-18. This is the most significant resistance area Bitcoin has yet faced in the current rebound.Meanwhile, as BTC has managed to hold above the $47K handle, the leading crypto asset faces heavy resistance ahead at the psychological $50K zone.What do you think about the recent bitcoin price jump on Friday?

586,Disconnected Venezuelan Bitcoin Miners Might Resume Operations in 48 Hours,"Aug 13, 2021","A group of Venezuelan Bitcoin miners that were disconnected from the power grid by regional authorities in the state of Carabobo might resume operations in the next 48 hours, according to the national cryptocurrency watchdog, Sunacrip. The institution met with affected miners on Wednesday and assured them it will make the necessary adjustments with regional authorities to allow them to operate and avoid further interruptions to the service.A group of miners disconnected from the national power grid in the Carabobo state in Venezuela met Wednesday with the national cryptocurrency watchdog, Sunacrip, to discuss the cause of this measure and find a possible solution to the problem. Asonacrip, the National Cryptocurrency Association, reported that Joselit Ramirez, the National Superintendent of Crypto Assets of Venezuela was present in the meeting and promised them a reconnection of the farms in the next 48 hour period.Asonacrip also stated the disconnected miners were operating in:…industrial parks suitable for the activity without damaging energy consumption, and additionally, with their income, they contribute to the recovery of the national electricity system.There was no mention of the real reason behind the power suspension of the miners in the meeting.Some people with knowledge of the matter stated that these miners were disconnected from the power grid due to a power contingency of the state. At the time of writing, there have been no official statements explaining the reason behind these actions.While there are no official numbers about miners in Venezuela, it is estimated that much of the hashrate operating in the country does so without a license from Sunacrip. That’s why the institution is always promoting miner registration and pushing the benefits of having a permit issued to mine cryptocurrencies. However, all of the miners that were affected by this measure were operating legally, according to Asonacrip.People weighed in on social media stating that the responsible state parties should reimburse miners for the losses caused by this kind of action, stressing this could make these occurrences less common in the future. Due to other occurrences, Sunacrip also stated that miners couldn’t be visited by police or military operatives without a Sunacrip official being present.What do you think about the meeting between Venezuelan miners and Sunacrip?

587,Didi Taihuttu Discusses Hiding His Cold Storage Wallets After Selling Everything for Bitcoin 3 Years Ago,"Aug 12, 2021","Over three years ago, a Netherlands native made headlines when he told the world he and his minimalist family sold everything for bitcoin. At that time, Didi Taihuttu and his family sold their home, valuables, and vehicles in order to accumulate the digital asset. Taihuttu recently discussed how things have been after three years, explaining that 74% of his crypto holdings are currently held in cold storage.Didi Taihuttu and his family are doing quite well in 2021 living like digital nomads and hidden hardware wallets all over the world, according to a recent interview with CNBC. Bitcoin.com News reported on the Taihuttu family on October 10, 2017, as Didi Taihuttu told the press he and his wife sold everything for bitcoin (BTC). In his latest interview, Taihuttu told CNBC that the family safeguards a total of six hardware wallets hidden across several nations.“I have hidden the hardware wallets across several countries so that I never have to fly very far if I need to access my cold wallet, in order to jump out of the market,” Taihuttu remarked during the interview. The bitcoin family man explained two positions are in Europe, two are located in Asia, a single wallet is kept in South America, and the last hardware wallet is stored in Australia. However, 26% of Taihuttu’s crypto stash is in hot wallets while the remaining 74% is stored using cold storage solutions. Taihuttu stressed:I prefer to live in a decentralized world where I have the responsibility to protect my capital.Taihuttu called his hot wallet stash “risk capital” and explained that he does some day trades from time to time. The digital nomad emphasized how he profited with the recent dogecoin (DOGE) volatility in 2021. While 74% of the Taihuttu stash is stretched across nations in cold storage, the family detailed they owned bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), and ethereum (ETH). The Taihuttu family, however, did not disclose to CNBC how much they held in their portfolio.Back in 2017, people called Taihuttu “crazy” but he remarked at the time that his family was “adventurous” and are going to gamble for a moment to live minimalist lives— If you never take a risk, life is boring.” During his interview this week, Taihuttu said that he’s trying to put cold storage solutions on every continent in the world. When it comes to post offices and financial institutions he finds these services “too risky.”“What happens when one of these companies goes bankrupt? Where are my bitcoins? Will I have access? You again put the trust of your capital in the hands of a centralized organization,” Taihuttu said during his interview. Taihuttu did explain that there are a few centralized cold storage solutions that handle funds well. Taihuttu added:They have beautiful setups for inheritance. When you die, these companies handle that, as well, and I really believe they are doing a great job.What do you think about Didi Taihuttu’s recent interview and his minimalist family?

588,Central Bank of Argentina President Hints at Possible Regulation of Bitcoin in Payment Systems,"Aug 12, 2021","Miguel Pesce, president of the Central Bank of Argentina, hinted at some kind of regulation coming for bitcoin transactions soon. Yesterday, In a digital financial conference, Pesce also stressed that the bank was working to find effective ways of warning novice investors about the dangers of putting their savings behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.Miguel Pesce, the current president of the Central Bank of Argentina, hinted at a possible regulation for bitcoin and bitcoin transactions in a digital financial conference organized by the Argentine Institute of Finance Executives (IAEF). Yesterday, Pesce stated on the issue it was very important to them to avoid linking bitcoin with the traditional exchange market. Pesce stated:We are going to regulate the intersection of Bitcoin with the payment system and the exchange market.To Pesce, Bitcoin is not a financial asset because it fails to be backed by any asset and cannot guarantee a stable yield. However, he ascertains that its scarcity allows the price to continue rising, giving the impression it is indeed a financial asset. About this, he stated:The Central Bank is not affected by the fact that these types of instruments can be used for transactions.However, the banker did imply that these instruments could be used to take advantage of unsophisticated investors in the form of scams. Because of this, Pesce considers there could be a very unfair effect if this money coming from cryptocurrencies mixes with the traditional exchange market. He stated that the Central bank of Argentina will try to avoid this. Pesce also stressed that such intermingling could be “very damaging for the instrument and also for the Central Bank regulations.”However, the Central Bank of Argentina is focused on achieving a wide digitalization of its payment systems, and they are betting on the intersection of traditional banking and fintech companies to get to that goal. To this end, it is promoting a new wire system called “Transferencias 3.0,” that will encourage the use of digital money in the country.Argentina is still a country big on cash. Over 90% of the transactions in the nation involve cash, so the bank has the challenge of modernizing this system to make payments easier. However, Pesce stated they were not planning to issue a digital currency for this task.What do you think about the statements of the president of the Central Bank of Argentina?

591,Vaneck Files for Bitcoin Futures ETF Following SEC Chair’s BTC Futures Regulation Statements,"Aug 11, 2021","Following a number of statements this week from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Gary Gensler, wealth management firm Vaneck has filed for a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).On August 10, the wealth manager Vaneck filed an application with the SEC in order to list the “Bitcoin Strategy ETF,” a fund that seeks “capital appreciation.” The fund will be an actively managed ETF that leverages bitcoin futures, pooled investment vehicles, and other ETFs that provide exposure to bitcoin (BTC).The latest Vaneck bitcoin ETF filing stresses: “The Fund does not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly.” The Bitcoin Strategy ETF will utilize bitcoin futures under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and it may also invest in “ETFs listed and traded in Canada, and exchange-traded products that provide exposure to bitcoin through the subsidiary.”Vaneck currently commands $63 billion in assets under management (AUM) and has been involved with bitcoin (BTC) for quite some time. At the end of June, Vaneck applied with the U.S. regulator to launch a bitcoin mutual fund, and the company is also hoping for approval for another bitcoin ETF that was filed back in December 2020.Vaneck is further shooting to provide an ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund as well. Last week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler outlined the regulator’s plans to regulate crypto assets and discussed crypto ETFs. Gensler’s statements seemed optimistic in regard to crypto ETFs when he said he looks “forward to the staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures.”Vaneck executive Gabor Gurbacs tweeted about the ETF filing on Tuesday and noted the company was the “first to file for a futures-based bitcoin ETF in 2017.” Members of the industry believe that CME’s bitcoin futures have been regulated for quite some time and because of Gensler’s latest statements, a bitcoin futures ETF may see the first approval.When Gensler said he looks forward to regulators reviewing ETFs that are particularly associated with bitcoin futures, he mentioned the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 as possibly being sufficient enough for regulation.Vaneck’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF explains that the fund is a “non-diversified fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ‘1940 Act’), and, therefore, may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer.” Gensler has also written a letter to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren in regard to her concerns over cryptocurrency regulation.What do you think about Vaneck’s latest crypto ETF filing?

592,Personal Finance Guru Advises Dollar-Cost Averaging Into Bitcoin,"Aug 11, 2021","Personal finance guru Suze Orman says she recommends dollar-cost averaging into bitcoin. She sees upsides to the cryptocurrency, noting that it could “turn into a payment structure.”Personal finance guru and best-selling author Suze Orman has shared her view of why she is bullish about the price of bitcoin.The Suze Orman Financial Group founder, whose show ran on CNBC from 2002 to 2015, has written 10 consecutive New York Times bestsellers about personal finance. She was named twice on Time Magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people and was appointed as a personal finance educator for the United States Army and Army Reserve in 2016. In addition, she won two Emmy Awards and eight Gracie Awards.In her recent Women & Money podcast, Orman advised her listeners how to invest in bitcoin and shared why she thought the cryptocurrency will perform well in the future.In terms of how to get into bitcoin and how much to invest, Orman advised:I think it’s something that you hold for the long term or you dollar-cost average into it with very, very little amounts.While the amount varies from person to person, she gave $100 a month as an example.As for where to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Orman mentioned the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. Previously, she recommended Paypal. However, the company currently does not allow users to transfer cryptocurrencies away from its platform, something the CEO said will soon change.Explaining why the price of bitcoin rallied recently, she cited Amazon’s job posting for a “Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead.” Orman pondered if the e-commerce giant is thinking about accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for payments. There were reports that the company will begin accepting BTC by the end of the year. However, Amazon denied the report, stating that there was no specific plan. Orman said, “When Amazon enters something you have got to pay attention to it.”Next, the financial expert pointed to Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, which began accepting bitcoin in March but suspended it due to environmental concerns. However, Musk recently said that Tesla will likely start accepting BTC again. Another reason, Orman noted was that there were $800 million in shorts on bitcoin and, like Gamestop, investors had to cover their shorts, which would send the price of BTC higher. She also said that all of a sudden wall street firms and venture capital firms are starting to invest again in companies dealing with bitcoin.Furthermore, she noted that cryptocurrency could become a payment mechanism, elaborating:It seems that the direction bitcoin is going is that, unlike gold that can’t be used to make a purchase, it seems like people are starting to gear up where crypto isn’t just going to be something like gold. It really would possibly turn into a payment structure.Orman added: “Now, if that were to happen where people are starting to take crypto as a payment then ethereum is a great place for you to look as well in terms of investing.”What do you think about Orman’s advice? Let us know in the comments section below.

593,Bitcoin Network's Mining Difficulty Expected to See Largest Increase in Over 2 Months,"Aug 10, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has been steadily climbing after dropping to 69 exahash per second (EH/s) on June 28, as it reached a high of 117 EH/s on Tuesday morning (EDT). The rise in hashpower will likely lead to the highest difficulty expansion in 89 days as estimates currently show a 7.39% increase is due in two days.In a touch more than two days’ time, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is expected to jump over 7.3% as the crypto asset’s overall hashrate has improved a great deal. Since June 28, Bitcoin’s hashrate has jumped 69.56% and has been rising higher following the lift in market prices.On July 15, Bitcoin’s hashrate hit a high of 130 EH/s holding just below that zone for the last 25 days, and once in a while, it has tried to surpass the metric. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty makes it more difficult for miners to find blocks and during the last epoch, it increased more than 6%. However, the largest increase since then was on May 13, 2021, when the difficulty increased by 21.53% that day.The next difficulty change shows an estimate of around 7.39% and could increase higher if the hashrate continues to climb. This means that over the last month, the difficulty will be close to 13.39% higher in two days. At the time of writing, BTC’s mining difficulty is around 14.50 trillion, and it is expected to be around 15.57 trillion after the next difficulty change.Besides the May 13 change, the difficulty adjustment will be the highest change since January 9, 2021. While the difficulty makes it harder to find BTC blocks, it can increase and decrease depending on how much hashrate is dedicated to the blockchain.On Monday, Antpool is the largest BTC miner, capturing 17.71% of the overall hashrate. Antpool has over 20 EH/s dedicated to the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain and is followed by Poolin’s 15.12 EH/s of hashpower. With more than 15 exahash Poolin has over 13% of the network hashpower today while Viabtc commands the third position.Viabtc’s 11.46% of the network hashrate derives from the 12.9 EH/s of hashpower it is applying to the chain. The fourth position is held by F2pool (10.83%), and the fifth-largest miner is Foundry USA (9.79%). Unknown hash or stealth miners still have a large quantity of global hashpower with 9.17% of the hashpower today or 10.9 EH/s.As of August 10, 2021, there are approximately 1,006 days until the next block reward halving and it’s likely miners will try to mine with as much hashpower as they can until then. When that happens, the 6.25 BTC block reward will shrink to 3.125 coins per block post halving.Give or take hashrate speed, there are roughly 144 blocks found every day and the BTC inflation rate per annum is only 1.76%. At the time of writing, the next difficulty retarget will be 386 BTC blocks away and at the current velocity of the network and market prices, it seems miners are in for a run of consecutive difficulty increases.What do you think about the upcoming difficulty increase and the fact that Bitcoin’s hashrate has been recouping from the losses at the end of June? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

594,AMC to Accept Bitcoin for Movie Tickets and Concessions by End of 2021,"Aug 10, 2021","AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., plans to accept bitcoin by the end of 2021 according to CEO Adam Aron on an earnings call on Monday. Aron said the movie theater chain will start accepting the leading crypto asset once the company has information technology (IT) systems in place. On Monday, during an AMC earnings call, the company’s board members and CEO discussed cryptocurrency acceptance. AMC is the largest movie theater chain in the world as the firm operates 7,967 screens in 620 theatres across the U.S. and 2,866 screens in 358 theatres in the EU. Adam Aron said during the conference call that he learned about cryptocurrency when he was on the Centricus Acquisition Corp board.​​“I’ve had to learn more in the past six months about blockchain and cryptocurrency than I learned about it in the entire decade before that,” Aron told the earnings call participants. The AMC CEO added:This increased knowledge has given me the confidence to tell you all today that AMC is hereby formally announcing on this call that by year’s end we will have the information technology systems in place to accept bitcoin.Following the announcement, AMC shares started to climb, gaining a significant 3.36% during the last 24 hours, and AMC is also up a whopping 1,494% during the last 12 months. The yearly gains AMC has seen have been attributed to the recent Wallstreetbets fiasco that took place a few months ago. While discussing the subject, Aron told the attendees that the system would have to work online so people can purchase movie tickets and concessions with bitcoin.AMC is also looking to improve its revenue sources because even though shares have done well, the company suffered from 18 months of lockdown procedures that shut down the entire AMC circuit. On March 26, after a number of California theaters started to reopen, AMC estimated that 99% of the U.S. theater circuit was open to the general public.What do you think about AMC accepting bitcoin for movie tickets and concessions?

Big figures in the Bitcoin Cash community as Roger Ver and Marcelo Fleischer, also know as Majamalu, an Argentinian Bitcoin Cash supporter, donated to the initiative.Now Bitcoin Cash Argentina is proposing to further expand its reach, using these new funds to onboard the next 150 merchants in the country during the next 180 days. Also, it has proposed to bring remittance operations to propose the use of Bitcoin Cash for this function.Bitcoin Cash Argentina also mentions the creation of a new adoption map, that will show Argentinians where to find businesses that accept bitcoin cash for their services. The proposal states:We are working on incorporating into our website a new search engine that simplifies directing clients to the merchants that accept bitcoin cash in Argentina. Our objective is that users may have a frictionless experience when searching and choosing a merchant that accepts bitcoin cash in Argentina.While there are already similar tools, most are not up to date with the latest business moves, and many users can feel frustrated when going to a store that supposedly accepts bitcoin cash only to find out it is not doing it. Bitcoin Cash Argentina’s approach is to minimize this possibility by running its own map tool, maintained by its team.The organization has already onboarded more than 100 merchants using the funds of its first Flisptarter campaign, even onboarding K24, a convenience store chain with more than 80 PoS in the country. The team also coordinated to meet K24’s suppliers, opening the door for B2B bitcoin cash-based operations among these companies.What do you think about the latest Bitcoin Cash Argentina’s Flipstarter campaign? tell us in the comment section below.

596,Venezuelan Authorities Shut Down Power Supply to Bitcoin Miners in Key State,"Aug 9, 2021","Regional authorities in one of the key states of the country, Carabobo, suspended the power supply of all registered miners, effectively shutting down their operations in the industrial state. While there have been no official explanations for this measure, some people with knowledge on the matter state the action was taken due to the enormous energy consumption these operations have in the zone.Regional authorities in Carabobo suspended the power supply of registered miners in the key industrial Venezuelan state yesterday, with no official explanation. People with knowledge of the matter allege that the mining userbase is consuming too much energy, threatening the power supply and the electric grid for the other subscribers.According to Criptonoticias, which has allegedly been in contact with people affected by these measures, the national power corporation and the Venezuelan cryptocurrency watchdog, Sunacrip, are planning to meet to assess the situation and try to find a solution for miners to keep operating amidst the power contingency the state is supposedly going through.Carabobo hosts an important part of the cryptocurrency and bitcoin mining companies that operate in the country, and this measure affects the sustainability of these operations.Cryptocurrency mining has been legal in Venezuela since Sunacrip passed a bill that regulated mining activities in the country. But all Venezuelans in the industry must obtain a license issued by Sunacrip. Miners must also detail their activities and keep a record of these for 10 years, according to the law. However, there are many miners that don’t trust the government and have decided to mine underground.This measure might be a pressure signal to all miners, to make them register with the national watchdog and to start mining in a legal fashion. Another potential reason for this suspension is that government officials could have foreseen an unstable power grid situation occurring at the same time the election of government party officials happened this weekend. However, sources explain that the measure would have been suspended after the electoral process, were that the case.Industry insiders have decided not to issue compromising comments on the measure until they can meet with the authorities responsible for taking these measures this week.What do you think about regional authorities shutting down miners in the Carabobo state of Venezuela?

597,Brazilian Court Sell $1.1 Million in Bitcoin Seized by Federal Police,"Aug 9, 2021","A Brazilian federal court ordered the sale of a bitcoin stash worth $1.1 million. The sale was conducted by the largest regulated exchange in the country, Mercado Bitcoin. The Federal Police seized the bitcoin sold from Tradergroup, a company that allegedly was operating as a Ponzi scheme, under the facade of being a cryptocurrency investment company. This is the first time a Brazilian court order initiated a bitcoin sale from seized assets in the country. A federal court in Espirito Santo ordered the sale of $1.1 million worth of bitcoins that were seized by Federal police back in 2019 from Tradergroup, an alleged Ponzi scheme that was operating under the cover of a cryptocurrency investment company. The company was intervened as part of the “Madoff” operation, where 43 Federal Police officers executed five searches and seizure warrants in Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Acre. The proceeds of this sale will be destined to pay for some of the obligations that Tradergroup still has with its former customers.Last month, the court decided the sale to be conducted in Mercado Bitcoin, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the country. The exchange sold nine lots of 3 bitcoin, and the last lot for the remaining value, at no less than 2% of the market price. Then, the fiat funds received for the sale were transferred to a court account.Federal Public Prosecutor Alexandre Senra. who ordered the sale of the bitcoins, stated:There are many victims of Tradergroup with lawsuits, mainly in the State Court, asking for the money invested back, and now a portion of this money will be able to be returned, not all because the credit sold in [bitcoin] was not enough to reimburse the losses.This is the first time that a federal court of Brazil orders the sale of a cryptocurrency asset via a commercial exchange. However, this does not mean that Brazilian authorities have lax regulations regarding cryptocurrency-related crimes. In fact, the country has been one of the most active in the cryptocurrency sphere in South America.Just last month, authorities arrested Claudio Oliveira, also known as the Brazilian “King of Bitcoin” due to his alleged involvement in a $300 million fraud scheme. The police also seized more than $33 million in a probe that linked unnamed cryptocurrency schemes to money laundering shell companies in the country.What do you think about the first bitcoin sale ordered by a federal court in Brazil? tell us in the comment section below.

I’m really into crypto. I think Bitcoin is the future.“It’s definitely going to be long term, but in ten years’ time, people who invested will be laughing,” he added.KSI proceeded to compare bitcoin to fiat money. “Just look at how money is inflationary compared to bitcoin, which isn’t. There’s a set amount – you can’t increase the amount of bitcoin and that has value,” he emphasized, elaborating:I feel like a lot of people are not really seeing that. They’re trying to look for quick money like, ‘Oh, I want to get in and out.’ This is a long-haul thing and I’m here for the journey.Last month, he shared the story of how he made millions of pounds investing in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, and “lost it all” when the crypto market “crashed.” Nonetheless, he still believes that “eventually you’re going to get a $100,000 bitcoin, a $500,000 bitcoin, and a $1 million bitcoin.

599,S2F Creator Plan B 'Reconfirms' His Confidence in Bitcoin Forecast — 'This Bull Is Not Over and $64K Was Not the Top',"Aug 8, 2021","Last month, the popular bitcoin analyst and creator of the stock-to-flow price model, Plan B, explained that he believed the “bull is not over.” On August, 6, Plan B is still showing confidence in his forecast and reconfirmed his message from last month. Meanwhile, bitcoin prices have been able to bounce back and on Sunday, bitcoin prices tapped a high of $45,355.Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a tear lately and oddly enough in the face of regulatory uncertainty in the United States. BTC has gained over 11% during the last seven days and 30-day stats show the leading crypto asset is up 31% against the U.S. dollar. Since the opening trading sessions on August 5, at $39,734 per BTC, the crypto asset has gained 12.97% in three days. Moreover, following the bullish action, the infamous pseudonym leveraged by the Twitter account @100trillionusd, also known as “Plan B,” seems more confident the bitcoin bull run is not over.Bitcoin.com News has reported on Plan B’s outlook on various occasions since he started documenting his popular stock-to-flow (S2F) price model back in March 2019. The incognito analyst has also updated the S2F price model to the stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) model.On June 1, Bitcoin.com News explained how Plan B thought the S2FX model was still intact and he claimed it was starting to look like 2013. A number of analysts have been comparing this run to the 2013 bull run because during that time BTC saw a double top.On August 1, Plan B explained that BTC’s realized capitalization was on the rise and in his opinion, things were looking bullish. “Bitcoin’s realized cap is rising again,” Plan B said. “Realized cap is the average price at which all 18.77M BTC were last transacted (calculated over all UTXO’s). Also, the few sellers at the moment sell at a profit (not a loss like in May and June). IMO this is bullish.”At press time the number of bitcoin (BTC) in circulation today is 18,779,913 BTC and the reward halving is expected in just over 1,008 days from now. At that time, BTC’s issuance will become far more scarce, as the block reward of 6.25 coins per block will be reduced to 3.125 coins per block post halving.Plan B’s S2F or S2FX is all about scarcity and essentially the crypto asset’s low issuance rate and scarcity should bolster the value of BTC over the long term. Basically the stock-to-flow measures the abundance or lack of when it comes to BTC’s long-term issuance rate. The current amount of BTC (stock) is simply divided by the number of bitcoins produced (flow) on an annual basis.In Plan B’s original thesis he also published a chart of other products like precious metals (gold & silver) to describe how the S2F model works with different commodities. Gold historically has shown the highest S2F ratio at least in terms of commodities like precious metals.Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a much higher S2F ratio which means over the long term, the crypto asset retains value or rises from significant demand. In 2019, when Plan B published his original model he added that “gold and silver, which are totally different markets, are in line with the bitcoin model values for SF.” The analyst also emphasized there’s an “indication of a power law relationship.” The pseudonymous analyst added:The model predicts a bitcoin market value of $1trn after next halving in May 2020, which translates in a bitcoin price of $55,000.After May 2020, the price of BTC did jump over the $55K per unit zone and the market valuation also spiked over a trillion dollars in overall value. Since then the price of BTC has dropped significantly on two occasions but Plan B is still confident.On August 6, Plan B re-tweeted an older tweet he published on July 2 and said: “Just to reconfirm this message from last month.” At that time, Plan B said that he believes the bull run is not over and today it seems he’s fairly certain his old statement from the first week of July still rings true. Plan B said:My onchain data (color overlay in the chart below) tells me this bull is not over and 64K was not the top. That is in line with [the] S2F(x) model. Also my floor indicator (not based on S2F) says we will not go below $47K Aug close.Plan B clarified that the floor estimator was not based on S2F when a person asked the analyst a question. “So Aug will see the price go above 47k? Is that what you mean?” the Twitter account dubbed “Crypto Storm” asked. “August will close above 47k. Ps, this floor estimator is not based on S2F,” Plan B replied.What do you think about Plan B’s current assessment? Are you a fan of the S2F or S2FX price models? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Out of the seven different bitcoin-pegged projects, the Wrapped Bitcoin protocol has 194,023 bitcoin-pegged ERC20 tokens in circulation.Ethereum (ETH) jumped over the $3K zone in value on Saturday, as the protocol successfully upgraded on August 5. ETH’s market valuation has gained a significant amount of dominance in terms of the $1.78 trillion crypto-economy capturing 20% of that value on Saturday.The crypto asset has also gained more than 700% against the U.S. dollar during the last 12 months. Much of this has been attributed to decentralized finance (defi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a myriad of decentralized exchange (dex) platforms over the last year.In addition, the Ethereum network houses the most bitcoin (BTC)-pegged tokens out of all the blockchain projects today. However, other blockchain projects are catching up fast as the BTC-pegged token (BTCB) issued on the Binance Smart Chain is around 73,111 BTCB (otherwise known as BEP2) in circulation today.Besides the Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) project, BTCB does have more BTC-pegged tokens than the latter six BTC-pegged Ethereum-based projects combined.

That’s more than 76.3% of the entire BTC-pegged token supply housed on Ethereum.Other BTC-pegged ERC20 token projects include HBTC (39,906), RENBTC (13,559), SBTC (3,039), PBTC (1,766), IMBTC (1,146), and TBTC (872). For comparison, HBTC is around 54% of the total amount of BTCB tokens issued on the BSC network.While tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum crosses $11 billion notional during the first week of August, dex platforms are allowing users to gather yields from their BTC via liquidity pools. A number of dex platforms allow users to provide liquidity and gain yield utilizing tokens like WBTC, SBTC, HBTC, BTCB, and RENBTC tokens. Some of the top dex applications allowing tokenized BTC utility like trading and liquidity pools include Uniswap, Sushiswap, Paraswap, and 0x API.Tokenized bitcoin on Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain is around 2,939.47 LBTC for the month of August. Data from the RSK sidechain shows approximately 2,020 RBTC at the time of writing.

603,"Analyst Predicts 'Refreshed Bull Market' for Bitcoin, Price Heading Toward $100K","Aug 5, 2021","Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone sees “a refreshed bull market” for bitcoin. Comparing the performance of the cryptocurrency to the start of 2019, he explained, “we see performance parallels that could get the benchmark crypto back on track toward $100,000.”Bloomberg Intelligence published analyst Mike McGlone’s August cryptocurrency outlook with a price prediction for bitcoin Wednesday.McGlone described that bitcoin is set to turn $40,000 into support, stating that “This year is prime for bitcoin to take the next step in its price-discovery stage and we see a refreshed bull market.” He further explained:Bitcoin appears to have built a base around $30,000 that’s akin to $4,000 at the start of 2019, and we see performance parallels that could get the benchmark crypto back on track toward $100,000.“The longest period below its 20-week moving average since 2018-19 indicates weak longs have been cleansed within an enduring bull market,” the analyst added. “What’s changed in about three years is sufficient to sustain more of the same for most of Bitcoin’s history — rising prices. Supply is declining while demand and adoption are rising in most countries that welcome open discourse and free-market capitalism.”He noted that the crypto crackdowns in China and the increased regulatory efforts by the U.S. government are part of bitcoin’s maturation. “The increasing dichotomy between China pushing back and the U.S adding clearer rules may mark part of a new and different kind of cold war. Countries restricting capital flows may fall behind in the digitalization process of money and finance,” he opined.Furthermore, the analyst said: “Bitcoin and gold are poised to follow the resumed upward trajectory of U.S. Treasury bond prices in 2H … Probabilities are rising that bearish 1H consensus will turn out to be temporary and provide an opportunity for more-enduring bull markets starting from a discount.”McGlone has long been bullish about bitcoin. The Bloomberg Intelligence analyst said in October last year, “The key thing about bitcoin is that I don’t see what’s going to stop it from doing what it has been doing for most of its life, and that’s appreciating.”Last month, he said that “Bitcoin is more likely to revert toward $60,000 resistance vs. $20,000 support if its history of recovering from similar too-cold conditions are any guide.”Meanwhile, a panel of crypto experts has predicted that by December 2025, the price of BTC will go up to $318,417. Furthermore, 54% of them think hyperbitcoinization — the moment that bitcoin overtakes global finance — will happen by 2050.Do you agree with Mike McGlone? Let us know in the comments section below.

606,FBI Joins Probe Into Collapsed South African Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,"Aug 5, 2021","In what is seen as a boost for Mirror Trading International (MTI) investors, United States investigators are said to have joined the probe into the collapsed bitcoin scheme. According to a report, the U.S. investigators’ goal for joining this probe is to help “recover the assets of out-of-pocket investors.”Confirmation of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation’s involvement in the MTI case comes just a few days after reports emerged that the scheme’s masterminds had filed an application seeking to stall the liquidation process. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the application also opposes attempts to declare MTI — which has been labeled the biggest bitcoin scam — an illegal business.Despite this attempt and other attempts to halt proceedings against MTI, the Bloomberg report suggests the U.S. law enforcement agency is already engaging MTI liquidators. The report explains:[Liquidators] had meetings with international law enforcement agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], after being approached by them. The FBI is joining forces with the liquidators of Mirror Trading International in the interest of several US and local investors.While a majority of MTI investors are believed to be based in South Africa, a significant number of the company’s 260,000 investors are also thought to be based outside the country. In fact, as past actions by American regulators already indicate, some of these investors are based in the U.S and this helps to explain the FBI’s interest in the case.In the meantime, the Bloomberg report also quotes MTI liquidators responding to claims by Cheri and Cylnton Marks that declaring MTI an illegal business will be detrimental to the interests of investors. The liquidators explained:It is not correct that having the business model of MTI declared a fraudulent and illegal scheme would allow the liquidators to seize all of the money that flowed into the scheme. Liquidators will only be entitled to recover payments made to investors which were not legally owed to them.According to liquidators, funds recovered will only be “spent reimbursing MTI’s true victims.”Do you think the involvement of the FBI will increase the chances of funds being recovered? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

607,"SEC Chair Gensler Outlines Plans for Crypto Trading, Exchanges, Investor Protection, Bitcoin ETFs","Aug 4, 2021","The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has outlined how the SEC plans to regulate the crypto industry. Focusing on investor protection, Gensler discussed concerns the SEC has about crypto trading, exchanges, lending, defi platforms, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).SEC Chairman Gary Gensler outlined the agency’s plans regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies at the Aspen Security Forum Tuesday. He described:Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West. This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications … If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.He elaborated: “There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.”The SEC chairman proceeded to explain that many tokens are offered and sold as securities. “I’ve urged staff to continue to protect investors in the case of unregistered sales of securities,” he said.Next, the chairman said he believes that crypto trading platforms, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (defi) platforms “can implicate the securities laws,” and in some cases the commodities laws and the banking laws as well.He also stressed that cryptocurrency trading platforms do not have the same investor protection as traditional exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In addition, he said that many overseas platforms allow U.S. investors to trade cryptocurrencies using virtual private networks (VPNs), thus bypassing regulations.Gensler emphasized:Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the Commission unless they meet an exemption … If a lending platform is offering securities, it also falls into SEC jurisdiction.The chairman also addressed investment vehicles that provide exposure to crypto assets, including mutual funds that invest in bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).“I anticipate that there will be filings with regard to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under the Investment Company Act (’40 Act). When combined with the other federal securities laws, the ’40 Act provides significant investor protections,” Gensler opined, adding:Given these important protections, I look forward to the staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures.Gensler also addressed the custody of crypto assets, stating: “Custody protections are key to preventing theft of investor assets, and we will be looking to maximize regulatory protections in this area.”Gensler stressed that the SEC has taken and will continue to take its “authorities as far as they go.”He also claimed, “The test to determine whether a crypto asset is a security is clear.” Nonetheless, he admitted that “There are some gaps” in regulating the crypto space, elaborating:We need additional Congressional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks. We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.The former MIT blockchain professor proceeded to emphasize that the SEC is ready to work closely with Congress, the administration, and other regulators worldwide to oversee the crypto space. He opined:In my view, the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending, and defi platforms. Regulators would benefit from additional plenary authority to write rules for and attach guardrails to crypto trading and lending.What do you think about Gensler’s comments on regulating the crypto industry?

608,Bitcoinsv Chain Suffers 51% Attack: Analyst Claims BSV Network Experienced a 100-Block Reorg,"Aug 4, 2021","Reports show that the Bitcoinsv blockchain suffered from a 51% attack on Tuesday, August 3, 2021, as the founder of Blockchair, Nikita Zhavoronkov explained the network endured a 100 block reorg “wiping out 570k transactions.” The Bitcoinsv (BSV) network has been having issues lately following problems the protocol saw in mid-July. At that time, 78% of the network was mined by a single entity called Taal and a number of exchange providers halted services. On August 3, the founder of Blockchair, Nikita Zhavoronkov, and numerous onchain observers discovered the BSV chain suffered from a deep blockchain reorganization, otherwise known as a reorg.Zhavoronkov tweeted about the issue on Tuesday and then clarified that the chain lost 100 blocks. “The reorg was 100 (!) blocks deep wiping out 570k transactions,” the Blockchair founder said. The onchain analysts at Coin Metrics caught the reorg as well alongside Lucas Nuzzi who also tweeted about the problems BSV had on Tuesday.“BSV is going through a massive 51% attack,” Nuzzi said. “After an attempted attack yesterday, some serious hashing power was unleashed today at 11:46AM and attackers are succeeding. Over a dozen blocks are being reorgd & up to 3 versions of the chain being mined simultaneously across pools.”A member of the Bitcoin Association (a BSV-related org.), Alex Speirs, published the BSV side of the story on August 4. The announcement is called a “Statement on August 2021 block re-organisation attack on the Bitcoin SV network.”“The Bitcoin SV network is currently enduring an ongoing series of block re-organisation attacks by a malicious actor attempting to illegally double-spend BSV coins,” Speirs wrote on Wednesday. “Bitcoin Association believes that this is the same attacker that previously initiated block re-organisation attacks against the BSV network on June 24 and July 1, 6 & 9, 2021.”According to Speirs, the Bitcoin Association (BSV) and the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team recommend that node operators “mark illegal chains initiated by the attacker as invalid.” Moreover, Speirs emphasized that the BSV association will collect evidence on such matters. Speirs said:[The] Bitcoin Association continues to collect evidence of the illegal activity and its representatives are actively working with law enforcement authorities in affected jurisdictions.At the time of writing, data from Coin Dance shows the miner Taal has 47.6% of the BSV hashrate and 27% belongs to unknown stealth miners. Taal is considered an honest and protective mining operator within the BSV community.The mining operator Taal has been able to capture 15 blocks in a row while this article was written. According to the blog post written by Speirs which also contains developing updates: “In the last 12 hours, two illegal chains created by the attacker have been successfully repelled.”At the end of November 2020, the Bitcoin ABC pro-IFP chain, which was nameless at the time, saw a great number of reorgs making the chain almost unusable. A mystery mining entity at the time that called itself “Voluntarism.dev” mined a great number of consecutive empty blocks and made it so no one could transact with the coin which is now called “ecash.”What do you think about the problems Bitcoinsv has been facing lately?

611,"Publicly Listed Bitcoin Miner Marathon Purchases 30,000 Mining Rigs from Bitmain","Aug 3, 2021","On Monday, the publicly listed bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings announced that it purchased 30,000 S19j Pro Antminers from Bitmain. According to the company, once the new lot of mining rigs are fully deployed, Marathon will gain 13.3 exahash per second (EH/s) from the newly added machines.On August 2, Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:MARA) revealed the bitcoin mining company has acquired 30,000 S19j Pro Antminers. Depending on the model, S19j Pro processes SHA256 hashrate at around 100 to 104 terahash per second. A single S19j Pro machine using today’s BTC prices, current mining difficulty, and electricity at $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), can profit by $29 per day. According to the announcement, the machines cost around $120.7 million for the entire lot.Marathon says that it anticipates all 30,000 newly purchased miners to be delivered between January 2022 and June 2022. This timeframe shows lead times for newly produced mining rigs from today’s top manufacturers can be quite lengthy. Marathon says after the rigs are fully deployed it will get an added 13.3 EH/s and “more than 133,000 bitcoin miners” under the company’s ownership.“If all of Marathon’s miners were deployed today,” the mining firm’s announcement details, “the company’s hashrate would represent approximately 12% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate, which was approximately 109 EH/s as of August 1, 2021.”Fred Thiel, Marathon’s CEO, emphasized during the announcement he thinks it is the perfect time to purchase mining rigs. “Increasing our percentage of the total network’s hash rate increases our probability of earning bitcoin, and given the uniquely favorable conditions in the current mining environment, we believe it is an opportune time to add new miners to our operations,” Thiel said. Marathon’s CEO added:“With this new order, we are growing our operations by 30% to approximately 133,000 miners, producing 13.3 EH/s. As a result, once all miners are fully deployed, our mining operations will be among the largest, not just in North America, but globally.”The number of bitcoin miners in North America has been growing. Firms like Marathon, Riot, Hut8, Galaxy Digital, Hive Blockchain, Ankr, Argo Blockchain, Atnorth, Bit5ive LLC, Bitfarms, Bitfury, Bitquest, Compute North, Core Scientific, and more have been purchasing a lot of mining rigs over the last year. Marathon settled a record-breaking mining rig acquisition in December 2020, when the firm purchased 70,000 bitcoin miners from Bitmain.What do you think about Marathon purchasing 30,000 bitcoin miners from Bitmain?

612,South Africa Bitcoin Heist: Court Grants Liquidators Authority to Track Missing Africrypt Investor Funds,"Aug 3, 2021","A South African court has granted liquidators of the collapsed bitcoin investment firm Africrypt the powers to track down missing investor funds. Also, as part of the court decision, Africrypt liquidators will now have the authority to sell assets and property belonging to the company. According to a report, the court decision follows recent claims that Raees Cajee, one of the collapsed firm’s directors, is opposing the final liquidation of Africrypt from his hideout in Tanzania. The latest decision by the South Africa court comes as doubts grow surrounding Africrypt directors’ claims of a breach by Ukrainian hackers.For instance, in the past few weeks the liquidators’ legal representative, Ruann Kruger, is reported to have released a statement wherein he unravels Africrypt’s dubious business model. In addition to questioning Africrypt’s model, the statement also takes aim at the evidence which has been used by the firm’s management to back the hacking claims.After examining Africrypt’s claims, Kruger’s statement goes on to repeat earlier allegations that Raees and his brother, Ameer, may have had a hand in the disappearance of investor funds. The statement says:There is no evidence that this was indeed a hack of the Africrypt systems, and in support thereof, it seems that funds were depleted from the Africrypt wallets four months before the alleged hack.Soon after Africrypt abruptly stopped operating back in April 2021, a group of investors immediately applied for the court to grant a liquidation order against the investment company. According to the report, a provisional order was duly granted on April 26, while parties to the final liquidation proceedings are now expected to argue their cases in September.Meanwhile, the report also quotes liquidators explaining the importance of the court’s decision to grant them additional powers. The liquidators said:With the liquidator’s extended powers, they will be able to investigate and interrogate the relevant parties, directors, and their related companies during the enquiry to uncover the mystery behind this ostensible bitcoin heist. The liquidator’s main objective is to track down assets, attempt to gain access to Africrypt systems and their source codes to recover bitcoin wallets and funds invested and lost by investors.To aid in this process of recovery, the liquidators confirmed that a forensic auditor has been hired to look into the affairs of Africrypt and related parties.Do you agree that these additional powers are going to be useful to the liquidators’ cause? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

613,Bank of America Sees Benefits in Adopting Bitcoin as Legal Tender in El Salvador,"Aug 2, 2021","Bank of America has outlined some benefits to be had from adopting bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. The opportunities include low-cost remittances, financial digitization, more choices, and greater investments from foreign companies.Bank of America (BOA) outlined some potential benefits in El Salvador adopting bitcoin as legal tender in a report published last week.The analysts, including Latin American strategist Claudio Irigoyen, explained that “The market has been excessively pessimistic about it and is overlooking any argument in favor, even if those benefits are admittedly more uncertain.”Firstly, the report details:Bitcoin could be used as an intermediary for cross-border transfer … Using bitcoin for remittances could potentially reduce transaction costs compared to traditional remittance channels.The Bank of America analysts further noted that bitcoin’s volatility could be reduced if the conversions between BTC and dollars “happen automatically.”Financial intermediaries would receive less in remittance fees, leaving recipients with more disposable income. However, Bank of America cautioned, “it is unclear how the bitcoin transaction fees would compare to traditional remittance channels.”Secondly, the Bank of America report describes that “financial digitization” could be another benefit since “more than 70% of the adult population in El Salvador does not have a bank account.” The analysts emphasized, “democratizing access to electronic payments through bitcoin has a progressive touch.”In addition, adopting bitcoin as legal tender is “giving more choice to consumers,” the Bank of America analysts noted, elaborating:We disagree with the notion that it is coercive that businesses will be legally bound to accept bitcoin as form of payment as long as they have the proper technological infrastructure.They further explained that payments can automatically be converted to dollars using the government’s electronic wallet, Chivo.Lastly, the report said that bitcoin adoption could bring foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into El Salvador, such as from Strike, bitcoin miners, and ATM manufacturers. At least two crypto ATM companies have already announced plans to install cryptocurrency ATMs in El Salvador: Chainbytes and Athena Bitcoin.Despite seeing some benefits, Bank of America believes that adopting bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador is negative overall, largely due to the cryptocurrency’s high volatility.

615,"While Chinese Bitcoin Miners Escaped Crackdowns, Sichuan's Hydropower Plants Were Not So Lucky","Aug 2, 2021","Regional reports from China indicate that government officials have been reviewing over 5,100 small-sized hydropower plants in order to get them to adapt to China’s cleanup and rectification process concerning future energy sources. China has pledged to be carbon neutral and ultimately have zero carbon emissions by 2060 and the recent crackdowns on bitcoin miners and small power plants have been fueled by this goal. During the last few months, China’s goal to get net carbon emissions down to zero in 39 years has affected bitcoin miners and small power plants in five different provinces. China’s president, Xi Jinping, surprised the world when he said China was committed to reducing emissions down to zero.Bitcoin miners and small power facilities started to feel the effects of China’s goal to drastically reduce emissions when reports surfaced from Inner Mongolia. Following the issues in Inner Mongolia, bitcoin miners in Xinjiang were instructed to shut down on June 9, 2021.Xinjiang reports were followed by bitcoin mining bans in Qinghai province, and then Yunnan province saw warnings from officials as well. Finally, after a May 31 report that notified the public officials from Sichuan would discuss bitcoin mining in the area, Sichuan authorities sent notice to bitcoin miners in the province to shut down by June 25.These crackdowns made it so Bitcoin’s global hashpower shuddered from 147 exahash per second (EH/s) on June 14, to a low of 69 EH/s on June 28. In addition to bitcoin miners, small-sized hydropower facilities were forced to follow a cleanup and rectification process. The rectification orders stem from the Sichuan Provincial Water Resources Department and government officials from the Yangtze River Economic Zone.Bitcoin.com News reported on the mandates seemingly pushing a few hydropower stations to put the hydropower facilities up for sale. The regional publication People’s Daily reported last week that the crackdown has hurt hydropower operators who could not complete the government’s cleanup and rectification mandates.People’s Daily reporters say 5,131 small hydropower plants were reviewed in total but a great number were caught in regulatory crosshairs. 3,528 were able to successfully complete the mandated processes but 1,360 hydropower facilities were unable to complete the cleanup and rectification orders.Furthermore, 243 hydropower plants are in limbo as they are considered “reserved” by Sichuan and Yangtze River Economic Zone officials. The People’s Daily report notes that it is uncertain whether or not these hydropower plants will continue after government officials from China make their decisions.Bitcoin miners have had warnings for a long time and many started migrating elsewhere last year. At the moment, one of the of most popular destinations is Kazakhstan and there has been a myriad of reports indicating a lot of Chinese operations are moving to Kazakhstan.Unfortunately, hydropower facilities are not so versatile and cannot shut down shop and move with such ease and China’s crackdown has desecrated many small-sized hydropower operators.What do you think about the officials from the Yangtze River Economic Zone and Sichuan cracking down on hydropower facilities in China? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

616,"While GBTC Bitcoin Stacking Slows, Grayscale Accumulates Alternative Crypto Assets","Aug 2, 2021","Established in 2013, the firm Grayscale Investments has managed to become the world’s largest asset manager for digital currency. While initially starting with bitcoin, the company has since added a myriad of different crypto assets as Grayscale commands $36.34 billion in assets under management (AUM) between 13 different digital currencies. While the asset manager has a large sum of bitcoin, ethereum, and ethereum classic, lately Grayscale has been stacking a great number of other coins.Since the asset manager started seven years ago, Grayscale Investments has accumulated a lot of cryptocurrencies. As it stands today, the company is the largest asset manager globally when it comes to cryptocurrency management.The company first introduced the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC) and ever since then, it has added 12 unique cryptocurrencies to the firm’s investment products. Data provided by 1000x.group’s institutional dashboard shows that Grayscale hasn’t really been stacking bitcoin (BTC) this year.The chart that shows the approximated amount of bitcoin (BTC) held by Grayscale has remained flat in 2021. In fact, 1000x.group’s institutional investment quarterly inflows (non-cumulative) statistics that separate bitcoin inflows from alternative digital assets indicate Grayscale has been accumulating a great number of other crypto assets.Statistics from bybt.com further show the same thing, as BTC, ETH, and ETC purchases have not been seen in the last 30 days. Seven-day stats show an increase in litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), and zcash (ZEC). Weekly stats also show an increase stemming from coins like stellar (XLM), chainlink (LINK), and filecoin (FIL). Monthly data shows an increase in every crypto asset Grayscale offers except for BTC, ETH, ETC, and XLM.Grayscale’s largest holding in terms of fiat value is bitcoin (BTC) as they hold 650.27K BTC worth $27.15 billion at the time of writing. In terms of the most tokens held, it would be 72 million stellar (XLM) but the XLM stash is only valued at $20.73 million. Grayscale holds 3.15 million ethereum (ETH) worth $8 billion and ether is the second-largest holding in terms of fiat value.Grayscale also holds 12.3 million ethereum classic (ETC) worth $636.76 million and 1.58 million litecoin (LTC) worth $229.64 million. At the time of writing, Grayscale holds 319.4K bitcoin cash (BCH) worth around $175.52 million on Sunday. The company also has two diversified funds which is a basket of different digital currencies. Grayscale recently introduced its decentralized finance (defi) fund and today it has $6.3 million AUM. The firm’s large capitalization fund has $403.2 million AUM between BTC, ADA, BCH, LTC, LINK, and ETH.What do you think about Grayscale stacking a lot of alternative digital currencies instead of bitcoin?

617,Buda Exchange Starts Requesting Selfie Verification for Withdrawals to New Bitcoin Addresses,"Aug 2, 2021","Buda, a Chile-based cryptocurrency exchange, has started requesting selfie verification every time a user needs to withdraw funds to a new bitcoin address. This new measure now introduces a new layer of security for users to avoid getting their accounts hacked, but it will only be mandatory for those that don’t have 2FA activated. Buda, a Chile-based exchange formerly known as Surbtc, will now implement new security measures to protect its users from hacking attempts. The platform will now require the user to send a selfie verification every time a withdrawal to a new bitcoin address is requested. However, this will only affect users that have not activated their two-factor authentication (2FA) measures.The measure was announced in a mail delivered to the customers of the exchange on June 22, when it asked users to enable their 2FA option in order to be excluded from having to comply with this new measure every time a withdrawal is directed to a new crypto address. According to the email, the decision to do this was motivated by a series of phishing email scam campaigns targeting the company. The email explained:These last weeks we have detected several pages that are posing as Buda.com. It is similar to that fake SMS that comes to you to obtain credit from the bank. This is called phishing.Until now, there have been no reports of losses linked to these phishing attacks.While the exchange has had run-ins with banks in the past in Colombia and Chile, where these institutions denied servicing it and even ran a banking embargo against it in June 2018, today the story is different. The exchange is now part of the Colombian sandbox that enables and pairs cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to test their joint operations.As part of this new framework, Buda has now partnered with Bogota’s Bank, offering its customers the possibility of making direct deposits and withdrawals to and from the exchange respectively. While these operations were already supported by Colombian banks, this new alliance recognizes these ones as official transactions to exchanges, liberating the users from any block or other measures that the banking operator could take. This has happened with Binance and several banks in the U.K.What do you think about Buda’s new selfie verification for deposits to new Bitcoin addresses? Tell us in the comment section below.

618,Bitcoin Difficulty Increases 6% — It's Still 48% Easier to Find BTC Blocks Than It Was 30 Days Ago,"Aug 1, 2021","As expected, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increased this week jumping 6.03% higher on July 31. The change marks the first increase out of five difficulty adjustment changes. This was after four downward difficulty drops made it 54% easier to mine bitcoin than it was prior to mid-May.On July 31, at block height 693,504, the Bitcoin blockchain’s difficulty adjusts itself depending on how much hashpower is dedicated to the network. The more hashrate dedicated to the BTC chain, the higher the difficulty will rise every two weeks. On the other hand, if a great number of miners go offline and dedicated hashrate drops, the difficulty will drop making it easier for mining participants to find BTC blocks.Bitcoin’s system and how it works is mathematically predictable, which is a stark difference from the shadow finance system the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have participated in for decades. Because Bitcoin is transparent, we know that every 2016 blocks, the difficulty will change to keep the block generation time around 10 minutes. This means we know that as of 1:00 p.m. (EDT), there’s 1,782 blocks left or 11 days until the next difficulty change.While the last four difficulty changes made it 54% easier to mine than before May 13, the difficulty increased for the first time in eight weeks by a touch over 6%. This is because miners who went offline during the crackdown in China, have seemingly returned to some extent.At the time of writing the hashrate is over 100 exahash per second (EH/s) at around 114 EH/s on Sunday. That’s a lot better than it was 33 days ago when 90-day recorded stats showed the hashrate down to 69 EH/s on June 28. That drop in hashrate led to the massive 27.94% decline in difficulty at block height 689,472.At the time of writing, the mining operation Antpool is the largest bitcoin mining entity, in terms of overall dedicated hashrate. 15.48% of BTC’s SHA256 hashrate stems from Antpool which is around 17.13 EH/s of hashpower. Antpool is followed by Viabtc (14.87 %), Binance Pool (11.00 %), Poolin (10.18 %), and the pool operated by Btc.com (9.98 %). These five pools combined capture 61.51% of BTC’s global hashrate today.Furthermore, stealth miners or 9.98 % of the global hashrate is owned by “unknown miners” with around 11.04 EH/s of hashpower. As of the mid-afternoon hours on Sunday, the current hashrate leads calculations to assume that the next difficulty change will be an increase again.Despite the increase on Saturday, BTC blocks are still 48% easier to find today than they were before May 13, 2021. Estimates show on Sunday that the difficulty is expected to rise again in 11 days and increase around 1%. However, depending on hashrate speed, the estimate could change higher or lower as the countdown gets closer.Today, the difficulty is around 14.5 trillion and is expected to increase to 14.65 at the next difficulty change.What do you think about the recent increase in mining difficulty? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

619,Analysts Discuss Bitcoin Over-the-Counter Desks Bubbling With BTC Demand,"Aug 1, 2021","Digital currency markets have been gathering gains again moving past the lows seen a few weeks ago. This week crypto traders have been discussing over-the-counter (OTC) desks bubbling with demand for bitcoin as the co-founder of 21st Paradigm explained, “high net worth individuals [and] institutions want your bitcoin.”Most traders either use decentralized exchange (dex) platforms or centralized exchange (cex) operations to acquire bitcoin (BTC) and a myriad of other digital currencies. However, high-net-worth individuals and institutions usually don’t leverage dex or cex applications, as they choose to trade via over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks. OTC trading or off-exchange trading is trading between two parties directly and usually with help from the OTC desk’s representative. In contrast to trades that take place on cex or dex platforms, these trades are not recorded on order books. Although, transfers from crypto OTC desks can be recorded.Two days ago, the co-founder of the advisory firm 21st Paradigm, Dylan LeClair, tweeted about some large OTC transfers last week by sharing a chart from Glassnode analytics. “Big transfer volumes from OTC Desks over the last week,” LeClair said at the time. “High net worth individuals [and] institutions want your bitcoin,” he added. Another individual agreed with LeClair and said “Yessssirr,” because the individual, Will Clemente, shared a tweet on July 22 that had shown a similar trend.“OTC Outflow RSI showing the strongest BTC buy signal since July of last year,” the analyst Will Clemente said to his 158,000 Twitter followers. “This indicates buying from institutions/high-net-worth individuals,” he added. A number of other traders discussing the subject on Twitter agreed with the OTC demand assessment and the social media platform is littered with threads discussing the subject. One individual tweeted:Don’t give the smart money your BTC (or ETH)…A number of other ‘whale-like’ and large purchasing patterns were noticed by bitcoiners observing different metrics. While bitcoin has been rising, traders also suspect that China might be buying bitcoin. There have been a few noticeable market changes during the early morning hours in China, according to Trustnode’s research.Meanwhile, during the last 24 hours bitcoin (BTC) has consolidated just above the $41K handle and has only moved +0.10% on Sunday, August 1. However, BTC is still up 17% against the U.S. dollar during the last week and 30-day stats show BTC has gained over 22%. Bitcoin had managed to jump above the $42K handle at $42,615 per unit, but has not been able to hold above the $42K zone for long periods of time.What do you think about the bitcoin OTC demand assessment from traders and analysts on social media? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

620,Bitcoin Cash Shows Maturity in Its Fourth Anniversary,"Aug 1, 2021","Born four years ago as a result of the disagreement between two groups over scaling issues, Bitcoin Cash has grown to be so much more. Offering a full suite of solutions for cryptocurrency users, having support from thousands of merchants at a worldwide level, and recently introducing Smartbch, a project that aims to tether smart contracts functions to the protocol, Bitcoin Cash is now more mature than ever. However, mishaps have also happened along the way.On August 1, 2017, in the midst of a big scaling debate that shook the cryptocurrency world to its core, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was the result of a series of disagreements among developers and Bitcoin influencers about how to achieve blockchain scaling in the best way possible. Some supporters opted to scale onchain by increasing the block size, and that idea transformed into what Bitcoin Cash is today.However, since that time, and thanks to the contributions of several people and organizations, but not without difficulties and forks along the way, Bitcoin Cash has become now a robust blockchain with an established upgrade path that seeks to minimize the drama that’s associated with upgrades and forks in the past. This has been especially important because most of the upgrades that have affected the chain have derived from the planning, standards, and the inclusion of improvements into the protocol every six months.Even with a few bumps along the way, and being a minority chain, Bitcoin Cash has managed to move forward with its principal goal, which is providing more economic freedom to those who need it in the world. From technical achievements like Schnorr Signatures, the implementation of a token standard called SLP, and a new difficulty algorithm, to focus on the social part of the cryptocurrency spectrum by supporting communities in countries like Venezuela, South Sudan, and Argentina, Bitcoin Cash covers the whole spectrum of action of what a cryptocurrency represents.Bitcoin Cash is considered the most successful Bitcoin fork in the whole cryptocurrency market: it is present in most of the leading exchanges at a worldwide level, Including, Binance, Huobi, Upbit, Coinbase, Okex, and even Paypal. And is accepted by millions of cryptocurrency users at a worldwide level.This has been another interesting year for the Bitcoin Cash community, which sadly, experienced yet another blockchain split last November 15 that gave birth to another chain, denominated Bitcoin Cash ABC. The event had its origin in the discussion around the infrastructure development fund that Bitcoin ABC, the leading node implementation at the time, wanted to adopt, and a new DAA (Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm).However, most of the community rejected the plan that proposed miners concede a part of their block rewards to a central authority of developers to help subsidize development expenses and chose to stay with the original chain’s ruleset. This split resulted in the separation of Bitcoin ABC, led by Amaury Sechet, who was one of the original collaborators of the currency, from the Bitcoin Cash project.The debate over funding projects also gave birth to one of the fundamental projects for Bitcoin Cash this year: Flipstarter. Flipstarter, which is a noncustodial crowdfunding tool that uses BCH, showed that the BCH community could thrive using its own means to fund valuable projects for the environment. More than 12 projects have collected over $1 million for last August, and that amount has only grown exponentially since that time.On the institutional side of things, BCH also had some interesting victories. Grayscale was greenlighted to offer shares of its Bitcoin Cash Trust to institutions last August, meaning that now institutional investors could get exposure to the asset without having to worry about custody, a big concern for many investors interested. Privacy also experienced a big jump, with Cashfusion, a fungibility protocol directed at obscuring cryptocurrency transactions in the Bitcoin Cash chain, reaching a milestone of $3.2 billion anonymized.Bitcoin Cash is also making a big leap to decentralized finance. Last year, General Protocols, a company dedicated to building decentralized finance (defi) protocols on top of BCH, raised $3 million from strategic investors after launching Anyhedge and Detoken, the first two defi instances of tools designed to operate on top of the BCH protocol. And just recently, a new sidechain called Smartbch that uses Bitcoin Cash as its main token was launched, with the ability to run EVM compatible content. This would give Bitcoin Cash, in theory, an equivalent functionality to Ethereum and compatibility.As all of this happened, the development of the currency didn’t stop. A number of node implementations joined a new node called Bitcoin Cash Node and the devs collectively took over the development tasks of the protocol. On May 15, 2021, a new update was applied to the BCH chain with success. This update brought a number of important improvements, including the inclusion of an unlimited number of unconfirmed chained transactions. Also, new measures to add transparency and standards to control what gets upgraded and when, like CHIPs (Cash Improvement Proposals), are designed to avoid new confrontations like the ones that happened in the past.Bitcoin Cash has one of the few chains that has presented adoption as one of its first priorities since its beginning. The whole objective of scaling was to allow more people to transact using Bitcoin Cash with low fees. And this last trait has made it especially interesting for third-world countries where users can’t pay high fees to use crypto as currency.Throughout this last year, there have been important efforts to bring bitcoin cash to the hands of the underserved. Bitcoin Cash Argentina, a new Bitcoin Cash nonprofit, has onboarded more than 100 merchants in the area and has hosted meetups to promote the knowledge and use of cryptocurrencies in the region. The organization operated with its own funds until last May when it successfully crowdfunded a Flipstarter campaign that allowed it to expand its objectives.Other groups are also doing the same in Venezuela and Colombia: Led by George Donnelly, former Dash supporter, Bitcoin Cash Latam has been onboarding merchants and users, showing the benefits of using cryptocurrencies in inflationary and devaluation-based economies. The organization has been targeting the Venezuelan capital heavily, and now hundreds of merchants already know how to use cryptocurrency for their benefit.Satoshi’s Angels is another group that has been consistently running merchant adoption campaigns since December 2020, arming a strong ambassador team that has successfully onboarded 300+ merchants so far. According to one of its founders, Akane Yokoo, the team has been organizing three monthly virtual meetups for two regions in English and one in Spanish, which are both open for everyone to join globally.While this year’s celebration will be affected by the Covid-19 related measures that are still affecting mobility and operations in some countries, Satoshi’s Angels will host a live stream to commemorate this milestone. Users could get free BCH airdrop every day before the event if they follow the hosts and retweet the airdrop posts with CCTip. There will also be an airdrop during the event for the present users in the chat. There will be also other regional live streams and discussions throughout the day.What do you think about the fourth year of Bitcoin Cash’s existence? Tell us in the comments section below.

621,Multi-Billion Dollar Hedge Fund Goldentree Is Reportedly Adding Bitcoin to Its Balance Sheet,"Aug 1, 2021","The hedge fund Goldentree, a firm with $41 billion in assets under management (AUM) has reportedly added the leading crypto asset bitcoin to its balance sheet. Unnamed sources detail that the American asset management firm leveraged bitcoin to diversify from traditional debt investment strategies. The wealth management firm allegedly has been looking for staff that understands blockchain technology and it’s possible Goldentree is circling distressed businesses within the crypto industry.A recent report stemming from the financial publication The Street, says the mega-hedge fund Goldentree has purchased bitcoin (BTC). The author of the report, Michael Bodly did not reveal the unknown source who explained that Goldentree invested in bitcoin. A source disclosed that executives at Goldentree are looking into employing staff that understands crypto solutions and blockchain tech.Despite looking for help, the undisclosed source told the reporter that the fund was fluent with things like “trading crypto and making VC-style investments in blockchain companies.” It’s also been said that three Goldentree executives have invested in the venture capital group Borderless Capital. The report does not disclose how much Goldentree purchased, but it was said the hedge fund was looking for investment vehicles that are different from debt-based instruments.“The New York-based firm has been adding bitcoin to its balance sheet as a diversifier for the broad mix of debt-focused strategies it has run for years, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter,” The Street journalist Bodly writes. “The sources were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive business dealings,” the author’s report adds.The unidentified source means, as far as the alleged BTC on the company’s balance sheet is concerned, Goldentree won’t be included on the Bitcoin Treasuries list. As of July 31, 2021, 59 public and private firms hold bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets. Goldentree was founded 21 years ago by Steven Tananbaum, a well known American hedge fund manager. Bloomberg referred to Tananbaum as “one of Wall Street’s biggest investors in distressed debt” in 2018. Bitcoin (BTC) as an investment vehicle is quite the opposite of traditional debt-based strategies Goldentree typically leverages.Goldentree’s investment strategy has allowed it to capture $41 billion AUM from things like distressed and leveraged loans, and emerging debt markets. There’s also a possibility that Tananbaum and Goldentree are circling the crypto and blockchain industry for distressed startups. In 2015, CNBC nicknamed Tananbaum a “vulture investor” that was circling indebted tech companies. Since The Street reported on Goldentree’s alleged bitcoin purchase, the hedge fund has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.What do you think about the report that says Goldentree is stacking bitcoin in its treasury?

625,US Senator Lummis: Big Government Spenders Are Accelerating Adoption of Crypto Assets Like Bitcoin,"Jul 29, 2021","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis is pushing for regulation that would ensure bitcoin remains a good store of value. If the cryptocurrency “is to become what El Salvador has done, legal tender, then we need to make sure that we are using it in ways that comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws,” she said. The pro-bitcoin senator also noted that big government spenders are “doing far more to accelerate the adoption of digital assets” than she is.U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has shared her view about cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Following the Senate Banking Committee’s hearing about cryptocurrencies, she tweeted Wednesday:Big gov’t spenders are (accidentally) doing far more to accelerate the adoption of digital assets than I am. The debasement of our currency is causing a flight to digital assets like bitcoin that are a store of value.However, she added that “spending America deeper into a hole is a stupid, inflationary and altogether undesirable way to drive people to digital assets.” The senator emphasized: “I want USD to continue as the world’s reserve currency. We need to reign in spending and support financial innovation on U.S. soil to protect the status of the United States.”In an interview with Fox Business Wednesday, Senator Lummis was asked what form of cryptocurrency regulation she would like to see in the U.S. going forward.“I want to start with good solid definitions … I want the end result to be a regulatory sandbox where everyone understands the rules but innovation can still occur unrestricted,” she replied.She was then specifically asked how the crypto regulation she is pushing for would affect bitcoin. She explained:We want to make sure that bitcoin can continue to serve as a good store of value. And, if it is to become what El Salvador has done, legal tender, then we need to make sure that we are using it in ways that comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws. We want to make sure that it’s used legitimately.The senator from Wyoming was also asked if she owned bitcoin herself. “I do own bitcoin myself. It’s the only cryptocurrency I own. I own it because it’s a great store value. I’m going to save it so when I retire I know it’s there,” she described. “The only digital asset that I understand is bitcoin because it’s such a great store of value. Only 21 million will ever be mined.”Lummis further opined:I encourage other people, who want to make sure that they have a diversified asset allocation for their retirement, at least one asset that they know is going to hold its value much like gold, that they consider bitcoin.What do you think about Senator Lummis’ comments on bitcoin and regulation?

626,Bitcoin Mining Operation Reveals Plans to Convert Coal Ash Landfill Into Solar Farm,"Jul 29, 2021","Following the announcement from Greenidge Generation Holdings that detailed the company would be promoting a carbon-neutral stance, and the firm’s recent partnership with Foundry, Greenidge revealed on Thursday it is investing profits into a renewable energy investment program. The company is in the midst of expediting the closure of a coal ash landfill in order to construct a new solar farm. In 2014, the Lockwood Hills landfill in Dresden, New York was purchased by Lockwood Hills LLC, which is a subsidiary of Greenidge. The site has been “safely maintained” over the last seven years, Greenidge claims, and it ended the use of coal-fired power at the adjacent power facility during that time. The announcement on Thursday says the company plans to safely cap and close down the landfill and Greenidge hopes to install “a solar project across the 143-acre site that will produce up to 5MW of power.”The bitcoin mining company says that the move is aligned with the firm’s efforts to improve the environment in New York. While it is working on projects like the Lockwood Hills landfill, Greenidge details it is purchasing voluntary carbon offsets from U.S. greenhouse gas reduction projects. Jeff Kirt, CEO of Greenidge, believes bitcoin mining models can advance operations in a way that keeps the environment safe.“Bitcoin mining at Greenidge is already a model for the industry in that we are advancing this emerging financial platform for people across the world in a manner that fully protects our environment and drives economic growth across Upstate New York,” Kirt said in a statement. The move makes renewable energy a reality by leveraging bitcoin mining profits to fund the creation of a new solar farm at a landfill site, Kirt added.Greenidge is just one of many crypto mining projects attempting to rejuvenate the environment by transforming business models and removing waste through the process. For instance, Stronghold Digital Mining converts waste coal into alternative energy in order to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the end of May, EZ Blockchain partnered with a Texas-based oil provider to monetize wasted natural gas with bitcoin.Before Greenidge’s acquisition in 2014, the Lockwood Landfill was permitted to hold coal combustion residuals (CCR) and other wastes. Greenidge details that it will ensure “the site will no longer accept waste of any kind,” add a water filtration system, and a permanent engineered membrane to stop erosion.“For those of us who grew up and still live right here in the Finger Lakes, the Lockwood Hills landfill has been a constant presence, overlooking Seneca Lake and the Village of Dresden, and something we always hoped would eventually not be needed,” Greenidge president Dale Irwin said in a statement.Irwin added that he was pleased that bitcoin mining facilities can not only create jobs and support local businesses, but crypto mining operations can also “facilitate the development of renewable energy at this old landfill site.”What do you think about Greenidge converting the Lockwood Hills landfill in New York?

627,"Bit Mining to Deploy Another 2,500 Bitcoin Miners in Kazakhstan","Jul 29, 2021","Bit Mining is going to expand its operations in Central Asia with the purchase of 2,500 crypto mining machines slated for deployment in Kazakhstan. The new devices are expected to increase the Chinese company’s total hashrate capacity by an estimated 165 petahashes per second.Shenzhen-based Bit Mining Ltd. announced Wednesday it has secured a purchase agreement for the acquisition of 2,500 new bitcoin mining machines. The price tag of the deal is approximately $6.6 million, the crypto mining firm detailed in a press release.Following the delivery, which is scheduled for next week, the company intends to ship the coin minting rigs to Kazakhstan. Once deployed, the mining devices are expected to increase Bit Mining’s “theoretical maximum total hash rate capacity by approximately 165 petahashes per second (PH/s).”Bit Mining said it’s constantly monitoring the market for cryptocurrency mining hardware and will consider “cost-efficient” acquisitions “on an opportunistic basis.” It emphasized:Looking forward, the company is prepared to further expand the scale of its business and increase its theoretical maximum total hash rate capacity, in order to strengthen its position as a leading cryptocurrency mining enterprise.The crypto firm further noted that the expansion of its bitcoin mining machine fleet goes on in parallel with the implementation of its overseas development strategy which is largely focused on Central Asia. Bit Mining has already installed 3,819 rigs with a total hashrate capacity of 172 PH/s in data centers in Kazakhstan. Another 4,033 bitcoin miners with a hashrate capacity of 121 PH/s have been shipped to the country and are currently awaiting deployment.According to the announcement published by Prnewswire, the company has also launched ethereum (ETH) mining operations outside of mainland China that have a hashrate capacity of 86.4 gigahashes per second (GH/s). “An additional hash rate capacity of 4,713.6 GH/s is expected to be deployed by the end of October 2021,” Bit Mining added.In May, the Chinese company revealed plans to build and operate a 100 MW crypto-mining data center in Kazakhstan, a project that will be implemented in partnership with two local companies. In June, Bit Mining began moving 3,000 bitcoin mining machines to Kazakhstan amid an ongoing government crackdown on crypto mining in the People’s Republic of China.Do you expect more crypto mining companies from China to follow Bit Mining’s lead and relocate to Central Asia?

On that day, the high of the BTC price was $35,189.75 and the low was 34,155.90 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.His estimate suggests that Tesla is holding 42,069 BTC. Musk subsequently replied: “We don’t have that many bitcoin, but it’s close.”Tesla bought bitcoin worth $1.5 billion in the first quarter. The company also began accepting the cryptocurrency as a means of payment in March but stopped in May citing environmental concerns. However, Musk said at a recent bitcoin event, “The B Word,” that Tesla will likely resume accepting bitcoin.At the end of the second quarter, the company reported its bitcoin holdings worth $1.311 billion after impairments.

Lolli says the new financing will help the firm expand, hire and develop new partnerships. The New York-based Lolli has raised $10 million from investors, according to the company’s announcement on July 28. The company said that the Series A was led by Acrew Capital, Banana Capital, Up North Management, and Animal Capital.The venture capital company Animal was founded by social media moguls Noah Beck, Josh Richards, and Griffin Johnson. Lolli further detailed that investors like Baron Davis, Kenny Beecham, Logan Paul, and Chantel Jeffries participated as well.The CTO and co-founder of Lolli, Matt Senter, said that Acrew Capital’s investment shows the company understands that bitcoin-based businesses are blossoming.“Acrew’s sizable bet on Lolli says two things: bitcoin business is booming, and as the original bitcoin rewards platform, Lolli has the best team to increase adoption in the long run,” Senter said in a statement. The Series A funding will be used to expand the firm, recruit new employees, and “further development of the recently launched mobile app.”Tiktok star and social media giant Josh Richards and the Youtuber and entrepreneur, Logan Paul, also discussed the Lolli investment. “I’m thrilled to be investing and helping to fuel the growth of a company that allows users to earn and learn about this new asset class,” Youtube star Logan Paul said on Wednesday. Josh Richards said that his firm Animal Capital believes in companies that are embracing the modern age. Richards remarked during the announcement:At Animal Capital, we believe in companies that are meeting modern users where they are – by bringing opportunities to invest in bitcoin to shoppers of all ages, Lolli is poised to transform the way that people, especially young shoppers, think about investing.Lolli isn’t the only service that offers crypto rewards these days for shopping, and the app competes with pre-paid crypto cards like Blockfi’s and Crypto.com’s Visa cards. The company was recently reviewed on July 13 by bitcompare.net’s Dean Fankhauser and achieved a score of 4.5 out of 5. Fankhauser’s review is fairly comprehensive but mentions some drawbacks tied to Lolli’s application.“You’ll need to wait between 30 and 90 days before seeing any actual earnings from the app,” Fankhauser writes. “Considering how small these earnings are, that’s a long time to wait for an online shopping reward.”The review also says that “returning items on which you’ve already earned bitcoin rewards can also muddy the waters of the system.” In contrast, Crypto.com’s wait time for crypto rewards on pre-paid crypto debit purchases is negligible because the crypto rewards are instant.What do you think about Lolli raising $10 million from investors in a Series A funding round?

630,"Mike Novogratz Says Institutions Are Buying Bitcoin, Politicians Need More Crypto Education","Jul 28, 2021","Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz says that cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have bounced back because institutional investors are buying. Responding to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto stance, he stated, “We need to do a much better job going to D.C.” to educate lawmakers.Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz talked about the outlook for bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.He was asked how he sees bitcoin’s price action and what he thinks has been driving the price of the cryptocurrency back to the $40,000 level. The pro-bitcoin executive replied:Crypto has bounced back because institutions are buying.He brought up the FTX exchange as an example. The exchange recently raised $900 million from more than 60 investors, putting the company’s valuation at $18 billion. Investors included Softbank Group Corp., venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, private equity giant Thoma Bravo, Daniel Loeb’s Third Point, the Paul Tudor Jones family, and British hedge fund manager Alan Howard.Novogratz dismissed the explanation that the price hike was due to the news that Amazon may be accepting cryptocurrency payments.Emphasizing that institutions are some of the smartest investors in the world and they are participating in the crypto space, he said:That sent a signal to the whole crypto market that this isn’t going away.“This was partly a big short-covering rally and partly recognition that this is a real market that isn’t going anywhere,” said the Galaxy Digital CEO.Novogratz was also asked about cryptocurrency regulation and what it could potentially look like in the U.S. particularly after the warnings by Senator Elizabeth Warren.Warren warned Tuesday that bitcoin’s price fluctuations put retail investors and businesses that accept bitcoin payments at risk. In addition, she claimed that individuals who use bitcoin as money are criminals.Regarding Senator Warren’s remarks about cryptocurrencies, the Galaxy Digital CEO opined:It was disappointing. She was supercilious. She was smug. Really disappointed she hadn’t done any work. This is a progressive technology. She is supposed to be a progressive.“Crypto goes after the rent takers. If you look at defi [decentralized finance]. If you look at the NFT [non-fungible token] revolution. It’s going to empower artists and creators over the people that used to make money off their backs. So, really frustrating and disappointing,” he continued, adding:It just tells us … We need to do a much better job going to D.C. and educate [lawmakers].Novogratz also responded to Warren’s anti-cryptocurrency stance on Twitter Tuesday.“Banks charged $12 billion in overdraft fees, a fortune in ATM fees, a fortune in checking account fees. But you keep going after crypto where saving and money transfer is a fraction of banks. Good job Senator Warren. You really don’t seem so progressive to me,” he tweeted, elaborating:If banks had the transparency of defi protocols, we would not have had the mortgage crisis. Defi will win because it’s better.“Atomic settlement. Bearer assets. Composability. Transparency. We just need to solve for KYC which is coming. We need to educate our politicians,” he concluded.What do you think about Novogratz’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.

631,IMF Warns Against Adopting Crypto Assets Like Bitcoin as Legal Tender,"Jul 27, 2021","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned against adopting cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, as legal tender. Noting numerous risks and costs involved, the IMF does not see crypto assets catching on as a national currency.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a blog post on Monday discussing the topic of cryptocurrencies as legal tender. The post titled “Cryptoassets as National Currency? A Step Too Far” was authored by Tobias Adrian, the financial counselor and director of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, and Rhoda Weeks-Brown, general counsel and director of the IMF’s Legal Department.The post does not mention El Salvador, the Central American country which recently adopted bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The authors wrote:As national currency, cryptoassets — including bitcoin — come with substantial risks to macro-financial stability, financial integrity, consumer protection, and the environment.While acknowledging the advantages of crypto’s underlying technologies, the IMF directors insisted that governments “need to step up to provide these services … Attempting to make cryptoassets a national currency is an inadvisable shortcut.”Nonetheless, the directors do not believe that crypto assets will catch on as people in countries with stable economies will have “very little incentive to price or save” in crypto assets while less stable economies would prefer adopting “globally recognized reserve currency such as the dollar or euro.”A crypto asset might, however, “catch on as a vehicle for unbanked people to make payments, but not to store value,” they opined, emphasizing that “It would be immediately exchanged into real currency upon receipt.” The two IMF directors noted:Then again, real currency may not always be readily available, nor easily transferable. Moreover, in some countries, laws forbid or restrict payments in other forms of money. These could tip the balance towards widespread use of cryptoassets.The authors proceeded to warn about the “cost of widespread adoption of a crypto asset such as bitcoin.” Not only “households and businesses would spend significant time and resources choosing which money to hold as opposed to engaging in productive activities,” but government revenues would also “be exposed to exchange rate risk,” the wrote, adding:Also, monetary policy would lose bite. Central banks cannot set interest rates on a foreign currency.They warned that domestic prices could become highly unstable and financial integrity could also suffer.In addition, they said: “cryptoassets can be used to launder ill-gotten money, fund terrorism, and evade taxes. This could pose risks to a country’s financial system, fiscal balance, and relationships with foreign countries and correspondent banks.”There are also legal issues in adopting cryptocurrencies as legal tender. “Legal tender status requires that a means of payment be widely accessible. However, internet access and technology needed to transfer cryptoassets remains scarce in many countries, raising issues about fairness and financial inclusion,” they pointed out. Furthermore, “Changes to a country’s legal tender status and monetary unit typically require complex and widespread changes to monetary law to avoid creating a disjointed legal system.”Banks and other financial institutions could also be exposed to the massive fluctuations in cryptoasset prices, the IMF directors noted, adding that mining cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, requires “an enormous amount of electricity to power the computer networks.” Emphasizing that “The ecological implications of adopting these cryptoassets as a national currency could be dire,” they added:Moreover, widespread cryptoasset use would undermine consumer protection. Households and businesses could lose wealth through large swings in value, fraud, or cyber-attacks.What do you think about the comments by the IMF directors?

632,"Stacks AMM Revealed, Native Bitcoin Swaps Executed With Proof-of-Transfer Protocol","Jul 27, 2021","According to a recent report, the first trust-less swap between the Bitcoin blockchain and Stacks protocol has been executed. The co-founder of the Stacks protocol, Muneeb Ali tweeted about the native bitcoin swap and said the progress is a big deal. On July 23, a trust-less swap using the Stacks protocol and the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain was settled onchain. The swap dubbed the “Catamaran Swap between BTC and STX” was discussed on the Reddit forum r/stacks.“The first trustless swap between [the] Bitcoin [blockchain] and Stacks chain is happening,” a user wrote on the forum. “It is similar to a submarine swap. However, I would call it catamaran swap because we have two chains on top of the water,” the individual added. Further into the Reddit thread, the individual notes that the swap was “successfully completed.”People can see the swap conditions as defined on the Stacks chain and then the bitcoin transfer and the verification. According to the description, the asset swapped was a non-fungible token (NFT) asset called “Boombox (b-12).” The creator of the Reddit post wrote that the “swap demonstrates that you can trigger trustless actions like asset transfers by sending bitcoins from one address to another.”The individual added that the feature gives Bitcoin a “new dimension” because “transfers can be inspected and validated by smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.”The Stacks project is considered a Layer-1 blockchain that leverages the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain as the base layer. Validation is provided by proof-of-transfer between both networks and similar to Ethereum’s Solidity programming language, Stacks has a programming language called Clarity. The co-founder of Stacks, Muneeb Ali, tweeted about the milestone on Monday, as he wholeheartedly believes it’s a watershed moment.“Users can do trustless BTC swaps to stablecoins, derivatives, perpetuals, and other crypto assets,” Ali stressed in his Tweet. “All by pure bitcoin transactions on the main BTC chain. Users can purchase any digital assets (like NFTs and decentralized domains).” Ali further remarked that it was a big deal and stated: “Bitcoin has established itself as digital gold, but you can’t use BTC to trade without going through: (a) centralized exchanges or (b) alt blockchains w/ wrapped [bitcoin]. Not anymore.”The computer scientist and Stacks co-founder said that wrapped bitcoin is “not bitcoin” and said that many bitcoiners don’t trust the network models that house these crypto assets. As far as centralized exchange (cex) platforms, Ali mentions that there’s counterparty risk involved and users need to pass KYC requirements. “All that changes now,” Ali said.“Stacks is a unique L1 blockchain that enables cross-chain transactions with Bitcoin: smart contracts that work with pure bitcoin transactions. Using Stacks, developers have built trustless swaps with native BTC,” the Stacks executive detailed.Ali also said that usd coin (USDC) will soon be supported and that “trust-less BTC/USDC swaps can be possible.” He added that Ethereum features are possible directly on Bitcoin, and users can create “Uniswap-like AMMs (Automated Market Makers) built around native BTC swaps, [and] do pure BTC transactions to interact.” Moreover, Ali highlighted that these features will come with the robust security of the BTC blockchain. The Stacks executive’s tweetstorm continued:Bitcoin is sovereign money. An entire open financial world will be created around Bitcoin. Native BTC swaps to new assets are a foundational building block of Bitcoin defi. Bitcoin eating the banks.Of course, a few people mentioned to Ali that the project Thorchain has been doing trust-less swaps for quite some time now. In fact, the popular peer-to-peer trading platform Shapeshift leverages Thorchain’s tech to complete native swaps. Although, someone was quick to point out that Thorchain has been having some issues with hacks in recent times.The next day, the Stacks executive mentioned the Automated Market Maker (AMM) project being built on the protocol called ALEX. The ALEX project describes how the protocol works in a blog post published on Tuesday.According to the website and the recent blog post, the AMM allows users to lend, earn and borrow bitcoin with minimized risk and maximized returns. In a tweet, the ALEX Twitter account says that the AMM “helps crypto users preserve their capital and maximize the value of their assets – we do this by offering fixed-rate lending/borrowing and superior LTV with higher security and lower fees.”The Stacks team still has some stiff competition with projects like Thorchain, Badger DAO, and RSK. Many of which already have fully operational defi applications that allow people to chase liquidity pools and other types of defi protocols. Alongside this, despite Ali’s claim that people don’t trust the network models with concepts like wrapped bitcoins, the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has an enormous lead over projects like Stacks, Badger, RSK, Liquid, and Thorchain combined.During the last two years, ETH and BSC have seen a plethora of projects that allow cross-chain swaps, synthetic and wrapped bitcoins, stablecoins, AMMs, lending pools, and decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. Just on the Ethereum chain alone, there’s WBTC, HBTC, RENBTC, SBTC, PBTC, TBTC, and IMBTC which adds up to a whopping 250,729 bitcoin housed on the ETH network.What do you think about the swap between Stacks and the Bitcoin blockchain and the AMM ALEX?

633,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Parameter Set to Increase for the First Time in 8 Weeks,"Jul 27, 2021","Bitcoin’s hashrate has slowly crept back up between 85 exahash per second (EH/s) to 125 EH/s on July 14. The increase in hashpower has made it so the next mining difficulty change will increase for the first time in eight weeks. The four consecutive difficulty drops turned out to be the largest slide in Bitcoin’s lifetime, and that’s seemingly coming to an end in four days.The price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped for a few consecutive weeks, and during the same time frame, China’s crackdown on bitcoin miners was also happening. On May 15, bitcoin’s price began sliding from just above the $50K handle to end up just above the $30K zone on May 19.A price drop essentially removes revenue from bitcoin miners and when BTC started sliding on May 15, the mining difficulty had jumped two days earlier, up 21.53% higher than the adjustment before. Because it was over 21% more difficult for miners to find a block, the next two weeks were grueling.On top of this, what followed was the Chinese government — in various provinces — cracking down on bitcoin miners and banning the act within specific areas. Miners taken by surprise were told they needed to shut down facilities by a certain date.Prior to June 9, and two small dips to 137 EH/s, the hashrate managed to remain above 150 EH/s with the difficulty 21% higher. However, China’s actions had impacted Chinese bitcoin miners a great deal and on June 28, the hashrate was only 66 EH/s.Luckily, bitcoin miners got the first downward difficulty adjustment on May 29 when it slid 15.97%. As the price of BTC got worse, making it harder for miners to profit, the entities that help secure the blockchain benefitted from three more downward difficulty drops.All four consecutive mining difficulty drops made it 54% easier to find BTC blocks over the last two weeks, in comparison to the difficulty height prior to May 13. The consecutive downward adjustments will likely change in four days with a possible increase of around 3-5%.If the estimate comes to fruition it will still be close to 50% easier to find BTC blocks than it was before mid-May 2021. However, it will depend on what happens within the next four days as far as hashrate is concerned.If the hashrate increases a great deal from now until then, the difficulty could climb higher than 5%. If the global hashpower was to decrease dramatically, the estimated increase could get nullified and revert back to another decrease. At the current hashrate, a 3-5% increase is expected which shouldn’t be too grueling for miners to manage.At the time of writing, the top bitcoin mining pool is Antpool with 19.26% of the hashrate and 19 EH/s. Antpool is followed by Binance pool (12.47%), F2pool (11.82%), Poolin (11.38%), and Viabtc (10.50%).What do you think about the expected difficulty adjustment increase in four days?

634,Africrypt Bitcoin Heist: Contradicting Reports About the Directors Whereabouts Surface,"Jul 27, 2021","In a new twist to the Africrypt saga, two different reports have made contradicting claims about the whereabouts of Raees and Ameer Cajee, the two directors of the collapse bitcoin investment firm. However, both reports suggest the Cajees brothers had planned their escape prior to the alleged hacking incident in April.In its report, the UK outlet Daily Mail claims to have seen documents suggesting that Raees had purchased Vanuatu citizenship for about $131,000 (£95,000) back in October 2020. About three months later, Ameer would make a similar purchase. The same report quotes Cajees brothers suggesting that their disappearance had been prompted by fears that a criminal gang wanted to harm them.Interestingly, the claims by the brothers that they fled South Africa to avoid being harmed by an organized criminal syndicate appear to be corroborated by a Moneyweb report. In this report, the Cajees brothers are quoted claiming that they had received death threats following the collapse of Africrypt. It is these death threats that Raees uses to justify their joint decision to flee the country.However, in its report, the South African-based Moneyweb appears to contradict the assertion that Raees and his brother are hiding in Vanuatu. Instead, it points to an affidavit signed by Raees which indicates that he may have been in Tanzania when he signed this document. The signing of the affidavit had apparently been prompted by a South African High Court’s decision to grant a provisional liquidation order against Africrypt.As the Moneyweb report notes, in the next few months, the High Court is expected to rule on whether to grant the final order or not. However, before this ruling is delivered, interested parties argue their cases hence Raees’ affidavit.Meanwhile, in his affidavit, Raees again dismisses claims that $3.6 billion in investors’ funds have gone missing under the Cajee brothers’ watch. Instead, Raees suggests that the amount in question is closer to $6 million. Also in his affidavit, Raees rejects allegations that Africrypt had a bank account at FNB or the assertions that the investment company had invested in cryptocurrencies. He also repeats Africrypt management’s long-shot argument that the investment firm should not be held liable for the losses.Is liquidation the best way to recover the vanished investor funds? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

Lee is a former vice president in the Institutional Middle Markets group at Morgan Stanley.Commenting on the price of bitcoin hitting $60,000 earlier this year, Lee said that “it is just a side effect of endless money printing that’s going on.” He dismissed the theory that the BTC price increase Monday resulted from the rumor that Amazon may be accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for payments. The e-commerce giant published a job posting last week seeking a digital currency and blockchain lead.Lee said that “the best days are ahead for cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin.” Noting that “bitcoin is your first mover,” he believes that the cryptocurrency is “going to profit as much or more as any of the other cryptocurrencies.”“I think it’s hard to explain some of these moves, but it’s a very much a momentum asset class,” he continued. “So, as soon as you get a little bit of momentum to the upside, the follow on trades just keep coming and coming and coming. And then all of a sudden you go from $29,000 to almost $40,000 in the span of a little over a week.”Declaring that he is a bitcoin owner, Lee opined, “I think it’s a long time before we see any sort of taper or any sort of restrictive policy from the Fed.” Emphasizing that “it’s not only like that with the Fed, it’s like that with central banks worldwide,” the strategist concluded:That’s why I think bitcoin is likely to make all time new highs, maybe, maybe not in the next few months. But the best days of bitcoin are definitely ahead of it, not behind it.Do you agree with Lee that bitcoin’s best days are head? Let us know in the comments section below.

636,"Tesla Reveals Bitcoin Holdings Worth $1.3 Billion in Q2, $23 Million BTC Impairment","Jul 26, 2021","Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, is holding bitcoin worth $1.311 billion. The company did not buy or sell any bitcoin during the second quarter but recorded bitcoin-related impairment of $23 million. Tesla’s action reaffirms Musk’s prior statement that neither he nor Tesla had sold their coins.Elon Musk’s Tesla released its second-quarter earnings report Monday. The company’s Q2 2021 unaudited balance sheet shows a net digital asset value of $1.311 billion as of June 30.Tesla did not buy or sell any bitcoin in the second quarter. The company’s Q2 unaudited statement of cash flows still shows that the only cryptocurrency purchase made was the $1.5 billion BTC purchase in Q1.The cash flow statement also shows that the only time Tesla sold its bitcoin was in Q1 for $272 million. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously explained that the sale was to prove the liquidity of bitcoin, tweeting on June 13: “Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.”In April, Tesla revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its bitcoin stash was worth $2.5 billion.Tesla’s Q2 earnings report specifically mentions bitcoin once, under the “profitability” section which highlights items offsetting the company’s operating income, including “bitcoin-related impairment of $23M.”According to Tesla’s 10-K form filed with the SEC, the company treats digital assets “as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other,” elaborating:The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.“We will perform an analysis each quarter to identify impairment. If the carrying value of the digital asset exceeds the fair value based on the lowest price quoted in the active exchanges during the period, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference in the consolidated statement of operations,” the company detailed.Tesla’s financial statements confirm Elon Musk’s previous statements that Tesla had diamond hands and would not sell its bitcoins. Musk said on several occasions that neither he nor Tesla had sold any BTC.Tesla started accepting BTC for payments in March but stopped in May. Musk cited environmental issues as the reason and said that Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin when miners confirm they are using 50% clean energy.At the recent Bitcoin event “B Word,” Musk revealed that he personally owns three cryptocurrencies — bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin — while Spacex owns bitcoin. “I might pump but I don’t dump … I would like to see bitcoin succeed,” he said, adding that “Tesla will most likely resume accepting bitcoin.”What do you think about Tesla’s bitcoin strategy?

637,Jeff Bezos Directs Amazon to Accept Bitcoin and Other Popular Cryptocurrencies: Report,"Jul 26, 2021","Amazon is reportedly planning to accept bitcoin for payments, after which the company will roll out support for other major cryptocurrencies. “The directive is coming from the very top … Jeff Bezos himself.”Following the news of Amazon seeking to hire a digital currency and blockchain lead, City A.M. publication reported that the company actually has plans to accept bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies.Citing “an insider” at the company, the news outlet reported that Amazon is looking to accept bitcoin payments “by the end of the year” and the company is also investigating its own token for 2022.Amazon “isn’t just going through the motions to set up cryptocurrency payment solutions at some point in the future,” the insider claims, adding that its crypto project “is a full-on, well-discussed, integral part of the future mechanism of how Amazon will work.” She elaborated:It begins with bitcoin – this is the key first stage of this crypto project, and the directive is coming from the very top … Jeff Bezos himself.“This entire project is pretty much ready to roll,” the insider revealed, emphasizing that “It won’t take long because the plans are already there, and they have been working on them since 2019.”Noting that Amazon’s directors were keen to move forward with adding support for other big cryptocurrencies once a fast and secure method of bitcoin payment is established, she said:Ethereum, cardano and bitcoin cash will be next in line before they bring about eight of the most popular cryptocurrencies online.Besides accepting crypto payments, Amazon is also exploring launching its own coin, the insider explained. “When all these crypto ducks are lined up, there’s another twist to push things even further into Amazon’s favour – a native token,” she opined, adding:After a year of experiencing cryptocurrency as a way of making payments for goods, it is looking increasingly possible that we’re heading towards tokenisation.“This then becomes a multi-level infrastructure where you can pay for goods and services or earn tokens in a loyalty scheme,” she described.Editor’s Note (July 27, 2021, 4:37 p.m. EDT): After publication, Bloomberg reported that a spokesperson for Amazon said: “Notwithstanding our interest in the space, the speculation that has ensued around our specific plans for cryptocurrencies is not true. We remain focused on exploring what this could look like for customers shopping on Amazon … We’re inspired by the innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space and are exploring what this could look like on Amazon. We believe the future will be built on new technologies that enable modern, fast and inexpensive payments, and hope to bring that future to Amazon customers as soon as possible.”Do you think Amazon will accept bitcoin by the end of the year?

638,"Massive Short Squeeze Pushes Bitcoin Closer to $40K, Crypto Economy Jumps 9% Higher","Jul 26, 2021","The price of bitcoin jumped over 15% in a matter of three hours on Sunday evening and came awfully close to the $40K handle. Since then, the crypto asset has dropped back a few percentages and currently hovers above the $38K range. The entire cryptocurrency economy has spiked 9.72% rising to $1.53 trillion in overall value.Bitcoin and digital asset values have risen dramatically during the last 12 hours as bitcoin (BTC) jumped more than 15% yesterday evening (EDT). BTC has managed to hold above the $38K zone on Monday after falling from $39,850 per unit at 9:00 p.m. on Sunday. Bitcoin is still up 12% during the last 24 hours and 24% for the week. Out of the crypto economy’s $1.5 trillion, bitcoin commands 47.1% of that value while ethereum (ETH) commands 17.8%. At the time of writing, BTC is exchanging for $38,489 per coin.The second-largest crypto asset, in terms of market valuation, is ethereum (ETH), which is swapping for $2,345 per coin. ETH has gained 9.59% over the last day and is up 29.47% during the last seven days. The third-largest crypto asset, binance coin (BNB), is up 7.89% during the last 24 hours and 12.6% for the week. Dogecoin (DOGE) has been the biggest gainer in the top ten today as it jumped 15.15% across the last day and is up 29.2% for the week.Today’s biggest gainer out of all 10,000+ crypto assets is the token amp (AMP), up 50.3% during the last day. 24-hour statistics show thorchain (RUNE) is up 23% and bittorrent (BTT) has also gained 23%. Today’s biggest losers include flow (FLOW), down 7.5%, stacks (STX), down 1.7%, and axie infinity (AXS), which lost 1.3% in 24 hours. Market aggregators show there’s an increase in global trade volume today with BTC commanding $38 billion of that volume. Tether (USDT) captures $74 billion and ethereum (ETH) has $24 billion.Speaking with Bitcoin.com News, Etoro’s crypto analyst Simon Peters explained how digital assets saw a phenomenal breakout to start the week. “Crypto has staged a stunning breakout on Monday morning, defying the recent gloom for investors,” Peters wrote. “The bullish trading comes on the back of news over the weekend that Amazon is looking to expand its crypto-asset presence, with the news it was hiring a cryptocurrency and blockchain lead,” Peters said. The crypto analyst added:When Paypal made its announcement, bitcoin languished around $11,700, but the ensuing bull run took the crypto asset to an all-time high of $63,346.Besides the Amazon rumors, most of the action on Sunday evening stemmed from the massive liquidation of short-sellers. Bitcoin.com News reported on a possible short squeeze on July 12, when BTC/USD shorts were starting to stack up. The market report explained that usually, short squeezes occur in the world of bitcoin trading when there’s an unusually high amount of BTC/USD short positions recorded.At times when this trend happens, it triggers an extremely fast pump that leaves short sellers in the dust and in the land of liquidations. Many other analysts and traders assumed this market play was in the cards. Close to $900 million in short positions were liquidated in a 12-hour time span as BTC spiked 15% in value rather quickly. Bybit data shows a great number of traders were “rekt” by the short squeeze and 24-hour liquidation stats now measure $1.15 billion.In another investor’s note sent to Bitcoin.com News, the CEO at crypto trading bot firm Cryptohopper, Ruud Feltkamp, explained that all the market action is simply part of bitcoin’s price cycles. “At a superficial level, the current bull run resembles that of 2017, though that’s technically absurd and illogical. However, if this continues, it would mean that bitcoin should soon reach $50k again,” Feltkamp remarked. The Cryptohopper executive added:The market has been consolidating for some time, and an upturn was expected by many in late summer or early September, as this is part of bitcoin’s yearly cycle. In addition, the decision by Amazon to hire a crypto team and Tesla accepting bitcoin again have given the necessary spark to fire up the cryptocurrency market once more.What do you think about the crypto market action during the last 12 hours and the recent value spikes? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

639,Tesla Q2-2021 Earnings Call to Shed Light on Its Bitcoin Holdings,"Jul 26, 2021","The upcoming Tesla Q2-2021 earnings call, which will be announced this Monday after market hours, will at last shed some light on what has happened with the company’s bitcoin holdings. The company held more than 1.5 billion dollars in bitcoin on Q1 and has reported only one sale to “test the market’s liquidity” according to its CEO, Elon Musk. The cryptocurrency community has been patiently waiting in anticipation to see the disclosures stemming from Tesla’s forthcoming earnings report.The upcoming earnings call of Tesla, the leading electric car manufacturer, has generated expectations in the Bitcoin community due to the large bitcoin (BTC) stash the company holds on its balance sheet. The CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon last quarter when he announced Tesla’s purchase of $1.5 billion earlier this year. The current status of this bitcoin stash is unknown, and it will be revealed on Monday if the company sold, held tightly, or bought the dip during Q2.There is just one publicly recorded sale of Tesla’s bitcoin holdings. The company reportedly sold $272 million in bitcoin last quarter to test the liquidity of the market. At the time, the news created a temporary slump in prices. However, Musk was quick to state that this was just a test to ensure the market could manage these kinds of sales.Then, Musk had a change of heart about the Bitcoin network and its effects on the environment, something that created a schism between the entrepreneur and the crypto community.Tesla stopped supporting bitcoin for payments for electric cars due to environmental concerns stated last May, a fact that started the recommendations for a more effective and greener cryptocurrency for payments by the company. At that time, Musk also signaled his personal preference for dogecoin (DOGE) and announced the changes the Dogecoin network would have to complete to fulfill this role. Dogecoin developers have been prepping the network so it can offer cheaper transaction fees.At the B Word event, a cryptocurrency conference that took place this week, Musk stated he would like for bitcoin to succeed, even after his harsh criticism of the currency. Musk hinted Tesla’s holdings were still intact when he declared “I might pump but I don’t dump.” But, due to the mixed signals offered by Musk, the only trustable data on the subject will be released next Monday.What do you think about Tesla’s position on Bitcoin and its holdings?

640,Portfolio Strategist Expects Cardano to Become Mainstream Cryptocurrency Alongside Bitcoin and Ether,"Jul 25, 2021","A portfolio strategist for American financial services firm Morningstar says that cardano could become a mainstream cryptocurrency alongside bitcoin and ether, forming a “big three” of mainstream cryptocurrencies.Amy Arnott, a cryptocurrency-focused portfolio strategist at Morningstar, shared her views on crypto regulation, ether, and cardano in an interview with the Insider last week.Noting that since many cryptocurrencies are not cash-generating, Arnott said it is difficult to determine a suitable price for them. However, she explained that ether has an in-built price to an extent because it is used to power decentralized finance (defi) transactions and support non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The strategist elaborated:The fact that ether is used as a utility should provide some sort of price floor, but I’m not sure what that should be. A lot of people talk about a network effect where these currencies become more valuable as they are used more and there are more interdependencies and connections.Arnott also believes that cardano (ADA) is a promising cryptocurrency that could join bitcoin and ether to form a “big three” of mainstream cryptocurrencies. She elaborated:Cardano is similar to ethereum in that it’s a protocol that has a lot of potential technical applications. There’s a lot of enthusiasm about cardano, and also various stablecoins.The Morningstar strategist continued to share her view on the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. “The interesting thing that’s happened over the past year or so is that institutional investors have been far more willing to adopt cryptocurrencies and look at them as an investment asset. As that trend continues we’ll see other cryptocurrencies become more mainstream,” she opined.She noted that she would really like to see a diversified cryptocurrency index fund in the form of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still has not approved any crypto ETF, making it “very difficult for mainstream investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.” Arnott opined:Regulatory risk is a big issue – that’s been the driving factor behind a lot of the volatility over the past few months. If governments around the world clamp down on crypto in general, or bitcoin and ether specifically, that would be a large negative.What do you think about the comments by the Morningstar strategist?

641,Jack Dorsey Calls Bitcoin a 'Big Part' of Twitter's Future as a Global Currency,"Jul 25, 2021","Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says that bitcoin will be a big part of the company’s future. “If the Internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, Commerce, Subscriptions, Tip Jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet,” he said.Twitter announced its quarterly earnings Thursday that beat analysts’ forecasts. During the company’s Q2 earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey said that bitcoin would be a “big part” of the company’s future.Dorsey said during the call: “There are three trends relevant to Twitter and you, our shareholders: AI, decentralization, and the Internet finally having access to a global native currency in bitcoin. All these will help us do our jobs better, and we intend to lead the way in each.”During the Q&A part of the call, Douglass Anmuth, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co., asked Dorsey about how he sees bitcoin becoming more integrated into Twitter, particularly around some of the newer products like Super Follows and Spaces, and how they can drive both engagement and monetization for Twitter over time.“I’ve been tweeting and talking a lot about Bitcoin,” Dorsey replied. “Focusing on the use case of the Internet having native currency and that bitcoin probably is the best, actually known to be the best candidate for that role, that’s what I think we should really focus on.”The CEO added: “If the Internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, Commerce, Subscription, Tip Jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet because of that instead of going down on market-by-market approach.” He further opined:I think this is a big part of our future. I think there’s a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralizing social media more and providing more economic incentive. So I think it’s hugely important to Twitter and to Twitter shareholders that we continue to look at the space and invest aggressively in it.“There’s an obvious need for this and appreciation for it. And I think an open standard that’s native to one of that is the right way to go, which is where, why my focus … our focus … should be on Bitcoin. So I do think it allows speed. It allows a lot more innovation, and it really opens up entirely new use cases for everyone on Twitter,” he opined.Last week, Dorsey said that his other company, Square Inc., is developing a new business focused on “decentralized financial services” using bitcoin.Dorsey was recently also featured speaker at the bitcoin event “B Word” alongside Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management (Ark Invest) CEO Cathie Wood.What do you think about Twitter saying that bitcoin will be a big part of its future?

642,This Year's Gallup Poll Findings Suggest 6% of US Investors Own Bitcoin,"Jul 25, 2021","Young U.S. investors are more interested in bitcoin investments than they were three years ago, according to a poll stemming from the Gallup Investor Optimism Index. This year’s poll surveyed 1,037 participants and findings suggest 6% of American investors own bitcoin. The American survey and analytics firm Gallup has published new findings from a recent survey the company did on bitcoin investing. The firm’s survey called the Gallup Investor Optimism Index explains there is “more momentum among investors younger than 50.”In 2018, Gallup’s last report had shown that only 2% of investors own bitcoin but in 2021, that metric has increased to 6%. The American adults that participated said they owned roughly $10K in investments like equities and bonds. Further, Gallup’s researchers say that the number of owners increases for younger generations.“Ownership is up a more impressive 10 percentage points, to 13%, among investors aged 18 to 49,” Gallup’s latest report notes. “It remains minimal among investors aged 50 and older; just 3% now say they own it, versus 1% three years ago.” Gallup’s report adds:8% of those with less than $100,000 invested and 6% of those with $100,000 or more invested currently own it. Separately, Gallup finds male investors are over three times as active as female investors in the bitcoin market, with 11% of male investors and 3% of female investors now owners.Gallup’s study says that bitcoin owners can be compared with mainstream investments like stocks and mutual funds. 84% of those polled invested in either stock or mutual funds while 67% owned individual equities. Researchers note that bitcoin investing is “more akin to gold” which captures 11% of the investor’s portfolio, while 50% of respondents hold bonds.Adversity toward bitcoin has softened since the last survey as well, as only 58% said they have zero interest in investing. In 2018, 72% of the polled participants said they have no interest in ever buying bitcoin. Adding to the 6% who already own bitcoin, another 2% said they will likely purchase the crypto asset in the future. 35% of those polled, stressed that they are intrigued by bitcoin but “won’t be buying it anytime soon.”Gallup’s poll concludes by noting that three years ago, a very small percentage of American investors were interested in bitcoin and a very small fraction owned the crypto asset. Since then, researchers attribute the growth to easier purchasing methods and “large investments in bitcoin by well-known companies such as Tesla, Square, and Morgan Stanley.”“Perhaps, as a result, bitcoin is inching closer to general acceptance among U.S. investors,” Gallup researchers conclude. “Particularly with those under age 50. Not only do 13% of these relatively young investors own it, but their familiarity with it and willingness to buy it have risen to majority levels.”What do you think about the 2021 Gallup poll about bitcoin ownership?

643,Strategist Mike McGlone Believes Bitcoin Can Jump to $60K Resistance vs. $20K Support,"Jul 25, 2021","The senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, has been long on bitcoin for a while now and he said last month that bitcoin has a “bullish ace up its sleeve.” This week the strategist’s analysis notes that bitcoin prices will likely revert toward the $60K handle in contrast to the $20K support range.On July 23, Bloomberg’s senior exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas shared a screenshot of Mike McGlone’s written statement concerning current bitcoin markets. After tapping a high of $35,960 on July 4, the leading crypto asset tumbled to a low of $29,300 per unit 19 days later. On July 24, bitcoin (BTC) managed to climb back toward the $34K region as there’s been a slight trend reversal during the last 48 hours.“Our crypto analyst Mike McGlone says bitcoin [is] more likely to hit $60k than $20k based on historical price patterns,” Balchunas tweeted on Friday. “[McGlone] also says China’s rejection of open-source software crypto assets may mark [a] plateau in [the] country’s economic ascent,” Balchunas added. A few individuals responded to McGlone’s take and one person said:That’s a hot take on China. Rejecting things like this typically shows a fear that something is better than your own currency. Every Country that rejects Bitcoin is SCREAMING the same thing.Balchunas replied to the comment and said it reminded him of some old jokes. “Reminds me of the Chuck Norris jokes for some reason. China doesn’t reject bitcoin, bitcoin rejects China,” Balchunas said.As far as McGlone’s bitcoin (BTC) price forecast is concerned, the ETF analyst’s screenshot of McGlone’s outlook said:Bitcoin is more likely to revert toward $60,000 resistance vs. $20,000 support, if its history of recovering from similar too-cold conditions are any guide. Our graphic depicts the benchmark crypto akin to the 2018-2019 consolidation period of around $4,000, just before launching to the 2019 peak at about $14,000. The more tactical-trading-oriented bears seem to proliferate when Bitcoin sustains at about 30% threshold below its 20-week moving average, allowing the buy-and-hold types time to accumulate.Besides China, regulators have been cracking down on cryptocurrency operations worldwide. Government officials in Europe want to ban anonymous transactions and the European Commission has proposed legislation to “ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers.”In addition to the regulatory climate, global markets, in general, are a touch shaken by the narrative surrounding the Covid Delta variant. While lots of people responding to Balchunas’ Twitter thread agreed with McGlone, one individual said he only agreed with one specific part of the statement where he said bitcoin is more likely to hit $60K than $20K.This isn’t the first time McGlone has made such predictions concerning bitcoin‘s future price. Last month, the senior commodity strategist said “$40,000 appears more likely than $20,000” and the latest $60K call is a lot more optimistic.What do you think about Mike McGlone’s bitcoin price outlook?

644,Group of Salvadorans Take to the Streets to Protest El Salvador's New Bitcoin Law,"Jul 24, 2021","While some Salvadorans situated near Playa El Zonte beach like the new bitcoin tender law implemented by Nayib Bukele’s regime, a number of other citizens dislike the law. This week, regional reports show citizens from El Salvador have taken to the streets to protest the bitcoin tender law.One might think from some of the fluffy reports stemming from a number of cryptocurrency magazines that all is swell in El Salvador in regard to the new bitcoin law. However, during the first week of July, a survey conducted by Disruptiva polled 1,233 people residing in El Salvador and a majority of Salvadorans said they were skeptical of bitcoin as a currency. Following the implementation of the new bitcoin tender law, leaked reports claimed Nayib Bukele’s government cohorts were planning to launch a stablecoin.Now a regional report from the news outlet El Mundo shows a number of Salvadorans have taken to the streets to protest the bitcoin law. Marchers gathered together to speak out against Bukele’s tender law and said the crypto asset was “too volatile.”There’s also a resistance group called the “Popular Resistance and Rebellion Block” group, which has written a letter to Bukele’s regime saying the law is unconstitutional. The group says bureaucrats under the control of Bukele did not consult the citizenry first and they stressed the president’s move was akin to playing “the lottery.”Nayib Bukele is considered an authoritarian leader and recently mandated that citizens must take Covid-19 vaccines, despite the pushback against the experimental drugs. A number of mainstream American news publications have called El Salvador’s president a “dictator.” Last May, Bukele’s New Ideas Party fired several Supreme Court members and the attorney general.Bukele even tweeted about the removal and exclaimed the representatives had been “dismissed.” People believe the members were fired because the Supreme Court ruled a few times that Bukele made unconstitutional mistakes. The Salvadoran attorney general was investigating several of the Bukele regime’s ministers.On May 4, U.S. vice president Kamala Harris spoke about the Salvadoran nation in a speech. “Just this weekend, we learned that the Salvadoran parliament moved to undermine its nation’s highest court. An independent judiciary is critical to a healthy democracy and a strong economy. On this front — on every front — we must respond.”Protestors who dislike the new bitcoin law also believe Bukele’s New Ideas Party is in the wrong. The Popular Resistance and Rebellion Block group stressed:Bitcoin only serves some large businessmen, especially those linked to the government, to launder ill-gotten money.While the supermajority in the Salvadoran congress passed the law, bitcoin (BTC) won’t officially be recognized until September 7, 2021. Protestors hope that in the interim, Salvadoran lawmakers will stop Bukele’s New Ideas Party from successfully implementing the legislation. Meanwhile, a few Salvadorans disliked the group’s protest and said: “How can they be called resistance and rebellion? Hahaha… Bitcoin is true financial freedom.”“Sad to see people who seek to go backward and limit the growth of the country,” another individual added.What do you think about the protestors who dislike the new Salvadoran bitcoin tender law?

646,New York Town Bemoans Roadside ‘Littered’ With Bitcoin Miners — Officials Plan to Impose 90-Day Moratorium,"Jul 24, 2021","A St. Lawrence county town located in New York near the Canadian border, Massena, is another region in the state that is having issues with bitcoin miners. According to recent reports from the local WWNY-TV news desk and Reuters, the Massena town supervisor is drafting new regulations for bitcoin mining operations.The town of Massena, with a population of around 13K, has attracted bitcoin miners according to a report from Reuters. The New York town’s officials have taken issue with bitcoin miners and the authorities plan to impose a 90-day moratorium on any new bitcoin miners looking to tap into the town’s energy sources.According to Massena Town Supervisor Steve O’Shaughnessy, the town doesn’t want Massena’s roadsides to be filled with shipping containers that house mining rigs.“We don’t want it littered with these trailers that are pumping out bitcoin,” O’Shaughnessy told WWNY-TV. “We just want to make sure if they’re going to come here, that it’s a nice presentable building,” he added.The report notes that there’s been a surge of cryptocurrency miners setting up shop in Massena. The electrical company Massena Electric is currently in the midst of negotiations with three prospective operations.“The key components for the developers is low-cost electricity and reliability, which are two things we’ve always had,” Andrew McMahon, Massena Electric’s superintendent said. Reports say Route 42 in Massena near Fort Covington has numerous mobile bitcoin mining units that are housed in shipping containers.Massena Electric told WWNY-TV that the deals with bitcoin miners always come second to current customers but “customers could even benefit from the increased sales.”The crypto mining operation Petawatt Group is located in Massena, as the firm was able to purchase 140 acres of land two years ago. Petawatt Group and its co-founder Jason Rappaport say bitcoin mining operations can potentially bring jobs to Massena locals.“We’re not like some new operation that decamped from somewhere else and coming in and trying to find power, you know, relatively inexpensively, and not being part of the community,” Rappaport stressed to the local news station.New York and bitcoin miners have seemed to go hand-in-hand because of the state’s abundant access to cheap hydropower. However, residents and officials from a few New York communities have taken issue with bitcoin miners in a similar fashion.For instance, residents who live alongside Seneca Lake blamed bitcoin mining for heating up the water. The lake was “so warm you feel like you’re in a hot tub,” a report by NBC News noted at the time.Democrat senator Kevin Parker also introduced a bill that seeks to establish a three-year moratorium on any bitcoin mining operations in the state. The Committee on Environmental Conservation reviewed the bill on May 3.The bill declared that cryptocurrency miners should be responsible for the environmental impacts the industry might cause the state. Senator Parker insists cryptocurrency mining has a negative environmental impact and mining businesses would have to pass state greenhouse gas emission targets in order to continue.What do you think about the issues bitcoin miners are having in Massena, New York?

Meanwhile, his companies, Spacex and Tesla, own bitcoin. He also said that bitcoin’s energy usage “is shifting a lot more toward renewables,” and Tesla will likely resume accepting the cryptocurrency after he does more due diligence.The Bitcoin event “B Word,” which took place Wednesday, featured a live discussion with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon musk, Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. The discussion was moderated by Steve Lee, head of Square Crypto.Responding to the question of what influenced his view on bitcoin, Musk began by outlining the benefits of the cryptocurrency. Tesla’s Technoking, who wore an evolution of money t-shirt during the live discussion, then said, “It’s got a lot of potential.”Emphasizing, “I’m not an investor,” Musk said that the only significant publicly traded stocks he owns are the Tesla and Spacex stocks. He continued:Apart from that, I do own bitcoin. Tesla owns bitcoin. Spacex owns bitcoin … And I personally own a bit of ethereum and dogecoin.Musk affirmed, “In general, I am a supporter of bitcoin,” emphasizing, “The bitcoin I own is worth a lot more than ethereum or doge.”Indicating that he doesn’t believe in selling after helping to boost prices, he opined:If the price of bitcoin goes down, I lose money … I might pump but I don’t dump … I would like to see bitcoin succeed.Turning to the subject of Tesla halting acceptance of bitcoin, Musk explained that the suspension was temporary. He confirmed: “We are not selling any bitcoin, nor am I selling it personally, nor is Spacex selling any bitcoin.”Regarding Bitcoin’s energy usage, Musk conceded: “It looks like Bitcoin is shifting a lot more toward renewables and a bunch of the heavy-duty coal plants that were being used … have been shut down, especially in China.”He added, “I want to do a little more due diligence to confirm that the percentage of renewable energy usage is most likely at or above 50% and that there is a trend toward increasing that number,” elaborating:If so, Tesla will most likely resume accepting bitcoin.What do you think about Elon Musk’s comments?

Employees routinely cited “opportunities,” “teamwork,” “diversity” and “experience” as some of the strongest selling points of working at Bitcoin of America.To put those numbers into perspective, only 59 percent of employees at typical American companies consider their place of employment to be “a great place to work.” Bitcoin of America, which is registered as a money services business with the United States Department of Treasury (FinCEN)(RegNum), instead offers its employees a vastly different experience, according to the annual survey.There’s a very good reason why employees often mentioned “diversity” as one of the major reasons why Bitcoin of America should be classified as “a great place to work.” The company employees three female executives — COO Samantha Miller, Director of Marketing/Head of Tablet Sales Jenna Polinsky and Director of Business Development Alice Gorodetsky— among its leadership team. That is a rarity in the mostly male worlds of technology and cryptocurrency — something that Miller, Gorodetsky, and Polinsky were reminded of recently while representing BoA at Bitcoin international conferences in Miami and Las Vegas. Bitcoin of America’s employee excitement is one of the reasons that it has quickly evolved into one of the nation’s leading Bitcoin ATM vendors. In a matter of four years, Bitcoin of America has expanded from one Bitcoin ATM in Chicago (Machine No. 109 in the world at the time) to more than 1,500 plus ATMs and wireless locations across 31 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. This is a press release.

649,"Viking Silver Found on Isle of Man Represents 1,000-Year-Old Analog Version of Bitcoin","Jul 21, 2021","Off the coast of the Irish Sea, humans have lived on the Isle of Man since before 6500 B.C. The island has a robust history of Viking Age treasures. According to a recent announcement from Manx National Heritage, a heritage agency located there, an amateur treasure hunter recently discovered a hoard of Viking silver on the island. U.S.-based researcher and numismatist, Dr. Kristin Bornholdt-Collins, said the unearthed Viking silver hoard was similar to today’s cryptocurrency and embodied a 1,000-year-old comparison to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.Just recently, an amateur treasure hunter searching for trinkets on the Isle of Man found a hoard of Viking silver otherwise known as “hack silver.” Manx National Heritage disclosed that the stash of ancient money contained 87 silver coins, 13 pieces of silver arm-rings, and a small fraction of other numismatic artifacts. The Viking stash was discovered in April when Kath Giles was hoovering around with a metal detector on private land.Giles’ discovery was the third major treasure find on the Island of Man in less than six months, and Giles has managed to dig up at least four significant treasure finds in three years. Dr. Kristin Bornholdt-Collins, an independent researcher and numismatist based in New Hampshire, U.S., explained that the silver includes Dublin-minted pennies and “long cross” pennies which could be cut in half.The Manx National Heritage announcement notes that the Viking coins have a “90% silver content.” The stash of coins Giles discovered is referred to as a “mixed hoard of Viking Age silver coins.”Experts believe mixed hoards of money stemmed from owners who planned to reclaim the stash of money at a later date. Bornholdt-Collins says the stash is used like a “piggybank” and could be considered a 1,000-year-old analog version of cryptocurrency.“The Northern Mixed hoard is the fourth Viking-Age coin hoard to be found in the Isle of Man in the last fifty years,” Bornholdt-Collins said. “It may have been added to over time, like a piggybank, accounting for some of the older coins, though for the most part, it is a direct reflection of what was circulating in and around Man in the late 1020s/c. 1030.”“In addition to the array of coins,” Bornholdt-Collins added, “both hoards contain a significant hack-silver or bullion portion, which would have been weighed out and possibly tested for its quality in the course of transactions. This is generally expected in finds dating to the ninth and tenth centuries from Viking regions, but appears to be a special feature of the later Manx hoards, too. This may be because bullion was especially convenient for international trade since it was practical for any size transaction and was decentralized, a currency without borders or political affiliation.”The New Hampshire-based numismatist further said:In this sense, it was a modern-day equivalent to a cryptocurrency — We might even say it was something like the original ‘Bitcoin.’ It seems only logical, then, that it was so popular in a cosmopolitan trading hub like Man, even several decades into the 11th century, when closely regulated minted silver was well on its way to becoming the norm across Northern Europe.The Manx National Heritage team believes the coin stemmed from around A.D. 1035 and researchers believe the Viking silver was “built up over a period of a few years, perhaps representing a short-term savings account.” According to the Isle of Man heritage agency, the Viking silver will be showcased at the Viking Gallery at the Manx Museum.The stash will then be reviewed by the Treasure Valuation Committee at the British Museum in order to provide advice to the heritage agency on caring for the antiquities found. It is assumed that the latest treasure hoard of Viking silver derived from the time of the Hiberno-Norse king Sihtric Silkbeard.What do you think about the Viking silver found on the Isle of Man and why it is considered an analog version of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin?

650,MTI Investors Urged to Ignore Fake Bitcoin Recovery Offers,"Jul 20, 2021","Beleaguered Mirror Trading International (MTI) investors have been told to ignore unsolicited offers from individuals claiming to have the ability to trace and recover their missing bitcoins. This warning from the court-appointed liquidators was made after reports emerged that several MTI investors had received such bogus offers from individuals claiming to be agents for cryptocurrency organizations.According to a report, these so-called agents have been asking MTI investors that may be interested in their services to pay them in bitcoins. However, in his warning to investors, MTI joint liquidator Adriaan van Rooyen dismisses the agents’ claims. He said:We have information that MTI members are being contacted by people purporting to be agents with access to MTI’s database. These agents are falsely claiming they can recover bitcoin deposited by members into MTI. This is clearly yet another attempt to defraud members of the MTI. Only the provisional liquidators have access to the MTI database, and only the provisional liquidators can disburse recovered bitcoin to members.Instead of responding to the bogus claims, van Rooyen reminded MTI investors that wish to recover their missing bitcoins that they have a better chance if they cooperate with the court-appointed liquidators. According to the MTI liquidators, investors can kickstart this cooperation by registering and submitting their claims online.Meanwhile, on the webpage that has specifically been created for this registration process, the liquidators explain how MTI investors are supposed to submit their claims. However, the liquidators warn that each and every claim will be verified and investors submitting more than one claim will see such claims rejected.How do you rate MTI investors’ chances of recovering their invested funds?

651,"Bitcoin Slides Under $30K, Stablecoins Eclipse Trade Volumes, Crypto Interest Depletes","Jul 20, 2021","The price of bitcoin has slid under the $30K zone on Tuesday, dipping to $29,300 per unit during the early morning trading sessions (EDT). The global cryptocurrency market capitalization of all the crypto coins in existence is $1.19 trillion as it decreased by more than 6% in the last day.Digital currency markets have lost considerable value during the last week and seven-day stats show a number of coins have shed double-digit percentages. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading for $29,656 per unit at the time of writing, down 5% during the last 24 hours. Weekly statistics show BTC is down more than 10% and holds a $556 billion market valuation. BTC’s market cap has shaved off $19 billion since yesterday.Today, BTC commands 46.7% of the $1.19 trillion, while ethereum (ETH) captures 17.1%. Ethereum is swapping for $1,757 per unit, down 5.7% on Tuesday and seven-day statistics show ETH is down 11.9%. The biggest loser in the top ten crypto market cap positions is polkadot (DOT), which has bled 26% this past week. Cardano (ADA) has lost 19.3% and dogecoin (DOGE) over 18% this week.Besides the coin unus sed leo (LEO), the top market performers today are all stablecoins. These include DAI, TUSD, BUSD, USDC, USDT, HUSD, UST, and PAX, respectively. 52.18% of BTC’s market share is traded in USDT, and 51.09% of ETH trades are also in tether (USDT). 24-hour volume between all crypto assets in existence has jumped over 15% today and is around $67.7 billion. Tether (USDT) commands $47.7 billion of that volume, which is 70.45% of all the global trades recorded on Tuesday morning, according to cryptocompare.com data.In addition to markets seeing a slump, interest in digital assets has been lagging a great deal according to data from Google Trends. Coin Metrics’ authors Nate Maddrey and Kyle Waters explain in the latest “State of the Network” issue 112, that crypto Google search trends have been lackluster.“Worldwide Google search volume for bitcoin shows that interest levels closely followed BTC’s rapid price movements this year and tend to track major changes in price historically. While Google Trends data is not absolute search volume for bitcoin, it does show the relative level of popularity for bitcoin searches over time,” the author’s report explains. Coin Metrics adds:Relative search interest this year for bitcoin has not yet surpassed levels achieved in late 2017. This might be a sign that many retail investors and the general public were already aware of bitcoin prior to the recent price movements this year. Institutional adoption is a big reason for bitcoin’s recent successes in 2020/2021 which will not be captured easily from Google search interest.Similarly, ethereum (ETH) searches on Google Trends are also lower than the number of queries three months ago. No one knows exactly where the crypto market is going and the latest downfall has been attributed to the issues with bitcoin mining in China and the regulatory crackdown worldwide. This week in the U.S., the New Jersey Bureau of Securities told the crypto firm Blockfi that it needs to stop accepting new interest account users in New Jersey.“All aspects of the Blockfi platform continue to be accessible to our clients in New Jersey,” Blockfi’s CEO and founder Zac Prince said. “The order calls for Blockfi to stop accepting new BIA clients residing in New Jersey beginning July 22, 2021.” Furthermore, on Monday afternoon, senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., explained that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau needs to supervise cryptocurrency risks.What do you think about the recent crypto market action and bitcoin price downturn?

652,EtherLite (ETL) Token Is Now Listed on Bitcoin.com Exchange,"Jul 20, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. Bitcoin.com Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of ETL, being available to trade on the 19th July 2021 at 16:00 UTC. ETL was created by the EtherLite team, as the utility token for their borderless, decentralized network with validators and community members from all around the world. ETL will start trading with USDT and ETH pairs.EtherLite uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model as it seeks to pick off where its much larger peer, Ethereum, leaves off. In fact, EtherLite is a hard fork of Ethereum, representing a major change in the code of the larger blockchain that took place in May.EtherLite has been moving through its roadmap, which in addition to the hard fork has included an air drop and an initial exchange offering. Now it’s time for the token to hit exchanges. The EtherLite team says that ETL has been audited by “top core experts” and is poised to begin trading on exchanges in July. They are quite ambitious and are calling it the “year of EtherLite.”EtherLite is a hard fork of Ethereum, which is the go-to blockchain for smart contracts, DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more. The up-and-coming chain is designed to address some of the shortcomings still plaguing the Ethereum network. While there is only one Ethereum, EtherLite has the advantage of hindsight. It boasts features such as:One of EtherLite’s key features is that it is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), according to the project’s website. This means that developers can also use their decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts built on Ethereum on EtherLite. EtherLite makes it easy for devs to “port their existing Ethereum-based dApps in a matter of minutes,” according to the project’s website.Everything that happens on EtherLite is fueled by ETL. It is the EtherLite network’s native coin. It is used to sustain the network, and to pay the network fees. By holding ETL, participants are able to access EtherLite’s core functionalities:EtherLite runs on a Proof-of-Stake mechanism which requires ETL to sustain the network. Validator nodes are required to stake a minimum of 100,000 ETL and in return, validators will receive rewards and fees for their service. If a validator does a malicious activity, then his staked ETL tokens are basically confiscated.The ETL token is ideal for sending and receiving payments thanks to the EtherLite network’s high-throughput, fast finality, and low fees. On EtherLite, money transfers take place within seconds and it costs much less.ETL is used to pay for general network fees, such as transaction fees to access and support network operations.Along with network fees, rewards in the EtherLite ecosystem are distributed using ETLs.Danish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com Exchange, shared his views on EtherLite: “I believe the team behind EtherLite has built an outstanding blockchain platform built for efficiency, it provides a fast, secure and cheaper environment for building decentralized applications, which is very much needed right now in the market.” Chaudhry continues on by saying; “We’re very excited to see how EtherLite, via their ETL token will continue to empower their vision of next-gen blockchain for the current DeFi landscape, and gain further outreach with our outstanding community at the exchange.”The Etherlite Foundation stated that: “The journey of blockchain development has been exponential, all with the onset of powerful collaborations. EtherLite and Bitcoin.com Exchange are coming together to create even significant applications for blockchain. Bitcoin.com Exchange with their massive audience reach will make a great difference to our vision and put EtherLite on the map within the crypto community. We look forward to this continued partnership.” About Bitcoin.com ExchangeThe mission of Bitcoin.com Exchange is to empower people from all over the world to trade cryptocurrencies with ease and confidence, from first-time traders to advanced trading professionals. With high liquidity, 24/7 multilingual support and dozens of trading pairs, complemented with a high level of security, it offers an attractive platform for trading any cryptocurrency. Within one year since launch, on average, the exchange has been visited by more than 500K active traders per month, and this number continues to grow as you read this sentence. About EtherLiteEtherLite is a pure POS based blockchain network, surfacing to create a space where all the major DApps can be bought over under one roof and dealt with in a cost-effective manner, expanding the base of blockchain development and usage in the community.

654,Museum of Bitcoin Mining History Opens Its Doors in Venezuela,"Jul 20, 2021","A new museum dedicated to the history of bitcoin mining opened its doors in Venezuela last weekend. The institution will allow visitors to learn about the history of cryptocurrency mining, going from its roots to the current state of the mining industry. The museum is part of a private initiative started by Criptoavila, a mining-dedicated company.A newly created Museum of Bitcoin Mining History opened its doors to the public in Venezuela last weekend. The new initiative pushed by Criptoavila, a private company whose members have nine years of experience in the mining business, aims to introduce people to the world of bitcoin mining. The museum, which is located in Caracas, will be open to all audiences and will be free to enter.According to Criptonoticias, the exhibition will show the evolution of Bitcoin mining since its central processing unit (CPU) origins, passing through the graphics processing unit (GPU) mining stage. Then finally arriving at the current application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or integrated circuit (IC) mining era that the industry is experiencing. One of the objectives of this museum is to increase awareness about bitcoin mining in the general population, as Joan Telo, a member of Criptoavila stated. He stressed:We decided to take this step because, until now, there is no, or at least not publicly, place where people can observe evolution and we felt it was necessary.Telo also stated they would be adding new equipment to keep up-to-date with the latest trends in mining. He declared:Our idea is to add equipment to the museum as we get them because we want to be a world reference on this issue of the evolutionary process of cryptocurrency mining.While Venezuela’s government has now recognized and legalized bitcoin mining in the country, it was not always like this. Miners in the country often operated underground and there have been some horror stories of authorities abusing miners, arresting them, and confiscating their mining equipment.Now times have changed, and miners only need to be registered and licensed by the national cryptocurrency watchdog (Sunacrip) to operate. But some are still operating without these permits due to fears and general lack of knowledge, leaving them vulnerable to equipment seizures and fines from the government. For example, 400 mining machines were just seized in two operations in June due to a lack of permits.According to the University of Cambridge, Venezuela was in the top ten countries worldwide providing hashrate for the Bitcoin (BTC) network, with 0.42% as of April last year.What do you think about the first Venezuelan Bitcoin mining museum? Tell us in the comments section below.

655,Investment Advisor Says Bitcoin Is 'Very Dangerous to Hold Today' Citing Warnings by Regulators,"Jul 19, 2021","Investment advisor and former Prudent Bear Fund manager David Tice has warned about investing in bitcoin. Citing “negative statements” by central bankers and regulators, such as the Bank of England, he said that it is “very dangerous to hold” bitcoin today.David Tice, who sold his bear fund as the 2008 financial crisis was unfolding, talked about the stock market and bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Friday. A former Prudent Bear Fund manager, Tice is known for making bearish bets during bull markets. He now advises the Advisorshares Ranger Equity Bear exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has $70 million in assets under management.Tice was a bitcoin bull early this year but he became bearish when the price of the cryptocurrency hit all-time highs in March. He now cautioned investors in the crypto space that BTC is very dangerous to hold right now.“We had a bitcoin position when bitcoin was at $10,000. However, when it got to $60,000, we felt like that was long in the tooth,” he described, elaborating:Lately, there’s been a lot more uproar from central bankers, Bank for International Settlements, [and] the Bank of England have made profound negative statements. I think it’s very dangerous to hold today.Bitcoin is not the only market Tick thinks it is dangerous to be in. He also believes it is very dangerous to be in the stock market. “The market is very overpriced in terms of future earnings. We are adding debt like we’ve never seen. We have the Treasury market acting very strange with rates falling dramatically,” he detailed.The Bank of England has been quite vocal in expressing its view on cryptocurrency. The governor of the British central bank, Andrew Bailey, said in May that cryptocurrencies were dangerous and had no intrinsic value. He said investors should put money in cryptocurrencies if they expect to lose it all. The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, agreed with him.Bailey also predicted that cryptocurrencies will not last. In addition, he said in June that “There will inevitably be elements of tough love” in crypto regulation.Last week, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said he believes that cryptocurrencies were not big enough to pose financial stability risk.What do you think about David Tice’s comments?

656,"Bitcoin's Value Dropped 8% This Week, Analyst Says Equities Correction Could Impact Crypto","Jul 19, 2021","Digital currency markets have slipped in value this week as bitcoin has shed more than 8% of its value over the last seven days. The entire market capitalization of all 10,000+ crypto assets has also dropped 3.4% in value to $1.25 trillion on Monday. Crypto markets are following the trend of large drops seen across stock markets on Monday morning, as equities have significantly decreased in value. Bitcoin dropped to a low of $30,400 on July 19, losing approximately 8.64% during the last week as the leading crypto asset slid 3.3% in 24 hours. Bitcoin’s market valuation is $575 billion at the time of writing and there’s $19 billion worth of BTC trade volume on Monday.The top five trading pairs with BTC include USDT, USD, BUSD, JPY, and EUR. The stablecoin tether (USDT) commands over 56% of today’s BTC trades. Out of the $1.25 trillion, BTC captures 46.4% of the overall valuation, while ethereum (ETH) commands 17% of the entire crypto economy.The second-largest crypto asset, in terms of market capitalization, is ethereum (ETH) and ether has lost over 13% this week. ETH is also down over 6% during the last 24 hours and has around $14 billion in global trade volume.The biggest seven-day losers on Monday include thorchain (RUNE) which is down over 40% and synthetix (SNX) down over 37%. The top three leading crypto assets on Monday include nem (XEM) up 6.8% this week, unus sed leo (LEO) up 1.9%, and hedera hashgraph (HBAR) which is up 1.4%.In a note sent to Bitcoin.com News, Pankaj Balani, CEO of the crypto trading platform Delta Exchange, explains the risk of dropping below $30K is now higher.“Bitcoin failed above $33,000 and is trading around $31,800 on the spot market,” Balani said. “Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase and is trying to settle in the $30,000-$40,000 range. Having said that, BTC has found it challenging to move higher and the upper end of this range has been converging gradually.” The Delta Exchange executive further added:Bitcoin failed above $36,000 last week and $33,000 this week. We have also continuously tested the bottom end of the above range which shows weakness in price and opens up the risk of a breakdown below $30,000. Overall, the risk of downside below 30,000 on Bitcoin is much higher now than what it was in the months of May and June.Alex Kuptsikevich, the Fxpro senior financial analyst, told Bitcoin.com News that an S&P 500 correction could negatively affect the overall crypto economy. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 700 points, while Nasdaq, NYSE, and tech stocks have also shed significant value on Monday.“The Bitcoin network’s hash rate has never recovered to its peak and is currently at levels of late October 2019,” Kuptsikevich said. “An automatic decline should soon follow this in complexity. It is accepted that Bitcoin’s price follows the hash rate/complexity of mining, so the investment outlook is deteriorating for now.” Kuptsikevich’s analysis continued:A correction in the S&P 500 could negatively contribute to the short-term dynamics of the crypto market. In this case, a correlation of the benchmark equity index and Bitcoin may well show its full potential, as similar cautionary sentiment prevails in both markets.Etoro’s senior analyst, Simon Peters, says that despite short-term corrections, long-term outlooks are still quite positive.“Recent harsh conditions for bitcoin and ether continued last week as both crypto assets saw significant sell-offs continue,” Peters explained to Bitcoin.com News on Monday. “Bitcoin’s recent woes deepened as the crypto asset slumped across the week, starting trading above $34,000 before losing ground. Likewise, ether has come down heavily from recent highs. ETH began the week above $2,000 but saw a quick sell off to trade below $1,900 at times,” the Etoro analyst added.“With yet another poor performing week,” Peters added, “speculation on the short-term price direction of major crypto assets is rife, with mixed opinions on price depending on what metric/indicators analysts are looking at.” Peters’ investors note to Bitcoin.com News concluded: “Long-term confidence remains high, however, with a recent survey of Fintech experts revealing more than half believe bitcoin is capable of becoming the global reserve currency by 2050.”What do you think about the crypto economy’s recent downturn?

657,Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion Mike Tyson Asks Fans if They Prefer Bitcoin or Ethereum,"Jul 19, 2021","On Saturday, former heavyweight boxing champion, Mike Tyson, asked his 5.6 million followers on Twitter which crypto asset they prefer: bitcoin or ethereum. Tyson is no stranger to the world of crypto and just recently stepped into the realm of non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles.The former professional boxer, otherwise known as “Kid Dynamite” and “Iron Mike,” tweeted about bitcoin and ethereum on Saturday and asked his followers which crypto asset they preferred. Tyson is quite familiar with bitcoin and on July 25, 2015, he tweeted about a bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) that featured his image. He also shared a website called miketysonbitcoin.com which is now offline. At the time, Tyson connected with a firm called Bitcoin Direct LLC but the venture was quickly forgotten after some drama.In more recent times, Tyson has teamed up with the full-service creative agency, NFT studio 1ofone. According to the announcement, Tyson will drop his first official NFT collection with 1ofone this August and it will be available via opensea.io. The former heavyweight champion collaborated with digital artist Cory Van Lew and the NFT collection will present “iconic moments from his career,” unlockable content, and a limited release as well.“The more I learn about NFT’s the more excited I am to be a part of the crypto/tech community,” Tyson said in a statement about the NFT project. “It’s the future and I chose to partner with 1ofone to help me navigate through the NFT community with something truly innovative and creative that tells a story about who I am.”Tyson’s tweet on Saturday not only got attention from a great number of crypto supporters but also legendary rapper Busta Rhymes. Rhymes has been intrigued by cryptocurrencies as well recently and tweeted about his curiosity to his Twitter followers. After Tyson asked: “Which do you prefer, BTC or ETH?” Rhymes replied and said: “Mike, I’m right there with you. Spent the last 30 min reading the comment section.”In the comment section of Tyson’s tweet, there’s a myriad of responses from the crowd. Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor responded and said: “Mike, I spent more than a thousand hours considering this question and chose bitcoin. So far, I have purchased $2.9 billion in BTC because I think it’s the future of digital property.” Even Twitter’s Jack Dorsey replied to Tyson and shared a website called hellobitco.in.Of course, a number of people shilled other crypto assets and a wide variety of cryptocurrencies are mentioned in Tyson’s thread. The official Baby Doge Coin Twitter account said: “Mike let’s talk #BabyDoge” with a boxing glove and dog emoji. Paxful executive Ray Youssef also responded to Tyson’s question. “Great to have you with us Mike,” Youssef remarked. “Bitcoin is halal and peaceful, honest money.”Youssef further added:[Ethereum] is a platform for defi which is permissionless protobanking. Both have their place but I hold most in bitcoin and the people of Africa are using it everyday as a way out of economic apartheid.Others simply implied that Tyson didn’t have to choose if he owned both crypto assets. Of course, the Tyson tweet also led to a number of bitcoin fans and ether supporters battling. Most of which stemmed from the bitcoin maximalist crowd, while other crypto asset fans claimed there are superior coins Tyson didn’t mention.Another individual said: “ETH is an entire decentralized secure economy. BTC is [a] decentralized secure orange coin. So I prefer ETH.” The number of replies to Tyson’s question is very large and like Busta Rhymes said, one could easily spend thirty minutes reading them.What do you think about Mike Tyson’s recent tweet about bitcoin and ethereum?

658,Paraguayan Lawmakers Present a Very Different 'Bitcoin Bill' Than Expected,"Jul 19, 2021","A group of Paraguayan lawmakers presented a ‘Bitcoin bill’ in the National Congress last week, but it turned out to be a very different proposal than what crypto followers expected. The bill seeks to control and regulate cryptocurrency transactions and establish taxes. There is no mention of declaring bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies as legal tender anywhere in the proposal.The long-hyped ‘Bitcoin bill’ was at last presented in Paraguay to the National Congress by two lawmakers last week, but it was not what some had anticipated. The project presented by deputy Carlos Rejala and the liberal senator Fernando Silva Facetti doesn’t aim to declare bitcoin as legal tender, as El Salvador did last month. In fact, it states the opposite. An early draft states:“Digital assets are not legal tender currencies used by the Paraguayan State, and for this reason they are not backed by the Central Bank of Paraguay”Instead, the proposed law seeks to regulate crypto transactions for the state to collect taxes for trading and other use cases. The law proposes the Central Bank of Paraguay as the comptroller of all the entities related to cryptocurrencies. Facetti, when consulted about the direction of the proposed law, stated:This is not a legal tender, this is a commodity and the purpose of the law is to regulate and control this industry. That is the base project that we really have today.The law also mentions bitcoin mining and trading as activities under its scope. Mining-related imports will be taxed with 5% corresponding to an aggregated value tax if the project gets approved. Also, cryptocurrency traders will have to be licensed annually and to-be-created state institutions will carry a record of these. The project states:“Any person whose main activity is that of trader must have an authorization issued by a competent authority, which enables him to carry out consultancies or transactions through a mandate or administration contract.The law describes sanctions for not complying with these mandates, but it doesn’t specify the forms these sanctions would take. If approved, the law would give a period for miners to register with the government and get operational licenses. To conclude, the law mentions the creation of the Digital Securities Fluctuation Reserve Fund, which would aid traders that lose digital assets in the market.What do you think about the newly proposed Paraguayan “bitcoin bill”?

659,"Crypto Experts Predict Bitcoin Price Rising to $318,417 by December 2025","Jul 18, 2021","A panel of crypto experts has predicted that the price of bitcoin will rise to $318,417 by December 2025. The most bullish expert believes that the price of the cryptocurrency will reach $160,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, 54% of them think that hyperbitcoinization will happen by 2050.Finder, a major product comparison website, has conducted a study to find out the future outlook of bitcoin as its popularity grows. “As awareness of cryptocurrencies continues to spread, all eyes are on bitcoin’s price. So we asked our panel of 42 cryptocurrency experts what’s in store for the coin,” the company detailed last week.The panelists include crypto asset managers, executives of crypto exchanges and other service providers, crypto analysts, professors, and lecturers at universities. Among various topics discussed was what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of the year and a few years from now. Finder detailed:While there may be some medium term price depreciation, the panel predicts that by December 2025, the price of BTC will go up to $318,417.The company added, “This is 61% higher than the panel’s end-of-2025 prediction in December 2020, but 12% lower than that in April.”Furthermore, the “Panelists predict that by December 2030, the price of bitcoin will go up to a whopping $4,287,591 per BTC. However, the average is skewed by outliers – when we look at the median price prediction, the 2030 price forecast comes down to $470,000,” Finder wrote.As for what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of the year, the majority of panelists (61%) said bitcoin is currently undervalued and on average the panel expected the price of the cryptocurrency at the end of 2021 to reach $66,284 per coin.Morpher CEO Martin Fröhler was the most bullish about the price of bitcoin on the panel. With a year-end prediction of $160,000 per BTC, he opined:Adoption by corporations and institutional investors paired with a loose monetary policy and high asset inflation will propel bitcoin to 6 figures before the end of this year. The next halving cycle will see increased adoption of bitcoin as a legal tender by developing countries, and until 2030, bitcoin will have replaced gold as a global reserve asset.Wave Financial senior trader Justin Chuh gave a lower-than-average price prediction of $56,000 for the year end. Nonetheless, he expressed confidence in bitcoin as the “tried-and-true safe haven” of digital assets. The trader sees the price of bitcoin on an upward trend, predicting that BTC will end 2025 at $210,000 and 2030 at $400,000, with halving events and inflation pushing the price upward. He said:Halving events and inflation along the way to 2025 and 2030 will likely trigger the larger upside moves. Prices are likely to be continuously driven by supply and demand, less availability for a wider group of users.However, not everyone on the panel was as bullish. University of Canberra’s senior lecturer, John Hawkins, was among the most bearish on the panel. His year-end prediction was $20,000 per bitcoin. The lecturer also believes that countries adopting bitcoin will actually have a negative impact on its price.The study also covers when the experts think hyperbitcoinization will happen. Finder found:54% of the panel thinks hyperbitcoinization – the moment that bitcoin overtakes global finance – will happen by 2050. 29% think it will happen as soon as 2035 and an additional 20% by 2040.The panel includes representatives from Galia Digital, Allnodes, Wave Financial, Morpher, Cryptocompare, Coinsmart, Banz Capital, Arcane Crypto, Rouge International and Rouge Ventures, Celsius Network, Coingecko, Coinflip, Token Metrics, Thomson Reuters, Finder, Morgan Creek Digital, Zebpay, Amber, Decred, UCL, the University of New South Wales, City University of Hong Kong, and the University of Western Australia.What do you think the price of bitcoin will be in 2025 and when do you think hyperbitcoinization will happen?

661,"Jackson, Tennessee Mayor Praises Bitcoin's Benefits Against Inflation, Aims to Create a BTC Hub","Jul 18, 2021","Jackson, Tennessee’s mayor is a fan of bitcoin and he wants the city to become a bitcoin hub in order to entice technology companies and innovation. Jackson’s mayor Scott Conger is in the midst of discussing creating legislation that allows Jackson residents to pay property taxes with bitcoin. Miami mayor Francis Suarez is not the only bitcoiner trying to get bitcoin companies and technological innovation to reside in his city. Jackson, Tennessee’s mayor is also a bitcoin fan and Scott Conger is the third member of his family to be Jackson’s mayor.Conger has noticed inflation creeping higher after the federal government and central bank created massive quantities of stimulus during the last year and a half. In Conger’s opinion bitcoin is the only solution to this problem. Three days ago Conger tweeted:Why do we accept inflation? Why don’t we demand more from our federal government 6.3% in 2 years? 172.8% in my lifetime. Every year our dollar is worth less. There is no rebound. There is only 1 fix for this… Bitcoin.In a recent interview, Conger said he’s been keeping an eye on Mayor Suarez of Miami and he believes bitcoin can benefit Jackson. Bitcoin is ideal for remote workers leveraging the city of Jackson and it could give the Tennessee city an edge. In another interview, Conger mentioned inflation again and started looking at things priced in satoshis (the smallest denomination of bitcoin).“It really hit home once it was pointed out the price of lumber in dollars… massive inflation vs the price in [satoshis],” Conger detailed. Conger is also known for saying:Let us not accept any inflation as well as the increasing carbon footprint.Conger has also initiated a task force dedicated to studying blockchain benefits and how payments with bitcoin can help bolster Jackson. “Our blockchain task force is looking into how the city of Jackson TN can accept property tax payments in bitcoin and allow our employees to DCA in bitcoin,” Conger tweeted on Thursday.Earlier this year, Eric Adams also joins Conger and Suarez as the New York City (NYC) mayoral candidate wants New York to be a bitcoin hub as well and “the center of all technology.” Prior to Eric Adams, another NYC mayoral candidate, Andrew Yang, also promoted bitcoin during his campaigning in February. As far as Jackson, Tennessee, and Conger, he’s following the footsteps of Suarez.“I’m taking pointers from Francis Suarez,” Conger tweeted. “In the coming weeks I will be forming a Blockchain Task Force to explore how to best position the city of Jackson TN for the future,” the mayor of Jackson added.What do you think about the mayor of Jackson, Tennessee promoting bitcoin for his city?

662,Analyst: 'Bitcoin Correction Very Similar to 2013 — BTC May Remain Stuck at $30K for a While',"Jul 18, 2021","The analytics provider Ecoinometrics has published a tweetstorm that shows the current downward spiral from bitcoin’s all-time high is one of “the longest drawdowns bitcoin has had to deal with during a post-halving bull market.” Furthermore, the same day, analyst and economist, Julio Moreno, highlighted in a recent blog post that “in bitcoin, volatility is your friend.”Most people in the industry understand that bitcoin (BTC) prices have seen better days and many spectators are wondering when the crypto asset will rebound. The fact of the matter is, we really don’t know, but people do leverage previous chart patterns from prior bull markets and have measured a number of timespans.In recent times, Bitcoin.com News has published at least two market reports that show speculators believe this bull run resembles the action that took place in 2013. According to the analytics provider Ecoinometrics, the current downturn is the second-longest drop since 2013 and there could be a lot more time left on the clock.“Bitcoin after the Halving [on] Jul. 17, 2021,” Ecoinometrics tweeted. “431 days after the 3rd halving [and] BTC at $31,678. One more week stuck in this drawdown, 95 days since the last ATH, bottom -55% below the ATH, and volatility continues to decline,” the analyst added. Ecoinometrics further stressed:This is one of the longest drawdowns bitcoin has had to deal with during a post-halving bull market. But 95 days is still only half the duration of the big drawdown of 2013… In terms of price trajectory, this correction also looks very similar to 2013. If we continue like that, BTC will remain stuck around $30k for a while.The analyst also added that bitcoin’s one-month volatility was also down but “historically speaking, it isn’t particularly low.”“So from that perspective it is possible for the trading range to stay pretty tight for longer,” Ecoinometrics concluded.Analyst and economist Julio Moreno agreed with Ecoinometrics’ volatility assessment, and shared a recent blog post he wrote about bitcoin volatility. Moreno’s report explains how people try to discredit bitcoin over price volatility, and his study asks whether or not “volatility [is] a bad thing.”The analyst notes in his report that he doesn’t believe volatility is necessarily a bad thing. “I would say it is not, as it increases within each cycle along with price gains. When is bitcoin’s price more volatile? Mostly at market tops, after significant price appreciation,” Moreno’s report emphasized. His bitcoin volatility report concludes:What does changes in bitcoin’s price volatility imply about its future trend? Accumulation has been better at low levels of volatility and this is typically reached before a big price movement.What do you think about the assessments from Ecoinometrics and Julio Moreno’s reports? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

663,"Billionaire Fund Manager Jeffrey Gundlach Convinced Bitcoin Will Fall Below $23K, US Dollar Is 'Doomed'","Jul 17, 2021","Doubleline Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach, also known as the “Bond King,” has predicted that the price of bitcoin will fall below the $23K level. “Right now, the chart on bitcoin looks pretty scary,” he said, adding that “it looks like a massive head-and-shoulders top.”Billionaire fund manager Jeff Gundlach talked about his outlook for bitcoin and the U.S. dollar in an interview with CNBC Thursday.Gundlach is the CEO of Doubleline Capital, which had over $135 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of March 31. He is sometimes referred to as the “Bond King” after he appeared on the cover of Barron’s in 2011 as “The New Bond King.” Institutional Investor named him “Money Manager of the Year” in 2013 and Bloomberg Markets named him one of “The Fifty Most Influential” in 2012, 2015, and 2016. According to Forbes, Gundlach’s net worth is currently $2.2 billion.He said: “Right now, the chart on bitcoin looks pretty scary. It’s dropped a lot from $60,000 down to around $31,500, and it looks like a massive head-and-shoulders top.” At the time of writing, the price of BTC stood at $31,616, based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. The Doubleline CEO added:I’m not a big believer in head-and-shoulders tops, but this one looks pretty convincing. Turning neutral at $23,000 was obviously too early, but I’ve got a feeling you’re going to be able to buy it below $23,000 again.Gundlach also commented on other investments. “Interestingly, gold is actually negative this year. Commodities are very strong. Commodities are up more than stocks this year as a basket. But gold can’t seem to get out of its own way. And obviously, the dollar being firmer lately is not positive for gold either,” he opined.Moreover, the billionaire fund manager said that “The dollar has been moderately firmer in the last several weeks, and that will continue,” elaborating:In the near term, the dollar seems firm. In the longer term, the dollar is doomed.The Bond King believes that a significant drop in the dollar is coming in the intermediate term, citing the size of the U.S. deficit.Gundlach said in November last year that bitcoin and gold were good as hedges against inflation. Furthermore, he predicted that within 18 months, the stock market was “going to crack pretty hard,” stating, “When the next big meltdown happens, I think the U.S. is going to be the worst-performing market, actually, and that’ll have a lot to do with the dollar weakening.”What do you think about Jeffrey Gundlach’s prediction?

664,Busking for Bitcoin: Report Finds Street Performers Depend on Digital Payments,"Jul 17, 2021","Street performers, or buskers, are leaning more toward digital platforms these days compared to the old method of accepting loose change. A report recently published by economists at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia has found that in certain areas, buskers get more donations via digital payment methods like Paypal and bitcoin from people passing by, than by traditional means.Economists at RMIT University in Melbourne and data collected from The Busking Project indicate that digital methods of payment are becoming the norm for street performers. According to statistics from the study, the research combed through the payments stemming from 3,500 buskers from 121 countries.Street performers getting payments via digital avenues have been leveraging different methods for quite some time. A myriad of stories and forum posts show bitcoiners have been busking for bitcoin throughout the last ten years.In April 2018, ABC interviewed a busker named Josh Thompson who was “busking for bitcoin.”At the time, Thompson said in Australia people passing by were “hesitant to make electronic payments to buskers.” However, Thompson remarked that it wasn’t the case everywhere, as other regions were more receptive to paying by digital means than loose change.“In Europe and the UK, with apps and Paypal and everyone getting into bitcoin, people actually are paying buskers with digital currency,” Thompson said.The most recent study compiled by RMIT economists was led by Dr. Meg Elkins, a senior lecturer in the School of Economics, Finance, and Marketing at RMIT. Elkins detailed that the report’s findings suggest street artists have more of an “entrepreneurial” spirit these days.“Buskers performing in public for coin is a centuries-old practice, but they have to move online as our society becomes increasingly cashless,” Elkins said. The economist further added:We know many street performers become personalities in their own right and we wanted to uncover how they could use digital payment systems to increase their online earnings and create more sustainable careers.The Busking Project itself is an application that street performers and fans use to connect. The platform enables tipping from bank transfers in a few different fiat currencies. However, a few of The Busking Project’s blog posts highlight the use of bitcoin for payments as well.In one particular article, The Busking Project gives the reader six digital methods to choose from and one of them is bitcoin. In the bitcoin section of the post, the author says the digital currency is: “My absolute favorite way to get tipped.”The author of the post, written in 2017, further highlights that bitcoin (BTC) “transaction fees are getting higher” and “it’s in the early adoption phase.” The author adds that bitcoin is well worth learning about and BTC’s value could rise over time.“So, if you get paid with bitcoin and keep it in your bitcoin wallet, you could end up making more than the tip amount,” the author of the six digital payments article adds.The RMIT economist believes digital payments and QR codes are an excellent way for buskers to get paid. RMIT’s study also shows circus acts obtained the largest donations. The probability of musicians getting donations is the highest, but musicians get the smallest payments as well.“In the future, we could see QR codes as part of the street performance, which would simplify the payment process even further,” Elkins remarked. The RMIT report’s author concluded:More than 40 QR code trails are underway across Europe, the US and Australia. Digital platforms can potentially allow street performers to generate more generous donations beyond cash tips.What do you think about buskers getting more in digital tips than by the traditional spare change method? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

665,Youtube Superstar KSI 'JJ' Says He Made Then Lost Millions Investing in Bitcoin,"Jul 17, 2021","Youtube superstar and rapper KSI, also known as JJ, has shared that he made millions of pounds investing in bitcoin and “lost it all” when the market “crashed.” Nonetheless, he still believes that bitcoin is the future and “eventually you’re going to get a $100,000 bitcoin, a $500,000 bitcoin, and a $1 million bitcoin. It’s going to happen.”Famed rapper and popular Youtuber KSI shared his experience investing in bitcoin on the Private Parts podcast, published Thursday.KSI, whose real name is Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji, is also known as JJ. In 2019, he was ranked second by The Sunday Times in its list of the top 100 U.K. influencers. He is also part of the British Youtube group known as the Sidemen. The British influencer recently became a vocal fan of cryptocurrency.He was asked about a rumor of him putting “a lot” of money into bitcoin. KSI then revealed that he invested £2 million ($2.75 million) in BTC around November or December last year but later lost money when the bitcoin market crashed. He said:Yeah, I put £2 million into bitcoin. Well, I said bitcoin … [But] This was in cryptocurrencies. I made £7 million, and now I’ve lost it all.“I got lucky with the £7 million, but I should have been smart and taken that money out into fiat and then just wait for everything to drop and go back into it again,” he opined, admitting that he got carried away with the bull market.KSI added: “It’s been a full journey, but I had to experience it. I had to really delve into the whole crypto space, and you know, I fully understand that now. I put money in things where I essentially leveraged myself and I kind of over-leveraged myself to a point where I lost money, because I got liquidated, so I put a lot of money into something I got liquidated because of the bitcoin crash.”Commenting on losing millions of dollars investing in cryptocurrencies, the Youtube star said, “I was like, ok, well big whoop,” elaborating:It is what it is. I’ll move on. There’s no point crying over spilt milk, and I realized that during the bear market is when you want to invest in things.He was also asked whether investing in bitcoin was like gambling. He replied: “No, I don’t think it is. I don’t think it is gambling. It’s not gambling. No, no, no, no. Bitcoin is here to stay. It is the future. It’s just that no one wants to accept it … Same with Ethereum. Yes, of course, it all fluctuates, but it’s going up.”KSI elaborated:If you stand back and look at the whole picture, it’s slowly going up and eventually you’re going to get a $100,000 bitcoin, a $500,000 bitcoin, and a $1 million bitcoin. It’s going to happen.The famed rapper further opined: “Maybe it might take 5, 10, 15, 20 years, but it’s going to happen, you’ve got to remember, bitcoin doesn’t have inflation … That’s what’s so great about it, it’s not controlled by a centralized bank.”What do you think about KSI’s experience investing in bitcoin?

666,4 Consecutive Difficulty Drops Make Bitcoin Block Rewards 54% Easier to Find,"Jul 16, 2021","Following the largest mining difficulty drop in Bitcoin’s history, this weekend will once again see another slide, but less than 5% of the difficulty will be shaved. Statistics show Bitcoin’s hashrate has been able to climb higher since the difficulty drop two weeks ago, and climbed above 100 exahash per second (EH/s) this week. This weekend’s upcoming bitcoin mining difficulty drop will be the only time in history the difficulty slipped four times in a row. After China cracked down on bitcoin miners at the end of June, a large quantity of hashpower had temporarily halted. Statistics indicate that the hashrate was around 66 EH/s on June 28 and since then it has increased to above the 100 EH/s zone.There’s currently 18 known mining pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain, and 4.71 % of the global hashrate (24-hour stats) or 4.79 EH/s belongs to unknown miners.Two weeks ago the Bitcoin network saw the largest difficulty drop ever and another difficulty drop is expected this weekend. Using today’s average hashrate, statistics show the drop will be less than 6% bringing the current difficulty of 14.36 trillion down to 13.5 trillion.This means after the dip, the mining difficulty will have dropped four times in a row. The last time the BTC mining difficulty dropped more than four times in a row was in 2011. From August to November 2011, the mining difficulty dropped eight times in a row.The only other time BTC’s mining difficulty came close to the four times in a row record was in 2018 for three consecutive difficulty drops between November and December.The most recent number of difficulty drops will see 54% shaved off the difficulty, which is slightly higher than the 51.54% shed in 2011. This means 2021’s consecutive downward difficulty adjustments were the greatest so far. Back then, the difficulty tapped a high of 1.89 million in August and by November it was 1.09 million at block height 155,232.At the time of writing, the top mining pools on Friday afternoon include Viabtc, Antpool, Poolin, F2pool, and Btc.com. These pools are followed by Binance, Foundry and Slushpool, but the top five operations command 59.4% of the global hashrate.Binance, Foundry and Slushpool capture 21.9% of BTC’s hashpower on Friday afternoon. That leaves ten known pools and 4.79 EH/s of unknown hashpower, commanding 18.7% of the global hashrate.What do you think about the four difficulty drops in 2021 compared to the eight drops in 2011? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

667,Former US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Says His View on Bitcoin 'Has Evolved',"Jul 15, 2021","Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says his viewpoint on bitcoin “has evolved a little bit.” While he personally does not want to have bitcoin in his portfolio, he says if people want to buy the cryptocurrency, “that’s perfectly fine.”Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked about bitcoin, cybersecurity, and the U.S. economy in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. He was asked whether his viewpoint on bitcoin has evolved since the last time he was interviewed by the media outlet when he was still the treasury secretary. At that time, Mnuchin was dismissive of the cryptocurrency, stating that it had no inherent value.Since then, a growing number of major companies and prominent traders have gotten into bitcoin. Major investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup, have either started offering or are in the process of offering crypto products or services to their clients.Regarding whether his viewpoint on bitcoin has evolved, Mnuchin said:I think my view has evolved a little bit, but it is pretty consistent … If people want to buy bitcoin as a substitute, no different than buying gold or some other asset, it’s fine. I don’t personally want to have it in my portfolio but if people want to that’s perfectly fine.The former treasury secretary added that “The underlying technology of blockchain is pretty incredible,” noting that there are many applications utilizing it.As for bitcoin and other crypto assets, Mnuchin emphasized that it is important for them to be regulatory-compliant, including complying with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).Noting that under the Trump administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) approved banks to offer cryptocurrency custodian services last year, he explained:The reason we did that was because we wanted to make sure that this was becoming in the regulated world … and it should be fully BSA compliant.What do you think about Mnuchin’s comments on bitcoin?

668,"Financial Report Shows Bit Digital Is Transferring 14,500 Bitcoin Miners From China to the US","Jul 15, 2021","Following the bitcoin mining crackdown in China, the Nasdaq-listed firm Bit Digital published a second-quarter bitcoin production and mining operations update and noted the company is moving 14,500 bitcoin miners from China to the United States. Bit Digital says after the Chinese government’s decision to ban bitcoin mining, the company “accelerated” its migration strategy to North America.On July 13, the company Bit Digital (Nasdaq: BTBT) revealed that it was migrating 14,500 bitcoin miners to the U.S. after China’s recent crackdown. The migration information stems from its unaudited report which explains the firm’s bitcoin production and mining operations during Q2 2021.As of June 30, Bit Digital reported that it owned approximately 32,500 miners which produce roughly 1.92 exahash per second (EH/s) of hashpower. Bit Digital emphasized that during the first quarter, the company participated in fleet repositioning and sold specific older mining rig models, and made opportunities to buy newer machines.Bit Digital made a “small gain on miner sales” and expects to leverage $5.4 million in funds toward “newer vintage miners.” Utilizing the spot market during Q2, Bit Digital purchased 3,515 mining rigs and aims to buy more miners with additional capital.“The company earned 562.9 bitcoins in the second quarter of 2021,” Bit Digital wrote in the unaudited report. “The reduction from the first quarter was due to the accelerated migration program, in which more miners were offline while in transit to or awaiting installation in North America, as well as miner sales and disposals. Treasury holdings of bitcoin increased to 588.4,” Bit Digital’s finance report adds.At the end of the report, Bit Digital explains that it has been migrating miners to North America and has been since October 2020. “As a result, a greater proportion of the company’s fleet was offline than in the prior quarter, due to more miners being in transit to or awaiting installation in North America,” Bit Digital disclosed. The firm’s statement continued:During the quarter, the company shipped 14,500 miners to the United States. The company expects to complete the migration of its remaining China-based miners to North America early in the third quarter of 2021.The news follows the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) project’s recent update, which shows 46% of the Bitcoin hashrate resides in China. The estimate is much lower than 2020 statistics that had shown China captured roughly 65% of the network hashrate. The CBECI bitcoin mining map, however, only records data up until April 2021. Nevertheless, statistics clearly show, similar to Bit Digital saying it started migration plans in October 2020, many others seemingly did the same.What do you think about Bit Digital migrating 14,500 bitcoin miners from China to the U.S.?

669,University of Cambridge Bitcoin Mining Map Shows China's Hashrate Dropped to 46%,"Jul 15, 2021","After the researchers from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) project said that the website’s “Bitcoin Mining Map” had not been updated since April 2020, the map has finally been updated. Current data from the mining map shows the coverage goes all the way up until April 2021, and the estimate of China’s hashrate dominance is much lower than previous estimates. University of Cambridge data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) indicates that China has a lot less hashrate dominance than once thought. On June 19, Bitcoin.com News reported on how difficult it was to estimate how much hashrate is actually residing in China.While writing that specific report, the CBECI project explained on its website that the Bitcoin Mining Map had not been updated since April 2020. Furthermore, in December 2020, Bitcoin.com News was told at the time the “CBECI map hasn’t been updated for some time now” by a University of Cambridge researcher.Today, that has changed and the CBECI map has a lot more updated information at least up until April 2021. So this means the CBECI map won’t account for the mass migration of Chinese bitcoin miners that followed the month of April.However, the updated CBECI map does show China’s hashrate dominance in April was around 46%. That figure is a lot lower than the older estimate before the update which was 65%. The U.S. captures 16.8% and Kazakhstan follows behind America with 8.19%, according to CBECI’s “Evolution of country share” statistics.The University of Cambridge researchers leverage sample data from geolocational mining facilities and several bitcoin mining pools. Partners that help contribute to the CBECI map include Poolin, Viabtc, Btc.com, and Foundry.The CBECI map also highlights the “Evolution of Chinese provinces share” in another chart dedicated to these statistics. The dominance of Chinese provinces stem from areas like Sichuan (16.4%), Xinjiang (54.4%), Yunnan (8.7%), Nei Mongol (3.7%), Gansu (1.3%) Zhejiang (0.2%), Beijing (4.8%), Qinghai (2.3%), and unknown regions (8.1%).As far as other countries besides China, the U.S., and Kazakhstan, the CBECI map shows the Russian Federation has around 6.84% of the global hashrate. This is followed by unknown regions capturing 5.92%, Iran 4.64%, Malaysia 3.44%, Canada 3%, Germany 2.81%, and Ireland 2.27%.After not updating the data for quite some time, the CBECI research team notes that updates are now “scheduled on a monthly basis and are subject to data availability (generally with a delay of one to three months).”What do you think about the latest update on how much hashrate is located in China? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

670,New York Giants' Saquon Barkley Plans to Convert Endorsement Revenue to Bitcoin,"Jul 15, 2021","Another pro athlete in the National Football League (NFL) is planning to convert some of his earnings into bitcoin. The 24-year-old running back for the New York Giants, Saquon Barkley, discussed converting his endorsement revenue into bitcoin during a recent interview with the Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano.Saquon Barkley is taking his marketing money and transferring it into bitcoin (BTC) according to an interview he had with Anthony Pompliano on the show “The Best Business Show.” Barkley’s interview also featured the CEO of the company Strike, Jack Mallers, and the NFL running back said Mallers helped educate him on the technology. The football player said he will be directly depositing his marketing money into his Strike account in order to convert to BTC.It is estimated that Barkley makes around eight figures ($10 million) annually from his marketing endorsements. The NFL player has endorsement deals with Toyota, Pepsi, Campbell Soup Company, Nike, and Panini America, according to NJ.com data. Barkley told Pompliano that he studied how inflation was affecting the economy and that because of inflation’s negative effects on wealth accumulation, he’s moving toward bitcoin.“We’re seeing inflation and we’re learning you can’t save wealth. That’s why I am going to be taking my marketing money in bitcoin,” Barkley said on the show. “When you see the KDs, the Lebrons, and [Tom] Bradys of the world, and you want to create generational wealth, you can’t do that with the sport that I play…and coming off of injuries. When you sit out of football for a whole year, you realize that this game could be taken away from you,” the NFL running back stressed.Barkley is not the only NFL player who has converted funds into bitcoin (BTC) as the Carolina Panthers offensive lineman, Russell Okung, turned half of his salary into bitcoin. When BTC was nearing all-time highs it was estimated that Okung was the highest-paid player in the NFL. Other professional athletes are also looking into getting paid in cryptocurrencies as a myriad of announcements has been made this year.England’s Premier League soccer team, the Southampton Football Club, now has the option to get bonuses paid in BTC. The American professional stock car racing driver, Landon Cassill, told the public in June that for the remainder of the NASCAR season he was going to be paid in crypto.No. 1 NFL Draft Pick Trevor Lawrence claimed he converted his entire signing bonus to cryptocurrencies according to reports. The Kansas City Chiefs NFL player, Sean Culkin, also said he would convert all of his salary to bitcoin this year. The American professional basketball team, the Sacramento Kings, recently detailed it will offer everyone in its organization the option of having their salary paid in bitcoin.Saquon Barkley was named the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Year during his first season and he’s also been doing commercials for the multimedia streaming firm Hulu. Last year, Barkley and the Cleveland Browns’ Baker Mayfield appeared in a Hulu advertisement together.Barkley said he understands that an NFL career could be hurt by things he can’t control like an injury, and bitcoin can help his wealth avoid erosion from other circumstances he also cannot control like inflation.What do you think about Saquon Barkley taking his marketing money and turning it into bitcoin? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

671,Compass Mining Partners With Oklo to Power Bitcoin Mining Operations With Advanced Fission,"Jul 15, 2021","Bitcoin mining firm Compass Mining announced the company has entered a 20-year partnership with Oklo Inc., a California-based firm that produces clean, emission-free energy via advanced fission. Oklo explains the company is committed to providing 150 megawatts (MW) of clean power to Compass in order to drive bitcoin mining operations.In recent times, all types of renewable and sustainable energy sources have been applied to bitcoin mining processes as miners worldwide leverage excess flare gas, hydropower, solar energy, and geothermal solutions.Just recently, the Bitcoin Mining Council published a report that estimated around 56% of Bitcoin’s SHA256 hashrate was powered by clean energy. In recent times, a great number of operations have also shifted to carbon-neutral methods of acquiring energy to mine bitcoin.On Wednesday, the bitcoin mining company Compass Mining announced that it is partnering with Oklo Inc. in order to acquire clean energy to fuel its operations. The announcement on Wednesday details that Oklo will provide 150MW of power to Compass for the first phase of the partnership.Oklo highlights that the firm’s advanced fission process can produce power for Compass for 20 years. Furthermore, there’s never a need to refuel with advanced fission processes and Oklo’s advanced fission powerhouses also leverage “capabilities to turn nuclear waste into clean energy.”Basically, advanced fission is a form of nuclear fission in which an atom’s nucleus is split into either two or many smaller nuclei. The process produces an output of neutrons and gamma photons which can be leveraged for all types of energy purposes.The fission of heavy elements was first discovered in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. Fission does not depend on fossil fuels but the elements needed to create advanced fission processes are hard to find since elements like uranium and plutonium are used. People have also taken issue with the toxic waste left behind as it’s an extremely difficult waste product to dispose of.Oklo’s advanced fission method uses a different approach and doesn’t utilize moderators like water to slow neutrons. Oklo foregoes this process as doing so allows neutrons to move much faster through the use of a smaller facility. The company also deploys a refined form of the uranium-235 isotope compared to the traditionally used uranium-238.By using uranium-235, Oklo’s reactor can run substantially longer than traditional nuclear fission sites that need to refuel more often. Jacob DeWitte, the cofounder and CEO of Oklo, detailed on Wednesday that the company looks forward to working with Compass Mining.“We are proud to blaze new trails on the commercialization of our powerhouses by partnering with Compass in decarbonizing Bitcoin,” DeWitte said in a statement. “Cryptocurrency mining offers promising pathways to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, and Oklo is positioned to respond to commercial demands by offering end-users the convenience of buying clean, reliable, and cost-effective power that they can depend on,” the Oklo executive added.Whit Gibbs, the cofounder and CEO of Compass, believes that partnering with Oklo will help “redefine the energy landscape for cryptocurrency mining.” Earlier this year, Oklo also became the first company in its sector to get an application accepted by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to construct and operate an advanced fission plant.“Compass is thrilled to partner with a cutting-edge team like Oklo,” Gibbs added. “Together we can push the Bitcoin mining industry forward into a new phase of cheap and reliable power from advanced fission. Every bitcoin miner understands the need for cheap, reliable power.”What do you think about the partnership between Oklo and Compass Mining? What do you think about bitcoin miners leveraging advanced fission processes? Let us know in the comments section below.

672,"Poland, Romania Rank in Top 10 for Number of Bitcoin ATMs, World’s Total Exceeds 23,000","Jul 15, 2021","Two East European nations, Poland and Romania, are now among the top 10 countries hosting the most cryptocurrency ATMs. The global number of teller machines supporting crypto transactions has increased exponentially over the past months, now reaching over 23,000 devices. The growth in popularity and market prices of cryptocurrencies in the past year has led to a spike in the number of locations around the world offering crypto holders automated teller services. Most Bitcoin ATMs let you buy coins with cash and cards, while some devices facilitate two-way transactions allowing users to also sell cryptos. Major currencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and bitcoin cash (BCH) are typically supported.Quoting data compiled by Crypto Head, the Warsaw Business Journal recently wrote that Poland has entered the top 10 nations having the highest number of cryptocurrency ATMs. According to this ranking, the country is seventh with 112 crypto teller devices, placing behind Hong Kong and ahead of Switzerland.The United States tops the chart. The U.S. has a rapidly growing network of Bitcoin ATMs (BATMs) that has exceeded 17,000 machines supporting deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrency across the country. Its northern neighbor, Canada, ranks second with almost 1,500 ATMs, followed by the U.K. with around 200, the report details.According to Coin ATM Radar, the global number of locations with cryptocurrency ATMs and tellers has reached 23,386 as of July. Its data covers 74 countries and more than 600 operators. The tracking website has its own ranking, according to which Poland is eighth with 83 locations.Poland is followed by another East European nation, Romania, which already has 78 ATMs and teller machines exchanging fiat and crypto. The U.S., Canada, and the U.K. are again the three leading BATM destinations with 20,603, 1,618, and 194 locations respectively.The Warsaw Business Journal remarks that the growing network of crypto ATMs has sparked concerns among authorities about whether they might be used for illicit purposes. The report provides examples such as the moving of large amounts of money across the U.S. and Mexico border during the coronavirus pandemic and a discussion in Vancouver on a possible ban on coin ATMs allegedly used for money laundering.According to Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), no provisions in the Polish legislation currently ban or restrict Bitcoin ATMs in any way. However, the companies that install and operate devices buying and selling cryptocurrencies are subject to the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, the Polish publication notes.What are your thoughts on the growing number of cryptocurrency ATMs around the world? Tell us in the comments section below.

The most crowded trade is now “long tech stocks,” followed by “long ESG.”Bank of America’s global fund manager survey for July, published Tuesday, shows that “long bitcoin” has fallen to third place among the most crowded trades. The Global Fund Manager Survey is Bank of America Securities’ monthly report that canvasses the views of approximately 200 institutional, mutual, and hedge fund managers around the world.The most crowded trade is now “long tech stocks,” followed by “long ESG,” and “long bitcoin.” “Long commodities” has fallen to fourth place from being the most crowded trade last month.The surveyed fund managers in July were much less bullish over growth, earnings, and inflation compared to earlier in the year, Bank of America’s survey shows. Overall, 74% of fund managers still expect growth and inflation to be “above trend.”“Long bitcoin” was the most crowded trade in May when “long tech stocks” came second, followed by “long ESG.” In June, “long commodities” overtook “long bitcoin” as the most crowded trade, leaving the cryptocurrency trade in second place. “Long tech stocks” ranked third and “long ESG” fourth at the time.Meanwhile, Bank of America has established a cryptocurrency research team, according to the bank’s internal memo. “We are uniquely positioned to provide thought leadership due to our strong industry research analysis, market-leading global payments platform, and our blockchain expertise,” the bank said last week. Bank of America also recently released a report stating that digital currency “could boost economic growth” in developing countries.What do you think about tech stocks and ESG overtaking bitcoin as the most crowded trades in the new Bank of America survey?

676,Self-Proclaimed Bitcoin Inventor Jörg Molt Arrested for Alleged Crypto Pension Fraud,"Jul 14, 2021","In 2019, a man with Fabio-like hair entered the cryptocurrency scene with questionable claims when he told a slew of people he helped co-found the creation of Bitcoin. The self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor named Jörg Molt not only offered a “Satoshi School” but allegedly ran a number of scams on the side. The publication Bild reports the 48-year-old man was arrested by Bavarian police at Frankfurt Airport over accusations of fraud.Jörg Molt once claimed he helped invent Bitcoin and also said he was good pals with ​​Andreas Antonopoulos after a wild appearance at the 2019 WCC Vegas Blockchain Week conference. Molt allegedly went around the conference in Las Vegas claiming to be the co-inventor of Bitcoin. After the story went viral, Antonopoulos discredited his claims and stressed that he didn’t know Molt at all.“Apparently, a German person called ‘Jörg Molt’ has been showing a selfie taken with me and telling people that we are friends — This is a LIE,” Antonopoulos tweeted at the time. “I don’t know him at all — I have heard from others that he claims to be the founder of Bitcoin and has thousands of BTC — A LIE.”The regional publication the Bild reports that Molt was recently arrested just as he was about to board a plane at Frankfurt Airport. Law enforcement officials believe Molt has been behind some scams also involving a 54-year-old woman who was allegedly his companion. The Bavarian police also searched Molt’s home and found evidence tied to the investigation.Molt is being charged with defrauding 50 people for $2.14 million with a scheme dubbed the “Bitcoin Pension” project. Molt, who is also a well-known DJ in Germany, reportedly told investors that the funds he obtained would go to BTC miners in Sweden. 40% of the funds were allegedly kept in a safe account but in 2020, Bitcoin Pension stopped operations and investors called it a scam.Investigators claim the self-proclaimed Satoshi did not invest the funds into mining and he’s being charged for his promises of big returns. Back in 2019, during the WCC Vegas Blockchain Week event, Molt told people he held more than 250,000 bitcoin. However, despite Molt’s claims, his ex-wife filmed a Youtube video claiming Molt didn’t even own a computer in 2008 when the Bitcoin network launched.What do you think about Jörg Molt getting arrested in Germany?

678,Whale From 2012 Transfers 740 Bitcoin Worth $26M After BTC Sat Idle for 9 Years,"Jul 13, 2021","On July 12, an old whale from 2012 spent 740 bitcoin worth roughly $26 million at the time of transfer after nine years of choosing not to move the coins. The whale acquired the bitcoin on May 31, 2012, when the stash of crypto was only worth $3,700.Bitcoiners noticed a whale move 740 bitcoin (BTC) on Monday after the coins sat idle for over nine years. The bitcoin sat for approximately 3,330 days as the BTC was acquired on May 31, 2012. The address saw life in the spring of 2012 and the wallet has been stacking small increments of BTC since the first large deposit of 740 BTC nine years ago.At the time of acquisition, bitcoin (BTC) was trading for $5 per coin so the 740 BTC was worth $3,700. Today, however, the stash was worth over $26 million when it transferred on Monday.The whale movement was caught by whale-alert.io that stated on Twitter that a “dormant address containing 791 BTC (26,147,621 USD) has just been activated after 9.1 years.” Roughly 640 BTC went to one address while 100 BTC went into another address according to blockchair.com’s transaction statistics.The transaction hash and details show that the transfer was sent with a low privacy score rating (45 out of 100) according to Blockchair’s Privacy-o-meter. After the transfer sent the bitcoins to two addresses, the coins were then siphoned into a tree of BTC addresses.Whale sightings are a favorite pastime for bitcoiners and there’s been a lot of big moves this year. For instance, on June 9, Bitcoin.com News reported on the “mystery whale” from 2010, which has moved over 10,000 BTC that sat idle for over a decade.Moreover, data shows that in the early days, a great number of people mined bitcoin alongside the crypto asset’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Last June, at block height 687,847 an old 2010 mining whale spent 100 BTC that sat idle for over ten years mined on July 15 and then the next day in 2010.What do you think about the 2012 whale that moved 740 bitcoin on Monday?

680,Bitcoinization: JPMorgan Sees No ‘Tangible Economic Benefits’ of Bitcoin as Legal Tender,"Jul 12, 2021","JPMorgan has offered its view on the bitcoinization of El Salvador, the country which recently made bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. JPMorgan says, “It is difficult to see any tangible economic benefits associated with adopting bitcoin as a second form of legal tender.”JPMorgan & Chase’s Latin American research team published a report titled “The Bitcoinization of El Salvador” Thursday. El Salvador recently passed legislation making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.The JPMorgan analysts who authored the report wrote:It is difficult to see any tangible economic benefits associated with adopting bitcoin as a second form of legal tender.The report also points out that “Recent surveys suggest widespread skepticism and hesitance of bitcoin as a medium of exchange … with extreme volatility posing a particularly acute challenge in a bimonetary system alongside official dollarization.”JPMorgan noted that bitcoin’s daily trading volumes often exceed $40 billion to $50 billion. However, a large portion of BTC is locked up in illiquid entities, with more than 90% not changing hands in more than a year, the analysts explained, adding:Only a small fraction of circulating supply mobile and available for use in everyday transactions; daily payment activity in El Salvador would represent -4% of recent on-chain transaction volume and more than 1% of the total value of tokens which have been transferred between wallets in the past year.The JPMorgan report further adds that the illiquidity and nature of the volume are “potentially a significant limitation on its potential as a medium of exchange.”However, many bitcoiners were quick to point out that the JPMorgan report does not mention the Lightning Network. Bitcoin advocate and Avanti Financial Group CEO Caitlin Long commented: “‘The Bitcoinization of El Salvador’ written by its Latam research team & it doesn’t mention Lightning Network even once. It’s clear they don’t even understand the basics.” Three major bitcoin wallets used in El Salvador utilize the Lightning Network: the government’s upcoming Chivo wallet, the Bitcoin Beach wallet, and Jack Mallers’ Strike app.The report continues: “A persistent imbalance on demand for BTC/USD conversions on the government platform (Chivo) could cannibalize onshore dollar liquidity and eventually introduce fiscal and balance of payments risk.”In addition, the JPMorgan team believes that adopting bitcoin as legal tender “may imperil negotiations with the IMF” for El Salvador, stating:We believe the Bitcoin Law is complicating talks around IMF aid which we continue to believe is necessary to put El Salvadorian debt on a more sustainable path.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of “a number of macroeconomic, financial, and legal issues” surrounding El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender.What do you think about JPMorgan’s view on the bitcoinization of El Salvador? Let us know in the comments section below.

681,"Incoming Squeeze? Bitcoin Shorts on Bitfinex Spike, BTC Long Positions Tap Fresh New Highs","Jul 12, 2021","The entire market capitalization of all 10,800 cryptocurrencies in existence is down 2.8% on Monday as bitcoin has lost over 2.4% during the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, bitcoin shorts are rising again after bitcoin shorts tapped a two-year high on the derivatives exchange Bitfinex on June 25.Bitcoin (BTC) and digital markets, in general, have seen better days as BTC tapped an all-time high above the $64K handle three months ago but is still down 48.66% since then. Roughly 17 days ago, on Bitfinex, the number of BTC/USD short positions skyrocketed to levels not seen since June 17, 2019.Around 20 days ago, BTC reached its lowest price point in quite some time at $28,600 per coin, and today the cryptocurrency is only 13.72% up from that low price point. Now after the June 25th spike in short positions, things settled on June 27 and shorts remained low. Today, however, short positions held on Bitfinex are starting to climb once again and some spectators believe it’s a bearish signal.At the time of writing, BTC/USD shorts recorded on the derivatives exchange Bitfinex have spiked at least halfway toward the high recorded on June 25. 13,600+ BTC/USD shorts have been recorded while BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex have surpassed 2019’s all-time highs.Over 51,100 long positions on the exchange have been played so far on Monday and both longs and shorts continue to climb. The number of long positions doesn’t necessarily give a bullish impression either, but it kind of shows some optimistic sentiment, one where market participants are hopeful about a rise in the future.The ethereum short position chart pattern is a bit different than bitcoin’s as shorts have risen in recent times but have also started dipping today. ETH/USD long positions also show a different path than BTC’s current long records on Bitfinex, as ETH/USD longs on the derivatives exchange is low on Monday.Etoro market analyst Simon Peters places a lot of the crypto market carnage blame on the digital currency mining issues in China and the regulatory climate worldwide.“Both crypto assets (BTC & ETH) have been hit by crypto crackdowns in China and regulatory changes in different jurisdictions around the world,” Peters said in a note to Bitcoin.com News on Monday.The number of BTC/USD shorts also may not be considered bearish, as a short squeeze could be in the cards. A “short squeeze” in BTC/USD markets is not unusual and when it happens, it triggers an extremely fast pump that leaves short sellers in the dust and in the land of liquidations. Usually short squeezes occur in the world of bitcoin trading when there’s an unusually high amount of BTC/USD short positions recorded.The same thing can happen to those playing longs in what’s called a “long squeeze.” Similarly, a significant and sudden dive in bitcoin’s value incites panic selling and longs are also forced to liquidate.What do you think about the current rise in short positions and the significant long positions at the moment? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

682,Nigeria's June P2P Bitcoin Trade Volumes Surged Again Despite Central Bank's Crypto Restrictions,"Jul 12, 2021","Nigeria’s peer-to-peer bitcoin trade volumes went up to just under $38 million in June 2021, the latest data shows. This surge becomes only the second time Nigerian P2P traded volumes have breached the $35 million mark in 2021. March 2021 is the only other period when P2P bitcoin traded volumes nearly surpassed the $38 million mark. Still, as the data shows, the country’s June volumes surge had been preceded by the marginal drop of traded value to $35.2 million and $34.9 million in the months of April and May 2021 respectively. Nevertheless, both volumes still remain higher than the over $31 million which was recorded in February 2021.Nevertheless, the latest data (which is sourced from two P2P exchanges) once again suggests that Nigerian interest and usage of cryptocurrencies continue to grow despite the imposition of restrictions on crypto assets by the central bank.In early February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directed financial institutions to stop serving entities involved in cryptocurrencies. The measures took immediate effect and this also led to the immediate decline in the traded volumes of centralized exchanges. On the other hand, the growth in P2P volumes appears to show that traders have switched to platforms which the CBN cannot control or censor.The same data shows that second-ranked Kenya’s June traded volumes dropped to $13.4 million from the $16.5 million that was recorded in May. However, this drop represents the first time the country’s upwards volumes growth trend has been shattered so far this year.Meanwhile, the latest data shows that Ghana has now replaced South Africa as the country with the third-highest P2P bitcoin trades after its volumes topped $11.2 million in June. With traded volumes of $7.7 million, South Africa is now ranked fourth on the continent. The Central Africa Republic, which recorded volumes of less than $50,000 in June 2019, is in fifth place after trades worth $1.85 million were recorded in June 2021.What are your thoughts on the latest African P2P bitcoin traded volumes?

685,The Bogdanoff Twins Claim They Participated in Helping Satoshi Nakamoto Build Bitcoin,"Jul 11, 2021","Following the infamous meme that shows one of the Bogdanoff twins on the phone telling whales to initiate a crypto-market dump, the Bogdanoff brothers now claim they took part in inventing the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin with Satoshi Nakamoto. During an interview hosted on L’Heure des Pros, the Bogdanoff twins said as mathematicians the two were able to “participate in the elaboration of some of the source code.”There’s been a long-running joke that the Bogdanoff twins have the power to manipulate crypto markets after a meme started a few years ago showing one of the twins ordering a substantial dump on the market.The meme has been seen by the twins, according to a recent interview on L’Heure des Pros and a recent appearance on the French television show “Non Stop People.” Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff said they have seen the meme, and explained that Satoshi Nakamoto probably has something to do with its online virality.“It is probably Nakamoto who made [the Grichka Bogdanoff meme] circulate,” Igor Bogdanoff said. Igor further added:[The image] was in all blockchains between 2010-2012 [and] downloaded more than 1.3 billion times.The Bogdanoff twins are well known for their science-based television show called “Time X.” Since the 1970s, the twins have been scientific essayists and while Igor has a doctorate in theoretical physics, his brother has a doctorate in mathematics.During the recent interview with the Bogdanoff twins, the two explained how they had worked with the touchscreen inventor François Mizzi and an interesting Japanese scientist dubbed “Soïtchiro Shimoda.”The twins claim that back in the early days, they would discuss blockchain and crypto asset ideas with Shimoda regularly. The Bogdanoffs wholeheartedly believe Shimoda was associated with the “mythical person or a group of people” who invented bitcoin. In fact, the Bogdanoff brothers further claim that two “ancient bitcoins” were bestowed upon the twins back in 2008.“Igor and I, as mathematicians, were able to participate in the elaboration of some of the [Bitcoin] source code, especially the ‘predictive code’,” Grichka Bogdanoff told his interviewer.During the interviews, the Bogdanoff twins further discussed the smart contract crypto network ethereum (ETH) as well. In the near future, the infamous twins who are well known in memes and conspiracies, said that they will be launching a new crypto asset called “Exo Coin.”What do you think about the Bogdanoff twins’ claims? Do you think they are telling the truth or attempting to gather attention? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

His declaration shortly followed one by fellow congressman, U.S. Representative Barry Moore, who declared that he had invested in dogecoin, ether, and cardano.A growing number of U.S. lawmakers are investing in cryptocurrencies or crypto-related investments. According to a Periodic Transaction Report filed on July 7, U.S. Senator Patrick Toomey from Pennsylvania declared two personal cryptocurrency investments, each worth between $1,000 and $15,000. One was in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the other in Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).The senator’s investments have decreased in value since his purchases. He invested in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) on June 15 when the price was around $33.23. At the time of writing, it has fallen to $27.65. As for his investment in Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the price was $24.45 on June 14 when bought it but has since dropped to $20.41 at the time of writing.Toomey has recently voiced concerns about crypto regulation. A few days before investing in Grayscale’s bitcoin and ethereum trusts, the senator wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the Treasury Department to “make significant revisions” to the crypto proposals by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). He believes that if the current proposals are adopted, “they would have a detrimental impact on financial technology (fintech), the fundamental privacy of Americans, and efforts to combat illicit activity.” He also raised concerns about FATF’s guidance.The lawmaker from Pennsylvania is not the only U.S. senator with a bitcoin-related investment. The outspoken pro-bitcoin U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming owns about five bitcoins. She encouraged “people to buy and hold” BTC. “I encourage them to save bitcoin for their retirement, for their future.”Recently, U.S. Representative Barry Moore from Alabama also declared his cryptocurrency investments. He bought dogecoin (DOGE), ether (ETH), and cardano (ADA).What do you think about Senator Pat Toomey investing in bitcoin and ether through Grayscale’s trusts?

687,Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin Price Model Criticized as BTC Price Ratio Matches 2019 Statistics,"Jul 10, 2021","During the last week, crypto enthusiasts and traders have been discussing the stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price model created by the pseudonymous crypto analyst “Plan B.” Despite Plan B’s worst and best case scenario calls on June 20, a touch over a week later the analyst said the “next 6 months will be make or break for S2F.” Currently, the S2F model has seemingly run off course and resembles the levels it saw in January 2019. There’s some skepticism toward Plan B’s infamous stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price model ever since the closing price in June recorded below the S2F’s projected course. The model’s creator, however, would not necessarily use the terms “off course” but “just touching lower bands.”Plan B recently explained his “worst case scenario for 2021,” where he predicts prices to end up being around “Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K.” However, on June 1, Plan B noted that the price was currently below the S2F trajectory.“June closing price $35,037 .. as far below S2F model as in Jan 2019. Next 6 months will be make or break for S2F (again),” Plan B said.Others assume that bitcoin is just not getting attention as the media is highlighting the gains made by shiba inu (SHIB), baby doge (BABYDOGE), and dogecoin (DOGE).“Hard to take bitcoin seriously when the mass media is spouting out articles about dogecoin and shiba inu. We are going to $10,000,” an individual responded to Plan B’s “make or break” tweet. Another individual replied to Plan B’s assessment with more optimism.“Even in the bear market of 2019 BTC tripled in a few months…… 100K is secured, [a] very low target in current bull market.” Plan B responded to the individuals “very low target” tweet and said:Indeed. And I must say [the] 2019 bear market (when I published S2F model btw) felt much much worse than [the] current ‘China ban’ dip.Others believe bitcoin (BTC) prices are a bargain right now and a chance of a lifetime purchasing opportunity. Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer at Moskovski Capital shared this type of assessment on Saturday.“Negative Stock-To-Flow deflection is the highest it’s ever been in the whole bitcoin history,” Moskovski said. “This is a great buying opportunity, if you’re a believer in this model.” Still, even after Moskovski’s positive sentiment, a few skeptics think that the bubble has burst.“I would like to believe any bullish Glassnode indicator, however, the increasingly overwhelming reality is that the bubble is bursting once again,” the person said in response to Moskovski’s tweet. “Retail is gone, many have probably again forgot that crypto even exists.”Another person asked Moskovski when Plan B would stop standing behind the price model. “I wonder what deflection it will take for Plan B to admit the model is nonsense,” the individual remarked.After a few reports that came out about Plan B’s S2F bitcoin price model, one article leveraged the term “off course.” The pseudonymous crypto analyst disagreed with the terminology that was used in a specific article’s headline.“Nah,” Plab B tweeted in response to the headline. “S2F model is not “off course” .. just touching lower bands (just like Jan 2019 and Mar 2020).”What do you think about Plan B’s price model touching lower bands and his recent “make or break” tweet?

The 35-year-old from the city of Newport in the U.K. has shared with The Sun publication his 12-month plan to search the city landfill using x-ray scanning devices and AI technology.Noting that “This would be a proper search – not just somebody going in with a bucket and spade,” the British man affirmed:We have a system with multiple conveyor-belts, x-ray scanning devices and an AI scanning device that would be trained to recognise items that are a similar size and density to the hard drive.“This would be a delicate search because we wouldn’t want to damage the hard drive in the process – you can’t just use a claw grabber,” he emphasized. “We’ve spoken to excavation experts and proper engineers to make sure it was all being done correctly as well as in a way that was safe for the environment.”Howells added that over the past four or five months, he had been “talking to some of the best data recovery experts in the world to make sure we can get it off the hard drive.”The search will be costly but Howell said that his plan is backed by a very rich hedge fund willing to cover the cost of the search and the equipment involved in exchange for the lion’s share of his fortune.Howells believes that his hard drive is in a 200-meter squared area and could be 15 meters deep based on aerial photographs of the site. The IT engineer said:We estimate there is between 300,000 – 400,000 tonnes of waste to look through.Despite having a plan, Howells said that the Newport City Council would not let him search the landfill, even after he offered them £55 million ($76 million).The Newport City Council explained that “The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds – without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order.” Moreover, the council stated that “excavation is not possible under our licensing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area.”At the time of writing, 7,500 bitcoins are worth about $246 million according to data from Bitcoin.com Markets.Do you think James Howells will recover his bitcoins? Let us know in the comments section below.

689,Riot Blockchain Bitcoin Production Jumps More Than 400% Year-on-Year Amidst Mining Exodus,"Jul 10, 2021","Riot Blockchain, a Nasdaq-listed mining company, reported Thursday on its Bitcoin production last month. The company’s numbers jumped a little more than 400% year-on-year, as a result of the increase in mining power. The recent mining crackdown in China is also helping companies like Riot to keep growing. The company plans to continue increasing its mining resources after acquiring 43,500 miners from Bitmain.Riot Blockchain, an American Bitcoin mining company, delivered its Production and Operations updates for June on Thursday. The company reported growth on the bitcoin mined of more than 400% year-on-year. It produced 243 bitcoin this June, a big increase from the 48 bitcoin mined in the same month last year. The company has produced 1,167 bitcoin this year. These numbers represent an increase of 130% compared to last year.There is a key fact that allows Riot Blockchain to achieve these results: The Chinese mining exodus. Caused by the regulatory crackdown in China, the decrease of hash power securing the network created a profit opportunity for some companies. The recent difficulty adjustment, one of the biggest drops in Bitcoin history, seems to be creating unique opportunities to get into bitcoin mining.This situation is expected to continue for some time till Chinese mines manage to relocate. A report from Hashrate Index predicts that between 30% and 40% of this hashrate will travel to the U.S. However, these relocations may face delays of up to one year considering the logistics that surround Bitcoin mining.Riot Blockchain is already on its way to expanding mining operations. Earlier this year, the company announced the purchase of more than 42,000 S19j Antminers from Bitmain for $138.5 million. This deal secures more mining muscle for Riot starting from next November. Also, the company acquired Whinstone in May, one of the biggest bitcoin mining operation data centers in Texas. This acquisition allows it to secure a working location and energy for the acquired miners.At the time of writing, Riot Blockchain stock sits at $32.83. Bitcoin currently trades at $33.8K.What do you think about Riot Blockchain’s recent spike in bitcoin production? Tell us in the comment section below.

690,Israel Begins Seizure of Bitcoin Donations Collected by Hamas,"Jul 10, 2021","Israel’s Defense Minister Benny Gantz has ordered the seizure of cryptocurrency funds raised by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. His department has reportedly started taking control over digital wallets used by the terrorist group to collect crypto donations from abroad. Minister Gantz approved the seizure of the wallets on June 30, the Times of Israel reported on Friday. The National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) published a list of targeted addresses and wallet details used by Hamas to raise funds in bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. They were identified during a joint operation with the Ministry of Defense.The publication adds that the stockpiles of cryptocurrency were being managed from the Gaza Strip, which is under the control of Hamas. The wallets were employed by the Palestinian organization in its efforts to collect money from foreign sources following the 11-day conflict with Israel in May. The seizure has affected the Al Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing.According to a blog post by blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, the investigation focused largely on analysis of open-source intelligence such as social media posts and blockchain data. The blockchain analysis reveals the movement of donation funds to exchanges. Chainalysis published a graph showing bitcoin transactions carried out by addresses listed by the NBCTF, many of which have been attributed to individuals involved in donation campaigns.“The orange hexagons represent deposit addresses hosted by a large, mainstream cryptocurrency exchange and controlled by individuals named in the NBCTF announcement,” explains Chainalysis. “On the graph, we see how funds moved to those exchange addresses from Hamas donation addresses, often passing first through intermediary wallets, high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges, and money services businesses (MSBs),” the company detailed.According to the report, two addresses named in the announcement received funds from addresses associated with the Idlib office of Bitcoin Transfer, a Syrian cryptocurrency exchange connected to terrorism financing cases. A third address received funds from a Middle East-based MSB that had previously received funds from the Ibn Taymiyya Media Center (ITMC), another organization linked to terrorism financing.Besides BTC, the ministry intercepted payments in ETH, XRP, USDT, and DOGE, the Times of Israel claims. The crypto cash has been seized in accordance with Israel’s Counter-Terrorism Law from 2016. In a statement released by the defense department, Benny Gantz was quoted as saying:The intelligence, technological and legal tools that enable us to get our hands on terrorists’ money around the world constitute an operational breakthrough.According to Noa Mashiah, CEO of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, “the seizure and forfeiture of Hamas’s donations proves that Bitcoin is a safe currency.” He elaborated that “criminals who make use of this financial system will find out the hard way that the open transaction log, the blockchain, will expose them and allow law enforcement agencies to act against them.”The executive said that the news of the confiscation marks “a significant improvement over the anti-money laundering ban and also over international bank accounts hidden behind a bank secrecy wall.” He insisted that the operation proves regulators in Israel should “adopt and use” bitcoin “as it makes it possible to expose the bad and do good with the good.”“Once you go beyond the boundaries of the blockchain to the worlds of trading platforms, you immediately lose anonymity and then, as in the present case, states and law enforcement agencies are able to locate and freeze the currencies of criminal and terrorist organizations,” added Omri Segev Moyal, CEO of cybersecurity firm Profero. He also noted that “when the network is completely exposed, you can very accurately track the trajectory of the coins and locate their final destination.”Hamas called on its supporters to send bitcoin in 2019, when the Islamist movement needed the money to deal with its financial problems. A few months later, the terrorist group established an experimental program to collect money via an elaborate system designed to facilitate international cryptocurrency donations.What do you think about Israel’s seizure of cryptocurrency funds raised by Hamas?

Back in August 2018, Wozniak revealed he was participating with a crypto startup and spoke highly about bitcoin. “It’s so independent,” Wozniak said at the time. “It’s kind of like the internet when it was brand new… I was amazed at the technology behind it,” Wozniak added. Still months before the internet comparison, Wozniak told an audience at the Nordic Business Forum in Sweden that he wasn’t obsessed with bitcoin either.“I had bitcoin to experiment with and when it shot up high, I said, ‘I don’t want to become one of those people that watches it, watches it and cares about the number,’” Wozniak said at the time. Speaking at the Talent Land Jalisco 2021 event this week, Wozniak had a similar outlook and highlighted that he doesn’t invest in bitcoin. The event which was 100% in digital format, saw more than two million attendees dedicated to the development of technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship projects.Despite not investing in bitcoin, Wozniak said that the leading cryptocurrency was still a very profound invention.

692,123-Year-Old Hydroelectric Plant Sees New Life Mining Bitcoin — Revenue 3x Higher Than Selling to the Grid,"Jul 9, 2021","On Thursday local reports from Mechanicville, the city located in Saratoga County, New York, say that an old hydroelectric plant constructed back in 1897 was almost dismantled, but today the plant is mining bitcoins. The Mechanicville facility is considered one of the oldest renewable energy plants in the world, and it’s now making “more money with bitcoin than selling the electricity” to the grid.In the historic district of Mechanicville, New York, there’s an 18.3-acre site that is considered one of the oldest renewable energy facilities in the world. Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant was built in 1897 by the Hudson River Power Transmission Company and years ago the plant was almost shut down. The plant is now owned and operated by Albany Engineering Corp (AEC) and the company signed a deal with National Grid in order to have continued access to cheap renewable energy.Jim Besha, AEC’s CEO, told local reporters that AEC is currently making 3X more money than it would be selling electricity to National Grid, the multinational electricity, and gas utility company. “We can actually make more money with bitcoin than selling the electricity to National Grid,” Besha remarked in a recent interview. The firm only makes $0.03 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) selling power to National Grid. Besha further said:It’s the best (type of bitcoin mining) because we’re using renewable energy. We’re just doing it on the side, experimenting with it. We’re buying used servers.The site leverages the powerhouse built in 1897, an earth embankment, and a concrete non-overflow dam. Furthermore, the power site also utilizes a 700-foot-long concrete gravity overflow dam. AEC has dedicated a lot of capital and resources toward extensive renovations and in 1989 the facility was recorded in the National Register of Historic Places. According to Besha, the AEC CEO is a little skeptical of bitcoin and he told the press the firm immediately converts to cash.Besha said that he would have liked to sell the renewable energy to National Grid, but the multinational electricity and gas utility company reneged on an old agreement. AEC has had a long-running legal battle with National Grid who signed a contract with AEC in 1993. The deal was that the Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant and AEC would sell power to National Grid priced just under the going market rates.However, when Besha got the Mechanicville operation licensed, National Grid called the company and allegedly said: “We’re not going to honor this contract. And if you don’t like it, take it to the judge.” AEC got the plant 100% operational but Mechanicville’s local news reports note that the original 1800s machinery had a hard time maintaining a profit. That was until bitcoin mining changed the trend.What do you think about the old Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant mining bitcoins?

694,11% of Central Bankers Consider 'Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin' Gold Alternatives: UBS Survey,"Jul 8, 2021","A UBS survey finds that central bankers see benefits in investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. 28% see benefits from cryptocurrency being an uncorrelated asset and “11% would consider it as an alternative to gold.”The 27th Annual Reserve Management Seminar Survey by UBS explores the prospects of cryptocurrencies as investments for central banks. This survey, conducted between April and June, questioned central bankers from close to 30 central banks in all regions globally, UBS explained. According to Switzerland’s largest bank, this survey “is among the most authoritative depictions of official reserve management activities available.”Central bankers were asked what the motivation for central banks to invest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin would be. The most popular answer was “Learning/ building up knowledge about crypto investing process and investment management.” UBS described, “83% of participants believe that the learning process itself of investing and managing this new asset class would be valuable for their institution.”The second most popular answer was “Uncorrelated asset.” The third was “Signaling technical progress of the institution.” Another common answer was “Gold alternative (independence from Western financial system).” UBS wrote:28% of participants see benefits coming from cryptocurrencies as an uncorrelated asset, and a further 11% would consider it as an alternative to gold.Central bankers were also asked specifically whether they see cryptocurrencies displacing gold as a safe haven asset in the future. Among respondents, 84% said no, 0% said yes, and 16% said they did not know. “A majority of 84% of participants do not believe that cryptocurrencies will displace gold as a safe haven,” UBS noted.The survey also asked central bankers about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). 46% of respondents indicated that CBDCs and cryptocurrencies will co-exist, noting that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will not be displaced by central bank digital currencies. Meanwhile, 33% believe that CBDCs will displace cryptocurrencies.What do you think about this survey? Let us know in the comments section below.

695,"Yield App Launches DeFi Bitcoin Fund, Gives Users up to 12% APY","Jul 8, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. ESTONIA — JULY 8, 2021 — YIELD App, the decentralized finance (DeFi) wealth management platform bridging traditional and digital finance, is pleased to announce the launch of its Bitcoin Fund, allowing users to earn high-interest returns on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). This will consist of a base annual percentage yield (APY) of 6% on BTC with a further 6% available in YLD rewards.*The fund will initially be available to YIELD App Tier 5 users only. These are users of the YIELD App platform that hold 20,000 YLD tokens or more in their on-platform wallets and who are entitled to the maximum APYs available. Tier 5 users will be able to deposit unwrapped Bitcoin into the YIELD App Bitcoin Fund from today, 07:00 UTC Thursday, July 8, until 07:00 UTC Sunday, July 11, or until an initial fund cap of 500 BTC is reached. Unwrapped Bitcoin is BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, rather than synthetic BTC tokens used to trade the asset’s value on other blockchains like Ethereum. If, after this period, there is any allocation remaining, the fund will be opened to all users for a further 24 hours from 07:00 UTC Sunday, July 11, until 07:00 Monday, July 12, or until the cap is reached. The minimum deposit accepted into the fund is 0.25 BTC.In addition to the 500 BTC cap, which ensures that the YIELD App portfolio team is able to deploy funds into the most stable, high-yielding Bitcoin opportunities for its users, the fund will be closed until October 10, 2021. Investors that remain in the YIELD App Bitcoin Fund for the full initial period will receive their principal investment and the interest they have earned in both BTC and YLD at the end of the term. During this period, the YIELD App team may open the fund for further investment beyond the 500 BTC cap, subject both to demand and favorable market conditions. This considered and controlled approach to the launch of its highly anticipated Bitcoin Fund reflects YIELD App’s long-standing commitment to safety and stability. These safeguards will ensure the stability and market-leading APY of the YIELD App Bitcoin Fund, which will join the wealth management platform’s USDC, USDT, and ETH offerings. This well-rounded suite of funds offers investors the opportunity to earn up to 20% on crypto’s biggest currencies. Commenting on the launch of the YIELD App Bitcoin Fund, Tim Frost, CEO of YIELD App, says: “This represents the realization of one of our biggest goals and a singular opportunity for users to invest into DeFi using their Bitcoin. There remain few platforms in this space that offer this, with many requiring users to wrap their Bitcoin first. Instead, YIELD App is taking the complication out of investing Bitcoin into DeFi by allowing users to deposit BTC directly with us.“With the YIELD App Bitcoin fund, users need only deposit their Bitcoin onto our platform and invest. Our portfolio team will then place funds into the highest-yielding, most secure Bitcoin opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. “The fund launch comes at a time that many long-term HODLers of BTC are looking for a safe harbor for their assets as they weather current volatility. We hope these long-term investors use YIELD App to earn up to 12% APY on this flagship digital asset and we look forward to welcoming them into the fund.”Since its public launch in February 2021, YIELD App has gained more than 44,500 users and grown its on-platform managed assets to more than $135 million. The huge success and leading APYs of its existing USDC, USDT, and Ether (ETH) funds have seen the wealth management platform attract the attention of both individual and corporate customers, with the firm now managing the treasuries of over 30 companies.YIELD App is part of the DeFi ecosystem, which refers to a breadth of financial instruments and tools built on top of blockchains like Ethereum. DeFi removes traditional financial intermediaries and provides equal access and opportunities to everyone by using technology that is open, transparent, and immutable. Many of DeFi’s most popular protocols have taken familiar aspects of conventional finance (such as borrowing, lending, and insurance) and rebuilt them from the ground up, all powered and made possible through blockchain.DeFi has continued to set new records this year. Between January 1 and June 30, 2021, DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) has climbed from USD $21.1 billion to $107.5 billion: a 409% increase. However, while DeFi’s growth has been spectacular, accessibility has hampered mainstream adoption. YIELD App bridges the divide through an intuitive, secure platform backed by DeFi’s most innovative protocols. In the near future, YIELD App will launch additional funds, fiat ramps, in-app token swaps for each token pair, and card services.*Please visit the YIELD App blog for full terms and conditions of the YIELD App Bitcoin Fund About YIELD AppYIELD App believes that everyone should have access to the best investment opportunities. Its mission is to unlock the full potential of digital assets, combine them with the most rewarding opportunities available across all financial markets and make these available to the world. To achieve this, the company provides an innovative wealth management platform that bridges traditional and decentralized finance in the easiest way possible.

696,"Bitcoin Sinks Below $33K, Analyst Says BTC at ‘Dangerously Low Levels’ While ETH Rests at ‘Comfortable Levels’","Jul 8, 2021","Bitcoin and a number of popular digital assets have been dropping in value over the past 24 hours, as bitcoin has slipped below the $33K handle. The entire market capitalization of all 10,000+ crypto assets in existence has shed billions during the overnight trading sessions, and the crypto economy currently rests at $1.38 trillion, down more than 6% since yesterday. Traders are focused on what will happen next in the land of crypto markets, as prices have started to dip after a long period of consolidation. At 7:00 a.m. (EDT), the price of bitcoin (BTC) slid to a low of $32,100 per unit but has regained some of the losses. 24-hour statistics show BTC has lost 6.4% during the last 24 hours and 2.87% during the last seven days.BTC is 49.64% down from the all-time high it captured three months ago. Meanwhile, bitcoin dominance has dropped to 44.3% and ethereum (ETH) dominance has climbed higher in recent times (18.3%). BTC is currently trading for $32,518 per unit at the time of writing.Ethereum holds the second largest position on Thursday, in terms of market capitalization with $251 billion. ETH has slid over 9% today but across the last week, ETH is up a touch over 2%. At press time, ether is swapping for $2,155 per unit and has close to $8 billion in 24-hour global trade volume.Out of the entire top ten list of crypto coins, cardano (ADA) has managed to hold back losses. ADA has shed 5% today but the crypto asset is up over 3% over the course of the trailing seven days. The biggest gainer on Thursday is hyperion (HYN) which is up over 73% and the biggest loser is the tokenstars token TEAM which is down 53% in the last 24 hours.In a markets update note sent to Bitcoin.com News, Alex Kuptsikevich, the Fxpro senior financial analyst explained that “bitcoin is at dangerously low levels.” Kuptsikevich said that there’s been a summer lull in crypto markets lately, but it may just be “the calm before the storm.”“Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has lost 7% and is trading around $32.3K,” Kuptsikevich said. “The price dynamic of the first cryptocurrency with seriously reduced trading volumes is considered a worrying sign. After all, if the market is affected by a small number of open positions, then any small storm could turn into a large-scale sell-off, disrupting an avalanche of stop orders. The current levels near the local lows of the last two months make us watch with bated breath for further movements.” Kuptsikevich continued:The decline of the first cryptocurrency under $30k is likely to trigger a new wave of liquidation. But the most alarming thing for crypto-enthusiasts is that such an outcome will underscore the prolonged nature of the correction, increasing speculation around a new ‘crypto winter’ like in 2018.Kuptsikevich said that whether or not a ‘crypto winter’ comes to fruition, we will find out soon enough. Even though BTC is resting at dangerous levels, ether is at “a quite comfortable level.” “The project is consistently moving along the roadmap of the transition to PoS. The developers have the confidence of market participants, and Goldman Sachs recently called ethereum more promising than bitcoin,” the market analyst added.What do you think about today’s crypto market movements?

697,Crypto Wallet Recovery Service KeychainX Can Save Your Bitcoin,"Jul 8, 2021","Whenever the prices of digital assets skyrocket, social media gets flooded with stories of people that could be millionaires now but forgot the keys to wallets they opened a few years before. But if this happened to you, don’t lose hope, cryptocurrency wallet recovery service KeychainX can save your money.KeychainX is a bitcoin wallet recovery service operating since 2017. In the last 6 months alone, the company recovered wallet keys for about 100 clients from all over the world and you can see some of their raving reviews on Trustpilot where KeychainX has an almost perfect 4.9 ‘Excellent’ score.The service covers all kinds of situations such as recovering lost Bitcoin wallets from wallet.dat files, Dogecoin wallet passwords, blockchain second or first passwords, Android wallet or spending PIN, Ethereum from JSON files, and Ethereum presale wallets. KeychainX can even decrypt your blockchain.info 15,17,19 or 21 word mnemonic seed that is no longer supported by blockchain.com itself.This means that as long as you have more than just the public key for a wallet, there is a chance to unlock it. So if you have a cryptocurrency wallet which you can’t access the funds in for any reason, make sure to give KeychainX a try right now and avoid being just another anecdote about someone that lost their fortune due to misfortune. You don’t want to tell your children one day after bitcoin reaches one million dollars that you lost the keys and didn’t do anything about it.The company shares some of the stories of its successes on Medium that show the varied capabilities needed for this line of business. For example, KeychainX recently shared how it recovered a Dogecoin wallet worth over $3 million for a retired truck driver that purchased the coins back in 2015 for about $1500. The client forgot his PIN number and only had a few hints to share with the team such as his birthday and so on. Trying to check all possible 12 digits combinations that the client thought was the length of the PIN using brute force alone would have taken more than a lifetime, but KeychainX developed a custom smart algorithm based on his hints that unlocked the wallet in no time.Another interesting KeychainX success story shows how it recovered an old blockchain.info wallet with more than a 12 words story mnemonic seed – something many people mistakenly think is impossible. The client only remembered 17 words out of his mnemonic seed which was used to backup the wallet, and the team had to use a combination of brute force and a lot of “source code archeology” to recover the funds from the no longer supported wallet. The story also shows the lengths that KeychainX is willing to go to for its clients and the sheer spark of genius that is sometimes needed in the search for these lost fortunes.To learn more about the company visit KeychainX.io or just send an email to KeychainX@protonmail.com if you need to talk about password recovery.This is a sponsored post.

698,Goldman Sachs Sees More Potential in Ether Than Bitcoin,"Jul 7, 2021","Global investment bank Goldman Sachs says ether is the cryptocurrency with the highest real use potential and it could overtake bitcoin as the dominant digital store of value.Goldman Sachs shared its view on the future outlook for bitcoin and ether in a note published Tuesday. The investment bank’s analysts reportedly argued that ether’s real use cases could make the cryptocurrency the dominant digital store of value, overtaking bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency. They wrote:[Ether] currently looks like the cryptocurrency with the highest real use potential as Ethereum, the platform on which it is the native digital currency, is the most popular development platform for smart contract applications.However, Goldman Sachs prefers gold, stating that neither cryptocurrency will be able to overtake gold anytime soon. The analysts explained that cryptocurrencies are not a direct competitor to gold as a safe haven asset due to their high volatility.Goldman described: “Gold is competing with crypto to the same extent it is competing with other risky assets such as equities and cyclical commodities. We view gold as a defensive inflation hedge and crypto as a risk-on inflation hedge.”Furthermore, the investment bank pointed out that the competition between different cryptocurrencies is hurting crypto’s ability to become a safe asset class for investors. Goldman concluded:This competition among cryptocurrencies is another risk factor that prevents them from becoming safe haven assets at this stage.Goldman Sachs is not the only one seeing more potential in ether than bitcoin. Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money Show said he moved all of his money out of bitcoin and invested in ethereum for a similar reason cited by Goldman Sachs. In April, rival investment bank JPMorgan explained why ether was outperforming bitcoin.Do you agree with Goldman Sachs on bitcoin, ether, and gold? Let us know in the comments section below.

One of the offerings includes a bitcoin card which the online banking platform is going to launch as early as this month. By the end of July, Monobank’s clients will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency using a new banking card that will support crypto transactions. The news was announced by the company’s cofounder Oleg Gorokhovskyi on Telegram.The Ukrainian mobile bank also plans to introduce an integration with a cryptocurrency exchange which has not been disclosed yet. According to sources quoted by Forklog, Monobank will accomplish the task in partnership with the crypto trading platform Whitebit.Gorokhovskyi further emphasized that the development phase of the project is already completed. At this stage, Monobank is only awaiting approval from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the country’s central bank.This fall, the mobile bank will offer investors an option to trade company shares through a U.S.-based platform that is yet to be announced. Monobank’s team is currently working to introduce eSIM support with a mobile operator and improve its acquiring services. Both initiatives will be presented in August, the report details.In February, Oleg Gorokhovskyi revealed he had “a fairly large portfolio of bitcoins” and advised his friends and followers on Facebook to buy cryptocurrency. At the time, the entrepreneur stated he was convinced by Tesla’s $1.5 billion crypto purchase that “bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.”Later the same month, Monobank discontinued support for SEPA transfers from Binance citing restrictions imposed by foreign correspondent banks. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has been expanding its presence in Ukraine and in June launched an advertising campaign in major Ukrainian cities.Last year, the East European country was ranked among the world’s top crypto adopters but the government in Kyiv is yet to introduce comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and the related industry. A revised bill on “On Virtual Assets” should be voted this summer.What do you think about Monobank’s offering of crypto products and services? Let us know in the comments section below.

701,Bitcoin Taproot Support Lags at 27% — Even Though Soft Fork Is Opt-in Supporters Beg Nodes to Update,"Jul 6, 2021","On June 12, the crypto community celebrated the fact that the Bitcoin network locked in Taproot support in order to activate the largest upgrade the protocol has seen in four years. 24 days later, Taproot support via Bitcoin nodes has only reached 27.55% and upgrade supporters are pleading with the community to update their nodes.Data stemming from the Twitter account called Taproot Signal shows that Taproot-supporting nodes only represent a touch over 27% of the known public node count. 72.45% have not updated their Bitcoin nodes to support the upcoming activation period in November. The upgrade, however, is a soft fork which means nodes don’t necessarily have to upgrade to remain within Bitcoin’s ruleset. Similarly, the soft fork Segregated Witness (Segwit) suffered from a lack of node adoption as well, when it was activated in 2017.Segwit’s adoption rates didn’t kick in with much higher levels until March 2018. Segwit adoption levels tapped a high of 53% on February 23, 2021 and today levels have risen higher, reaching 71% according to Segwit usage data recorded on July 6. After Segwit was implemented many bitcoiners pleaded with node operators and major crypto businesses to adopt the soft fork. The same can be said about Taproot today, as crypto supporters are posting on forums telling node operators to update to a Taproot supporting node as soon as possible.Over two weeks ago, one Redditor wrote: “Less than 25% of nodes enforce Taproot, UPDATE your nodes.” In the forum post, people argued over what would happen to a node that hasn’t upgraded to 0.21.1. One person said that if a node hadn’t upgraded to 0.21.1 after block 709,632, and “a miner were to produce a block that violates the Taproot rules” they may “see that block as valid while anyone who has upgraded sees it as invalid.” Another Redditor responding to the comment disagreed with the person’s assessment.“As far as I understand there’s no way to produce a block that ‘violates the tap root rules though,’” the individual wrote. “It’s a soft fork. Old nodes and updated nodes both see pre-taproot and post-taproot blocks as valid. Old nodes will see taproot UXTOs as ‘anyone can spend’ outputs… but in reality, they aren’t. It works on all versions.”On July 5, 2021, another Reddit post on r/bitcoin appeared pleading with bitcoiners to update their nodes. “If you run a node, remember to update it to support Taproot, only 27% do so far,” the Redditor’s thread said. Again this thread was met with debate after a few Redditors told the post’s author that Taproot is a soft fork and these upgrade posts are useless.“Taproot is a soft fork, so opt-in,” the most up-voted comment on the thread says. “You don’t have to upgrade. That being said, I run two full nodes both of which contain the latest bitcoin core version. Why not [support] freedom of speech? Even though I might not have to say anything that important, at least at the moment.”The popular Twitter account @mikeinspace also discussed the Taproot upgrade subject on Tuesday. Referring to the 27% support thread on Reddit, he told his 11,000 Twitter followers he’s been seeing a number of these types of Taproot upgrade posts on social media.“I’m seeing a lot of this ‘it’s your duty to upgrade’ lately,” he tweeted. “I thought soft forks were meant to be optional and you can happily go about enforcing consensus while ignoring vendor extensions.” The Twitter handle Mike in Space also mentioned the notorious Chris DeRose, former host of the broadcast “Bitcoin Uncensored.” Mike in Space added:There was a great DeRose rant about the immaculate Bitcoin that is now lost down the memory hole. It involved Mircea Popescu, Bitcoin vendor extensions and the bitcoin dot foundation, the one true Bitcoin.On Twitter, there is a great number of people asking or telling node operators to support Taproot as soon as possible. “Upgrade your nodes to Taproot and get your friends to do it too,” Francis Pouliot told his 68,000 Twitter followers.“The financial incentive for nodes to upgrade to Taproot is that it increases the value proposition for Bitcoin, and hence helps your stash appreciate,” another individual said on June 13. In fact, on June 13, a great swarm of posts on Twitter shows a number of tweets pleading with bitcoin node operators to update.What do you think about the lack of adoption Taproot is seeing today and the posts pleading with node operators to update as soon as possible? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

702,Brazilian 'King of Bitcoin' Arrested for Involvement in Alleged $300 Million Fraud,"Jul 6, 2021","Claudio Oliveira, owner of the Bitcoin Bank in Brazil and known as the ‘King of Bitcoin,’ was arrested yesterday for his alleged participation in a fraud scheme involving $300 million. According to inquiries from federal authorities, Oliveira faked a Bitcoin hack back in 2019 in which his company lost a significant amount of bitcoin. More than 7,000 customers lost their funds in this fake hack.The Federal Brazilian Police apprehended Claudio Oliveira yesterday for his supposed involvement in a $300 million fraud scheme. Oliveira, who owned the Bitcoin Bank, reported a bitcoin hack on his company back in 2019. But according to police investigations, this was a staged crime to cover the withdrawal of these cryptocurrencies. Brazilian police also seized eight luxury cars and jewels.Operation Daemon, which cracked down on the Bitcoin Bank scheme, resulted in the arrest of four more individuals. The police searched 22 locations in one of the biggest operations against a cryptocurrency organization in the country. 90 police officers participated in the sting.The police organized this task force after the Bitcoin Bank failed to collaborate in the investigations of the alleged fake Bitcoin hack. While the authorities investigated the crime, the organization received a judicial order allowing them to keep operating. Oliveira is now facing charges of embezzlement, money laundering, criminal organization, and crimes against the national financial system.The police found that the Bitcoin Bank was running a so-called private blockchain. If the customers deposited their funds, the system faked operations that showed customers making gains on arbitrage. But the funds going in and out showed inconsistencies with audits made to the system by forensic investigators. After the seizure, Federal Police took ownership of the cryptocurrency accounts managed by the Bitcoin Bank. However, they claim there are not enough funds to pay all creditors.This alleged Ponzi scheme affected more than 7,000 investors, including employees and service providers from the group. However, this is not the first time Oliveira has had a run-in with justice. The King of Bitcoin committed crimes of the same nature in the U.S., according to Brazilian investigators. Also, Oliveira committed embezzlement and document forgery in Switzerland back in 2000.What do you think about the alleged $300 million fraud operated by the King Of Bitcoin?

704,"As Miners Leave Bitcoin in Droves, Space Allocation Dedicated to Filecoin and Chia Surges","Jul 5, 2021","While a large quantity of hashrate has stopped dedicating resources to the Bitcoin network, a great number of alternative mining ecosystems are swelling with new participants. China’s ASIC exodus has ignited a significant increase in demand for accessing storage power on both Filecoin and Chia’s proof-of-storage networks. Both networks have seen space allocation spike significantly since the bitcoin mining crackdown in China. A lot has been happening in the cryptocurrency mining space recently, as the industry is seeing a massive shift since the start of the bitcoin mining crackdown in various Chinese provinces. SHA256 hashrate dedicated to the Bitcoin (BTC) network has plummeted over the last few weeks and the hashrate drop caused the network’s mining difficulty to dip close to 28% this past weekend. Interestingly, this was the largest epoch mining difficulty drop BTC has ever experienced and in two weeks it may be even larger.At press time, according to coinwarz.com’s hashrate chart set for a one-month interval, BTC’s hashrate is 87,660,572,446,369,430,000 hashes per second or 87 exahash per second (EH/s). The mining difficulty drop made it easier and more profitable to mine BTC but alternative crypto assets that leverage different consensus algorithms have been far more profitable. Today’s most profitable consensus algorithm is Blake256R14 which can mine the crypto asset decred (DCR).A machine that boasts more than 52 terahash per second (TH/s) — and pulls 2,200 watts off the wall with an electricity consumption rate of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) — can see profits of up to $116 per day using DCR exchange rates on July 5. A machine that can mine the Ethash algorithm and coins like ETH, ETC, CLO, PIRL, and UBQ can get roughly $42 per day using today’s crypto exchange rates, the same electrical consumption with 750 megahash per second (MH/s), and 1,350 watts of power.These specific consensus algorithms have seen an increase since the SHA256 exodus, but in comparison to times prior to China’s crackdown, these networks also lost a considerable amount of hash during the shift as well. Two notable crypto networks, however, saw the opposite effect as space allocations dedicated to the Chia network and Filecoin network have grown exponentially. In mid-October, Bitcoin.com News reported on Filecoin’s miner strike which saw a standoff between members of the Filecoin mining community.At that time, Filecoin’s “Network Storage Power” according to filfox.info was 600 pebibyte (PiB) of effective storage. When the first warnings of a miner crackdown in China came out of Inner Mongolia back in March and went viral, Filecoin’s effective storage rate skyrocketed. The effective storage rate climbed higher and higher as each week passed, as today’s rate is 7.087 exbibyte (EiB). he network crossed a milestone of 1 EiB on November 24, 2020. The network crossed a milestone of 1 EiB on November 24, 2020, then a great majority of the effective storage increase stemmed from Q2 2021.The crypto asset network Chia has also seen the space allocated to the Chia network grow exponentially and after the Sichuan crackdown, it spiked considerably higher than usual. Chia network statistics show 30,505 PiB of allocated storage dedicated to the chain on July 5. It was only 26,718 PiB on June 22, which shows it has increased 14.17% since the start of the Sichuan mining crackdown that week. The Chinese journalist Colin ‘Wu’ Blockchain tweeted about the demand that Chia and Filecoin mining was seeing on June 20 and since then space allocated to both networks has increased a great deal.“The computing power of Chia and Filecoin in China has not been affected,” the regional reporter noted that day. “[The] Chinese government mainly controls the power sector to crack down bitcoin mining, but they consume less electricity. Their computing power is continuing to rise, and some bitcoin miners may switch to them,” he added.What do you think about the other consensus algorithms besides Bitcoin’s SHA256 seeing more demand these days? What do you think about the exponential increase in space allocated to Chia and Filecoin’s networks? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

The payment processor now features a URL shortener that allows users to monetize content on any site on the net. Also, Prompt.cash added Paypal API integrations, making it easier for merchants to test Bitcoin Cash payments seamlessly.Prompt.cash, a hosted permissionless bitcoin cash (BCH)-based payment processor, is adding a slew of important updates that extend the functionality of the platform. While the platform launched just three months ago, they are already introducing new features to make its proposal more useful to its users. One of these interesting additions is a URL shortener. This will allow users to monetize access to any website. Prompt.cash can also accept any Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens minted using the Bitcoin Cash chain.While URL shorteners are not something new, most companies providing this service are fiat-based. Prompt.cash uses a bitcoin cash address to send the received payment directly to the wallet of the user. This provides instant redemption of the funds received. It also gives the user an advantage compared to traditional service offerings. Using these fiat-based competitors, the customer needs to withdraw the funds manually after a certain amount is reached.One of the biggest problems that incipient payment processors face is the cost of integration. Many companies that would like to test new payment processors will often pass on them. This due to the price associated with integrating them into their structure. Prompt.cash is aware of this issue and is working to minimize the friction and cost of adding bitcoin cash payments to every platform out there.Ekliptor, the developer of Prompt.cash, stated that Paypal Rest API integration will go a long way in achieving this goal. Ekliptor stressed:Compatibility on the API layer enables websites using Paypal to try out bitcoin cash payments without investing many resources and developer knowledge.As a result of this work, merchants can modify any of the thousands of plugins out there to make it compatible with Prompt.cash. Consequently, just by changing a couple of things, these merchants will be able to offer bitcoin cash payments in no time.To make things even easier for merchants, Prompt.cash features integration with many popular platforms. For this reason, static pages, WordPress, Node.js, PHP, WHCMS, and Android-based platforms can integrate Prompt.cash payments. In addition to these benefits, Prompt.cash offers examples for noncoders to understand what needs to be done and apply it to their own platforms.What do you think about Prompt.cash functionality upgrades?

707,US SEC Commissioner Says Bitcoin ETF Approval Long Overdue,"Jul 4, 2021","SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce says that the regulator should have approved a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. a long time ago. She emphasized that it is not the SEC’s job to approve or reject applications based on the merits of the underlying investment itself. “People should make their own decisions” whether to buy bitcoin, said the commissioner.
A commissioner with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Hester Peirce, talked about the prospects of the SEC approving a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. Peirce is also known in the crypto circle as “crypto mom.”The SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF. However, the industry is hopeful that things will change this year since the SEC has a new chairman, Gary Gensler, who taught crypto and blockchain courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Commissioner Peirce described:I thought that if we had applied our standards as we have applied them to other products, we would already have approved one or more of them. With each passing day, the rationale that we have used in the past for not approving seems to grow weaker.The commissioner has previously stated that she sees a double standard at the SEC when it comes to bitcoin products. She explained that the SEC is asking exchanges and would-be bitcoin ETF sponsors for more assurances than what it asks for traditional, equity-based products.“People of a regulatory mindset, when they encounter something new like this, say, ‘Oh, wait a minute: The market for bitcoin looks a bit different than the markets we’re used to,'” Peirce opined. She disagreed with the SEC’s decision to reject a bitcoin ETF application by the Winklevoss twins back in 2018.Noting that the bitcoin market now looks more like an established market that has more participation from institutional and mainstream retail investors, Peirce remarked:I think the markets have matured quite a bit.In May, Peirce said, “We’re seeing more interest coming from institutional quarters than we have in the past. I think that will continue … as people are looking to diversify their portfolios, I think people are also likely to look more to the crypto space.”Peirce is not alone. Investment banks and fund managers are seeing the same trend and a growing number of them have begun investing in bitcoin or offering crypto services to clients, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup.The commissioner emphasized that it is not the SEC’s job to approve or reject applications based on the merits of the underlying investment itself, especially if exchanges are meeting statutory requirements for protecting investors from fraud.Pointing out that “Bitcoin now is so decentralized. The number of nodes that are involved in Bitcoin is large, and the number of people who have an interest in keeping that work decentralized is very large,” Commissioner Peirce concluded:People should make their own decisions: If people don’t want to buy bitcoin because they think it’s manipulated, they shouldn’t buy bitcoin.Do you think the SEC will finally approve a bitcoin ETF this year? Let us know in the comments section below.

708,Bitcoin Mining Report Claims Miner Energy Consumption Mix 56% Sustainable in Q2,"Jul 4, 2021","During the last three months, there’s been a significant focus on the effects bitcoin mining has on the global environment. While many have claimed bitcoin mining is bad for the environment and many others have stressed that it affects the environment in a positive way, either way, most are relying on unreliable and old data from a few years ago. On July 1, 2021, the recently formed Bitcoin Mining Council published a report that claims 56% of the hashrate uses sustainable energy resources.Bitcoiners are hoping Elon Musk has noticed a new report published by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) that shows more than half of the hashrate leverages sustainable energy to mine bitcoin. BMC published the report on July 1, 2021, and as soon as it was online posts about Elon Musk changing his mind started to appear.“Tesla said they wouldn’t again accept BTC until energy consumption reached 50% from renewables,” one Redditor said on Saturday. “Now that BTC uses 56% renewable energy, I wonder if Tesla will soon start accepting BTC again.” The ‘Tesla accepting bitcoin again’-Reddit post on r/bitcoin has clocked in more than 5,700 upvotes.The BMC report explains that the organization collected information on miners leveraging sustainable energy from “over 32 percent of the current global Bitcoin network in its first-ever voluntary survey.” The results of the survey indicate that members of the BMC are utilizing electricity “with a 67% sustainable power mix.” The BMC report states:Based on this data it is estimated that the global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix had grown to approximately 56 percent, during Q2 2021, making it one of the most sustainable industries globally.The data is very different from the Coinshares’ report published over three years ago and the unreliable data stemming from Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) and the digiconomist.net index. Both the digiconomist’s and Cambridge’s data have significant discrepancies between both electrical consumption estimates and both have mining maps that have not been updated since April 2020.Microstrategy and its CEO, Michael Saylor, a member and founder of the BMC, said he was pleased to hear the results.“I am pleased to see that the Bitcoin mining industry has come together, voluntarily, to provide critical information to the general public and policymakers, especially as it pertains to clarifying common misconceptions about the nature and scale of Bitcoin energy usage,” Saylor said. “This survey— the first quarterly release of many we expect to come— draws on data from miners around the world. As I’ve stated before, just because the Bitcoin network is decentralized doesn’t mean it has to be disorganized,” Saylor added.The BMC is made up of members like Blockware Solutions, CCU.ai, Celsius Network, Compute North, Core Scientific, Enegix, Frontier Mining, Galaxy Digital, Hive Blockchain, Ankr, Argo Blockchain, Atnorth, Bit5ive LLC, Bitfarms, Bitfury, Bitquest, Bitriver, Blockcap, HMTech, Hut8, Marathon Digital Holdings, New Data Ventures LLC, Riot Blockchain, and SBI Crypto. BMC spokesperson Saylor also released a video that goes over some of the data found in the global mining report.What do you think about the use of green energy in bitcoin mining jumping to 56%?

709,Bitcoin Mining Profitability to Rise 35% While Ousted Chinese Miners Face Delays Relocating,"Jul 4, 2021","Analysts are predicting a rise in Bitcoin mining profitability of about 35% during the short term. This would be the effect of the bitcoin mining crackdown in China. Since the crackdown happened, a significant portion of hashrate stemming from the Bitcoin network disappeared. Ousted miners are struggling to relocate, and some might not even make it due to the complicated logistics of these operations. All of these reasons combined can create a great time for new companies to enter the mining space.Bitcoin’s mining profitability is expected to rise in the short term due to the complex situation miners are facing in mainland China. According to Whit Gibbs, CEO, and founder of Compass, this will continue in the short to medium term. Gibbs told CNBC:We are expecting a period of much higher mining profitability for Compass Mining clients. We expect miners to be approximately 35% more profitable.Compass is a bitcoin mining company that started offering its services this year, after getting $1.7 million in a seed round last February. The mining exodus will likely benefit incipient providers and companies like them in the future. Other crypto analysts concur. Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap, a mining behemoth in North America, stated:We are expecting a revenue and profit increase for the foreseeable future. This was an unexpected gift to the network, not just on revenues but on decentralization and sustainable energy metrics.Bitcoin just experienced one of the biggest difficulty drops in its history shaving more than 27% in one hit. This means that most miners will reap more rewards in the short term. This mechanism is implemented to maintain Bitcoin operativity when facing hashrate fluctuations like the ones that happened last month.Analysts and mining company officers estimate this bonanza period could last up to 15 months. Mining bitcoin is not a straightforward process, and the hardware needed cannot be moved easily along borders. The logistics of relocating a Bitcoin mining operation need for months or even years to develop. Some operations might not even relocate and could choose to get out of the mining business due to fears of retaliation in mainland China.This is the case of Liu Hongfei, a Chinese Bitcoin mining operator. Hongfei told Reuters:If the government doesn’t allow it, I just have to quit.While the situation is dramatic for established miners in the country, the exodus is opening new opportunities for entrepreneurs around the world.What do you think about Bitcoin mining profitability rising in the short term?

710,"‘We Want You,’ Pro-Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis Invites Crypto Miners to Wyoming","Jul 4, 2021","U.S. lawmaker and bitcoin advocate Cynthia Lummis has indicated that cryptocurrency miners are welcome in Wyoming. In a recent interview, the senator defended bitcoin’s carbon footprint and later invited miners to her home state on social media. With the ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in China, companies in the business of coin minting have been actively looking for friendlier jurisdictions to relocate their operations. Some perspective destinations have emerged in the U.S., with Texas and Florida now being among the prominent examples. Both states can offer crypto miners access to affordable energy.Wyoming, which has maintained a positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies for some time, can easily become the next bitcoin mining hotspot. Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a well-known supporter of Bitcoin, recently took to Twitter to welcome crypto miners to the state urging them to reach out.PS – If you are in the #Bitcoin mining space, please reach out. We WANT you in Wyoming. https://t.co/OUPAEYTXTG— Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) July 3, 2021Lummis tweeted her call on Saturday posting an excerpt of her interview from the CNBC Financial Advisor Summit in which she defended Bitcoin’s environmental record. The senator referred to research conducted at the University of Cambridge, according to which bitcoin mining uses about 40% renewable energy while the indicator stands at only 12% in the non-bitcoin mining economy. She emphasized:Bitcoin mining is already more environmentally adapted to non-carbon emitting energy sources.The Wyoming representative in the U.S. Senate also turned attention to the “innovation that’s happening behind the scenes” in the crypto mining industry, providing an example with her own energy-rich state. Wyoming is a producer of oil and gas and when a new well is drilled, initially it’s not connected to a pipeline, Lummis explained. Bitcoin miners are helping to utilize the gas that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere with mobile mining platforms that can be installed and operated close to the source.“I would say – don’t judge bitcoin mining as an energy bad guy. There are a lot of things going on to prove otherwise,” the lawmaker concluded. Cynthia Lummis also noted that cryptocurrency mining is helping the drilling industry in a way that keeps carbon out of the air while using it to produce another product in the form of bitcoin.The race to attract crypto miners is on in the U.S. with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez recently giving his best to entice mining companies that are leaving China. “Hey, we want you to be here,” Suarez addressed them in another interview with CNBC, highlighting that his region relies on nuclear power which is a source of clean and cheap electrical energy.Do you expect many crypto miners from China to relocate to the United States?

The terms of the deal will begin with a ten-year lease of a retired printing plant.Greenidge details that the printing plant at one time drew approximately 80 megawatts (MW) of energy but it believes the Spartanburg facility has “potential beyond that capacity.” The company will leverage the site’s existing electrical framework and also utilize clean nuclear power.“This is an important step in Greenidge’s strategy to build upon our unique expertise in environmentally sound bitcoin mining at additional locations across the country,” Jeff Kirt, the CEO of Greenidge explained in a statement.Like many bitcoin mining industry firms, Greenidge has continued to expand operations. Back in March, Greenidge announced plans to be publicly listed via Nasdaq through a merger with Support.com. The year prior, the company launched a fleet of mining rigs at the 65,000 square-foot natural gas utility plant in Dresden New York.During the merger, the bitcoin mining operation Greenidge said it hopes to have 500 MW online by 2025. Furthermore, Greenidge also stressed on Friday that the company plans to “invest a portion of its mining profits in renewable energy projects across the country.”The Greenidge Generation power plant located in New York’s Finger Lakes region leverages flare gas or excess gas to power the firm’s fleet of bitcoin miners. Similarly, companies like Upstream Data, Crusoe Energy Systems, and EZ Blockchain work with systems that leverage flare mitigation mechanisms.“We have a superior team with proven expertise in this emerging field,” Kirt said. “LSC’s Spartanburg site, with its favorable energy mix, capacity potential, and business-friendly climate, is the ideal next location for us. The site’s existing electrical infrastructure should allow us to commence our data mining buildout almost immediately,” the Greenidge executive added.What do you think about Greenidge’s expansion to South Carolina?

712,JPMorgan Predicts When Bitcoin Bear Market Will Be Over,"Jul 3, 2021","Global investment bank JPMorgan has predicted that the bitcoin price slump will likely be over when the cryptocurrency’s dominance rises back above 50%. “I think that’s another indicator to watch here in terms of whether this bear phase is over or not,” the firm’s analyst explained.JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has shared his view of when he expects the current bitcoin bear market to be over. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, the analyst explained that the bitcoin price slump will likely end when the cryptocurrency’s market share of all cryptocurrencies climbs back above 50%. He explained:A healthy number there, in terms of the share of bitcoin as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap, is 50% or above. I think that’s another indicator to watch here in terms of whether this bear phase is over or not.“It was like 60% back in the beginning of April,” the JPMorgan analyst recalled, adding that bitcoin’s relatively low market share was a negative signal that suggests interest in BTC remains relatively subdued. However, Panigirtzoglou pointed out that bitcoin’s market share had risen in recent weeks.Bitcoin’s dominance is currently about 46% and BTC’s price stands at $34,609 at the time of writing, based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.While the JPMorgan analyst sees little sign of big investors buying the dip in bitcoin, he noted:The flow into ethereum funds has slowed over the past two to three weeks, at the same time as the flow into bitcoin funds … has improved. That means there is perhaps a relative value opportunity that some institutional investors are seeing to buy bitcoin and sell other cryptocurrencies.Last week, another JPMorgan analyst said that the crypto market is healing even though it is not yet healthy. Furthermore, the near-term outlook for the crypto market is “challenging,” the analyst added, warning of more sell-offs.Panigirtzoglou said earlier this month that there was “an unusual development” in the bitcoin futures trend. “We believe that the return to backwardation in recent weeks has been a negative signal pointing to a bear market,” he wrote.Meanwhile, JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, said last month during his congressional testimony before the House of Financial Services Committee regarding cryptocurrency that his personal advice to people is to stay away from bitcoin. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that JPMorgan’s clients want exposure to the cryptocurrency.What do you think about JPMorgan’s bitcoin prediction? Let us know in the comments section below.

713,Bitcoin Still Commands the 9th Largest Market Capitalization in the World,"Jul 3, 2021","Despite the drop in value during the last three months, the leading crypto asset bitcoin is still the ninth most valuable asset in the world in terms of market capitalization. Moreover, bitcoin could flip some of the world’s most valuable assets in the future, as the crypto asset is 67% away from turning over tech giant Google’s overall valuation and other valuable companies and commodities.Bitcoin is still the ninth most valuable asset in the world according to assetdash.com statistics, the market capitalization web portal for global assets. Three months ago, bitcoin (BTC) touched an all-time high (ATH) at $64,895 and the price is still more than 45% below that range.The leading crypto asset also touched a low ten days ago at $28,600 per unit but managed to recover around 14% of the losses since then. Of course, at ATH bitcoin held a much higher position on assetdash.com’s list, outpacing companies like Facebook (Nasdaq: FB). On Saturday, bitcoin’s (BTC) market valuation jumped over Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A).Bitcoin (BTC), with its $648 billion market valuation, is still among the top assets in the world above firms like JPMorgan Chase, Nvidia, Visa, Alibaba, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).The market capitalization of bitcoin is double the size of valuations for companies like Toyota, Procter & Gamble, and Walt Disney Company. Bitcoin’s valuation is four times the size of businesses like Phillip Morris, the Royal Bank of Canada, Anheuser-Busch, and Citigroup.The creators of assetdash.com also developed another page called the “BTC Flippening” which shows how close the crypto asset is to surpassing the nine other leading asset valuations. For instance, bitcoin is very close to surpassing Tesla as it is roughly 1% away from jumping over the electric car company’s valuation.BTC is 36% away from Facebook, 57% away from silver’s entire market cap, and 67% away from Google. The top dog on the list, of course, is gold with its $10 trillion market valuation. Still, as far as gold is concerned, BTC is 6% of the way there and 28% into Apple’s gigantic $2.29 trillion market capitalization.Ethereum’s valuation isn’t too shabby either, as it holds a $258 billion capitalization at the time of writing. This puts ethereum’s (ETH) valuation at the 35th position above valuable companies like Netflix, Verizon, Coca-Cola, and Vanguard.The third-largest cryptocurrency valuation, which belongs to tether (USDT), has an overall capitalization of around $62 billion, while cardano (ADA) has $45.3 billion. Both USDT and ADA don’t make the assetdash.com list, as the 100th position is held by Toronto Dominion Bank with its $128 billion market valuation.What do you think about bitcoin still being the ninth most valuable asset on the planet today?

715,Bitcoin Blocks Will Soon Be 27% Easier to Find — Miners Brace for the Largest Difficulty Drop in BTC's Lifetime,"Jul 2, 2021","Bitcoin, the leading crypto asset in terms of market capitalization, has seen the cryptocurrency’s network hashrate drop considerably during the last two weeks. On Saturday, July 3, the network’s mining difficulty will see the largest epoch drop in history as the difficulty is set to slide by more than 27%.This weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) is set to experience the largest difficulty drop ever recorded during the crypto asset’s lifetime. At the time of writing, BTC’s mining difficulty is 19.93 trillion and is expected to drop 27.04% by Saturday morning (EDT). In bitcoin mining, the network’s difficulty is the parameter that keeps the average time between BTC blocks consistent.The difficulty parameter is the metric that shows how difficult it is to mine a bitcoin block and the higher the difficulty, the more hashpower is needed to find a block.When the mining difficulty on the network is lower, it is far easier for bitcoin miners to find blocks. A difficulty that keeps rising alongside the hashrate means an attacker will have to spend enormous amounts of resources to breach the system.Bitcoin’s upcoming difficulty change comes at a time when Chinese miners have been told to operate elsewhere and a great portion of hashpower went offline this past Monday. During the last BTC difficulty change at block height 687,456 on June 13, 2021, the global hashrate was around 142.68 exahash per second (EH/s).Since block height 687,456, BTC’s hashrate dropped by 39% to 86.5 EH/s. Bitcoin’s network difficulty has dropped two times prior to the upcoming 27% slide expected on Saturday.The largest difficulty drop so far in BTC’s lifetime, took place on October 30, 2011, the day before Halloween.At that time, the difficulty slid 18.03 %, at BTC block height 151,200 when the global hashrate was a meager 8.61 terahash per second (TH/s). For some perspective, today a single next-generation bitcoin miner crafted by Microbt or Bitmain commands hashpower of around 100 TH/s.Interestingly, BTC did not see a large drop like the one in 2011 until block height 655,200 recorded on November 3, 2020. At that time last year, the mining difficulty slid 16.05% and the hashrate was around 120.12 EH/s.Usually, BTC’s difficulty goes up more so than the number of times it has slid down during the course of its lifetime. At Bitcoin block height 685,440, BTC’s mining difficulty slid 15.97% on May 29 when the hashrate was roughly 150 EH/s.At today’s 86.5 EH/s hashrate and the current 19.93 trillion difficulty, block times have been longer than ten minutes on average. After the Bitcoin difficulty change on Saturday, the time between blocks should smooth back over to closer to ten minutes on average.Since June 29, BTC’s hashrate has increased a great deal as 30-day hashrate statistics show the network’s hashpower was only 66 EH/s that day. Saturday’s difficulty change will not only be a milestone but will also make it much easier for miners to continue ramping up resources.What do you think about the mining difficulty change set to happen on Saturday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

716,US State Department Official Wants El Salvador to 'Ensure Bitcoin Is Well Regulated',"Jul 2, 2021","The U.S. Department of State’s undersecretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, has explained during a press conference that the U.S. has urged El Salvador to be responsible with the country’s new bitcoin law. Nuland told the press that the U.S. was taking a “tough look at Bitcoin” and that Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele needs to “ensure that it is well regulated.”According to statements from a senior U.S. State Department official, the U.S. hopes El Salvador will be responsible with the country’s new bitcoin tender law enacted on June 9, 2021. The undersecretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, explained that she had a meeting with the Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele and they discussed the crypto asset bitcoin (BTC). The American diplomat stressed to Bukele that after the Colonial Pipeline ransomware case, the U.S. was taking “another tough look at bitcoin.”“I did suggest to the president that whatever El Salvador chooses to do, you ensure that it is well regulated, that it is transparent and that it is responsible, and you protect yourself against malign actors,” Nuland told reporters at the press conference.El Salvador has had issues getting world leaders to agree with the new bitcoin tender law’s benefits. The World Bank rejected a request from El Salvador for assistance and the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, recently discussed the subject with disparagement. At the time, Lagarde reiterated that the ECB’s policy toward bitcoin (BTC) has not changed. Benoit Coeure, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also criticized Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele’s bitcoin tender law.In addition to the senior U.S. State Department official’s statements after meeting with Bukele, the U.S. State Department named 14 Salvadorans that are members of the Bukele regime as “corrupt” and “undemocratic actors.”This announcement has made people think that the U.S. is cracking down on El Salvador for choosing to leverage bitcoin. “Unconventional Warfare (UW) in action,” explained the popular anonymous analyst Plan B on Twitter. “See link below for what happens to countries that refuse IMF demands [and choose] freedom,” Plan B tweeted.Even the economist Steve Hanke said: “First, it was El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law. Now, the State Department is wielding the hammer.” Hanke has warned that Salvadoran bitcoin adoption could lead to a “complete collapse of the economy.” Moreover, Hanke and two other authors that publish papers on applied economics at Johns Hopkins University wrote a paper that says: “El Salvador’s bitcoin law is destined to be caught in the FATF’s regulatory web.”“Under the Bitcoin Law, El Salvador will undoubtedly be ensnared in the Financial Action Task Force’s web of regulations,” Hanke explained on Twitter. “In this working paper, I identify 27 of the FATF’s ‘red-flag’ behaviors that will be impossible for El Salvadorans to comply with.” Victoria Nuland’s recent comments and the U.S. State Department’s “Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors Report” suggest that American bureaucrats agree with Hanke’s opinion.What do you think about the American diplomat’s recent statements and the U.S. State Department’s latest undemocratic actors report?

717,"US Senator's Advice: Buy, Hold, Save Bitcoin for Retirement as Congress Floods Economy With Trillions of Dollars","Jul 2, 2021","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has encouraged “people to buy and hold” bitcoin in their portfolios. “I encourage them to save bitcoin for their retirement, for their future,” she said, adding that with Congress flooding the economy with trillions and trillions of dollars, “there’s no way” the value of the U.S. dollar will not be debased.U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis talked about bitcoin in an interview at the CNBC Financial Advisor Summit Tuesday. Responding to the question of what her ideal crypto future would look like, the pro-bitcoin senator described:I would like to see cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, become part of a diversified asset allocation that are used in retirement funds and other opportunities for people to save for the future.Not only she would like to see retirement funds investing in “bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that are good stores of value,” the senator from Wyoming said that she would “also like to see individuals be able to use bitcoin and cryptocurrencies of their preference that are safe, that have met the hurdles of anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act.”Senator Lummis further shared: “For me, I see bitcoin as a great store of value. I buy bitcoin and I hold bitcoin.”When asked about how much bitcoin she has, Lummis replied, “Well I only have, I think, five bitcoin,” adding that she paid $330 for her first BTC.Responding to a question about whether she invests in other cryptocurrencies, like ether, Lummis said she does not. “The only one I really understand is bitcoin. Now that doesn’t mean that ethereum might not have benefits as well,” the senator clarified.Reiterating that she sees bitcoin as “a great store of value,” the senator said she currently does not see the cryptocurrency “as a means of exchange,” elaborating:I want to buy and hold. I encourage people to buy and hold. I encourage them to save bitcoin for their retirement, for their future.She explained that is “because, as the Congress spends trillions and trillions of dollars, and is flooding our economy and the world economy with U.S. dollars, there’s no way that we cannot debase the value of the U.S. dollar. So, I worry about having all of our retirement monies denominated in U.S. dollars.”Lummis emphasized that one should have a diversified portfolio. “So as part of diversification, having a very diverse asset allocation, so you don’t have all your eggs in one basket, I think one of the strongest stores of value for the long run is bitcoin,” the senator concluded.Do you agree with Senator Lummis?

We believe winning in Brazil is critical for 2TM Group and are excited to take part in this incredible journey.Fintech companies and crypto solutions have gathered mainstream attention in Latin America and the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Latin America made its debut on the Brazil Stock Exchange last week. Softbank Group and the firm’s Latin America Fund have been growing portfolio companies based on these trends. The Softbank Latin America Fund also backs fintech firms such as Creditas, Cortex, Inter, Loggi, Konfio, and Ualá.The multinational conglomerate Softbank has been into crypto and blockchain technology for quite some time. In October of 2019, Softbank announced it was working with Tbcasoft, and IBM on a cross-carrier blockchain technology project. Softbank also worked with Tbcasoft when the firms created a blockchain-based “Identification & Authentication” Working Group the same year.One of the Tokyo-based company’s portfolio firms is also leveraging crypto-asset solutions. Just recently, in mid-April 2021, the Softbank-backed global space provider Wework recently revealed it was accepting cryptos and keeping digital assets on its balance sheet.Mercado Bitcoin’s financing from Softbank follows the company’s Series A round in January 2021, which was co-led by Parallax Ventures and G2D/GP Investments. Mercado Bitcoin aims to use the funding to “accelerate growth across 2TM Group’s portfolio.” 2TM Group’s portfolio also includes the crypto wallet provider Meubank and it hopes to launch a fund called the “Bitrust” in the near future.What do you think about Softbank funding 2TM Group and its subsidiary Mercado Bitcoin with $200 million in financing?

721,George Soros' Investment Fund Is Reportedly Trading Bitcoin Products,"Jul 1, 2021","The Hungarian-born American billionaire investor George Soros’ investment fund is actively trading bitcoin investment products, according to reports. Undisclosed sources reveal that bitcoin trading got the green light from the Soros Fund Management chief investment officer (CIO) Dawn Fitzpatrick.At the end of March, Bitcoin.com News reported on George Soros’ investment fund and the company’s CIO Dawn Fitzpatrick. At the time, Fitzpatrick said that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a “threat” to bitcoin (BTC), but she also said she doesn’t think CBDCs will “be successful in permanently destabilizing bitcoin.”Now a report stemming from undisclosed sources speaking with the news publication website thestreet.com, says Fitzpatrick has allowed the Soros’ investment fund to trade bitcoin products.The reporter, Michael Bodley, cites two sources that have said the CIO Dawn Fitzpatrick has given “the internal green-light to actively trade bitcoin.” According to Bodley’s report, the sources further noted that Soros Fund Management is also researching other types of digital currency investment vehicles.Rumors about the billionaire’s Soros Fund Management — his family investment firm —investing in cryptocurrencies have been appearing since 2018. During the first week of April 2018, Bloomberg claimed Adam Fisher, an investor at Soros Fund Management, had allegedly received the approval to trade crypto assets.Months before that rumor, George Soros discussed bitcoin and crypto assets at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “Well,” Soros said at the event, “cryptocurrency is a misnomer, and it’s a typical bubble which is always based on some kind of misunderstanding.” Soros continued:Bitcoin is not a currency. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value. And a currency that can fluctuate twenty-five percent in a day can’t be used, for instance, to pay wages because wages could drop twenty-five percent in a day. So, it’s a speculation based on a misunderstanding.We don’t know if the opinion Soros held of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has changed, but in 2021 the public caught wind of Soros Fund Management joining New York Life and Morgan Stanley in investing in the bitcoin-focused investment company NYDIG.Then the fund’s CIO Dawn Fitzpatrick spoke about BTC in a positive light and said the investment firm thinks that the crypto space “is at an inflection point.” Meanwhile, George Soros is a very controversial figure in the world and his background has made people distrust him.When the news of Soros Fund Management reportedly trading bitcoin products hit the crypto forums, there were lots of conspiracy jokes littering the threads. “I don’t trust this guy, he’s a real-life super villain,” one person said on the subreddit forum r/bitcoin.“Soros is one of the most evil creatures out there… Best thing we can do is buy more BTC so he can get less,” another individual wrote.What do you think about the news of Soros Fund Management reportedly trading bitcoin products?

722,There Are Now Twice as Many 2021 'Bitcoin Deaths' Compared to 2020's BTC Obituaries List,"Jun 30, 2021","Bitcoin is down in value 45% since the crypto asset’s all-time high (ATH) three months ago and the downward movement has ignited significant speculation about another bear market. Other skeptics believe that bitcoin has died, as the web page that hosts bitcoin obituaries indicates 2021 bitcoin deaths have doubled in comparison to all the bitcoin obituaries in 2020.The price of bitcoin (BTC) is lower than it was three months ago when the crypto asset touched an ATH of $64,895 per unit roughly 90 days ago. Since then, BTC has been consolidating above the $30K region and many are uncertain of what prices will come next.Then there are those who are certain that bitcoin is dead or at the very least prepping for its own funeral as they believe the value is surely headed to zero. The infamous bitcoin obituaries web page, hosted on 99bitcoins.com, showcases these types of “bitcoin is dead” skeptics who have written long bitcoin eulogies since 2010.Bitcoin obituaries have doubled in 2021, in comparison to last year, which indicates that critics are more willing to pounce on the crypto asset’s market slides. There were 14 bitcoin deaths recorded by 99bitcoins.com in 2020 and today there are 29 deaths for 2021.As of today, there are roughly six months left until 2022, and this year’s BTC deaths record may compete with years like 2019 (41) and 2015 (39). It will take a lot of deaths for bitcoin to catch up to the record high in 2017 when 99bitcoins.com recorded 124 deaths.The very first bitcoin obituary was recorded on December 15, 2010, and the author’s decade-old eulogy was called “Why Bitcoin can’t be a currency.” Fast forward to today and bitcoin died just recently on June 21, when the renowned author Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote a summary of bitcoin’s failures called “BTC Is Worth Exactly Zero.”“In its current version, in spite of the hype, bitcoin failed to satisfy the notion of ‘currency without government’ (it proved to not even be a currency at all), can be neither a short or long term store of value (its expected value is no higher than 0),” Taleb said.“[Bitcoin] cannot operate as a reliable inflation hedge, and, worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, safe haven for one’s investments, shield against government tyranny, or tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes,” the “Black Swan” novelist further stressed.On Youtube, economist Maurice Hoefgen gives the bitcoin obituaries web portal its next death that precedes Taleb’s scathing review. Hoefgen in his interview with DW News on June 17, says bitcoin doesn’t have good characteristics of money. The economist wholeheartedly believes that “Over the long term bitcoin will fail.”The 27 other 2021 bitcoin obituaries all have similar reasons as to why BTC is resting in its casket and prepping for a funeral service. Reasons such as volatility, scarcity, speculation, hype, criminal use, government crackdowns, and environmental arguments are the main talking points in these eulogies.Many bitcoiners would say that it’s safe to say that bitcoin is not dead. However, it’s guaranteed to be doubted and considered a complete failure along the way by pessimists who don’t understand Satoshi’s creation.Even the fax machine-loving Nobel laureate and economist, Paul Krugman, took a crack at the crypto asset this week. Krugman didn’t say BTC was dead but referred to JP Koning’s critique and called it a natural Ponzi scheme.“Nice essay via Ftalphaville,” Krugman said. “Bitcoin has clearly failed in its mission to become money, but its value is sustained because it has become a sort of natural Ponzi scheme.” However, not everyone appreciated Krugman’s borrowed assessment from Koning’s essay.“Honest question: is there any example of a Ponzi scheme which had a second major rally to new ATH’s after the first growth phase collapsed?” Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees asked in response to Krugman’s tweet.What do you think about the quantity of bitcoin obituaries doubling in 2021? What do you think about the statements from Paul Krugman? Let us know what you think about these subjects in the comments section below.

723,Payments Giant NCR Bringing Bitcoin Trading to 650 U.S. Banks and Their 24 Million Customers,"Jun 30, 2021","Payments giant NCR and New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) are collaborating to allow 650 U.S.banks to offer bitcoin trading to their 24 million customers through their mobile applications.New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) said Wednesday that 650 banks and credit unions in the U.S. will soon be able to offer bitcoin trading to their customers through their mobile applications.The bitcoin option is made possible through a collaboration between NYDIG and enterprise payments giant NCR. NYDIG is a bitcoin technology and financial services subsidiary of Stone Ridge, a $10 billion alternative asset manager.NCR’s president of digital banking, Douglas Brown, was quoted by Forbes as saying:We’re firm believers in the benefits of crypto and the strategic application. And that’s true for our banking relationships, as evidenced by NYDIG, and across retailers as well as restaurants and the like.Founded in 1884 as National Cash Register, NCR now has over 34,000 employees in 160 countries; its products are distributed in 141 countries. The company was acquired by AT&T in 1991 but re-established as a separate company in 1997. NCR’s website says that the company is “the #1 global POS software provider for retail and hospitality” and “the #1 provider of multi-vendor ATM software.”According to research firm RBR, NCR is the largest provider of point of sale software to grocery and other retail stores globally, with a 45% market share. The company serves 180,000 restaurants, retail chains, hotels, and more.Bitcoin purchased via NCR’s platform will be sourced from various regulated OTC exchanges and sold at a markup, the publication conveyed, adding that the bank will set the transaction fee. NYDIG will provide custody of the bitcoin. However, Brown said that in the future, NCR may custody the cryptocurrency itself.NCR’s chief technology officer, Tim Vanderham, is also working with nearly 200,000 restaurants and other retail clients to help them accept bitcoin payments, Brown further revealed, noting NCR may also make bitcoin trading available via 800,000 ATMs and more.NYDIG has been busy partnering with various companies to enable financial institutions to offer bitcoin trading to their customers. The company announced a collaboration with Finserv last week to let 10,000 financial institutions offer bitcoin trading. It is also collaborating with Q2 to enable 18 million users to buy and sell bitcoin.What do you think about NCR making it possible for 650 banks to offer bitcoin trading to their clients?

He faces five years in federal prison.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday that a Texas resident, Mark Alexander Hopkins, has pleaded guilty to “illegally operating a cash-to-cryptocurrency conversion business.”The 42-year-old man, who calls himself “Doctor Bitcoin,” pleaded guilty to one count of operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah detailed:This defendant ignored federal law and allowed fraudsters to use bitcoin to operate under the radar of law enforcement. We are determined to rid the bitcoin marketplace of anyone who knowingly helps criminal actors stash illegal profits inside crypto wallets.Hopkins admitted to running a cryptocurrency exchange business, converting U.S. dollars to cryptocurrency, primarily bitcoin, for a fee. He also admitted that he frequently sent BTC to customers’ crypto wallets without taking additional steps in verifying the source of the cash.Court documents show that Hopkins helped a customer identified as “M.H.” convert U.S. dollars from a lottery scam he was running in Nigeria to bitcoin. Over the course of about a year, he conducted 37 transactions with the scammer converting between $550,000 and $1.5 million.According to the DOJ:Hopkins admitted he promised not to get involved in the details of M.H’s business dealings, but told M.H. how to circumvent financial institution reporting requirements by keeping deposits under $9,500, and directed M.H. to lie to financial institutions about the purpose of the business.Hopkins admitted that he was not licensed to conduct a crypto exchange business in the state, and was not registered as a money transmitting business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.Noting that the defendant “failed to follow federal laws that require money transmitting businesses to verify customers’ names, date of birth, and address – a law aimed at identifying those engaged in unlawful activity – and failed to file currency transaction reports for high-value cash-in transactions,” the DOJ stated:Hopkins now faces up to five years in federal prison.Do you think this Doctor Bitcoin should go to jail for five years?

725,Ark Invest Files for a Bitcoin ETF,"Jun 29, 2021","Ark Invest, the investment company founded by Cathie Wood, filed for approval to offer a Bitcoin ETF yesterday. 21Shares, an investment firm with experience launching related products in Europe, will help Ark to launch the product. Ark Invest is the latest of several funds showing interest in launching a Bitcoin ETF this year.Ark Invest, the famous asset management firm, filed for approval to launch a Bitcoin ETF yesterday. The firm, founded and managed by Cathie Wood, will partner with 21Shares, a firm with experience in this field. The proposed instrument will be called ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. It will track the performance and price of Bitcoin providing exposure for regulated markets.While the price of Bitcoin has stagnated over the last month, tech and crypto-oriented funds expect demand to pick up again. Cathie Wood is a big bitcoin proponent and much of Ark’s holdings are based in cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase and also in bitcoin itself.Wood predicted the price of Bitcoin could reach $500,000 due to its inherent properties, while also stating this might take some time due to the emotional character of the market. In any case, she is very positive about bitcoin’s prospects for the future.Ark Invest is the latest of several companies that have filed proposals for a Bitcoin ETF just in the last year. Propelled and inspired to chase an ETF offering by the rise of the bull market were companies like Galaxy Digital, VanEck, Fidelity, SkyBridge Capital, NYDIG, WisdomTree Investments, and BitWise. However, the SEC has not approved any of these proposals and some are already being delayed.Gary Gensler, the new Chairman of the SEC, made clear that the cryptocurrency sector needed more regulation. About cryptocurrencies, he previously stated:This is a quite volatile, one might say highly volatile, asset class, and the investing public would benefit from more investor protection on the crypto exchangesIn light of this, experts think the possibility of having a Bitcoin ETF this year is very low. All of the problems the SEC has called out on Bitcoin are still there. Price volatility and market manipulation claims are still present. But asset managers are still trying to grasp the opportunity to be the first to offer this kind of product in America. And now Ark Invest has joined the race.What do you think of Ark Invest’s Bitcoin ETF filing? Tell us in the comments section below.

726,Craig Wright Wins Default Judgment Against Cobra — Bitcoin.org Forced to Remove White Paper,"Jun 29, 2021","The self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin, Craig Wright, has won a default judgment in London’s High Court in his copyright infringement case against the pseudonymous operator of bitcoin.org. According to a report, the website and its owner Cobra must remove the Bitcoin white paper from the web portal and pay $48K in legal costs as well.Craig Wright is back in the headlines again as the self-styled Satoshi Nakamoto has won a default judgment in the U.K. against the pseudonymous Cobra. Bitcoin.com News reported on Wright’s action against bitcoin.org and Cobra at the end of January. Proceedings actually started, however, on February 24 via the Intellectual Property List of the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales.The court action caused a lot of controversy amongst bitcoiners because Wright still has yet to prove he invented Bitcoin to the greater crypto community. In fact, there is so much evidence contradicting Craig Wright’s story it’s been said he simply “thrives on attention.”“He’s had four years to come forward with proof that he is Satoshi, and I, for one, am not satisfied,” blockchain and software developer Jameson Lopp said in 2019.Following the initial filing of the copyright infringement case against bitcoin.org and the website’s operator Cobra, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) filed a civil lawsuit in the U.K. against Wright’s claims to the famous white paper.“Today, COPA initiated a lawsuit asking the UK High Court to declare that Mr. Craig Wright does not have copyright ownership over the Bitcoin white paper,” the working group said at the time. After the COPA court filing, a representative of Craig Wright, chief scientist at Nchain wrote to Bitcoin.com News and said:This is exactly what we have wanted to happen for some time and I am very pleased this body has agreed to stand up in court as I can now have my credentials judged legally.On June 28 and also updated the following day, a blog post published by ontier.digital explains that Wright has won a default judgment in London’s High Court against Cobra. The High Court judge of the Chancery Division granted Wright’s request which includes:The ontier.digital website announcement details that Cobra preferred to “maintain their anonymity.” On Twitter, bitcoin.org’s pseudonymous operator spoke about the ruling and said that it was the perfect example of why uncensorable and permissionless networks like Bitcoin are needed.“All your fiat-based assets are ultimately secured by the same legal system that today made it illegal for me to host the Bitcoin white paper because a notorious liar swore before a judge that he’s Satoshi,” Cobra tweeted. “A system where ‘justice’ depends on who’s got the bigger wallet.” The anonymous bitcoiner added:I don’t think you could get a better advertisement of *why* Bitcoin is necessary than what happened today. Rules enforced through cryptography are far more superior than rules based on whoever can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in court.What do you think about Craig Wright winning a default judgment against Cobra and bitcoin.org?

727,Mysterious Bitcoin Maximalist Mircea Popescu Allegedly Found Dead,"Jun 29, 2021","Mpex founder and Bitcoin evangelist Mircea Popescu reportedly drowned off the coast of Costa Rica, adding to the mystery surrounding the man, his purported bitcoin fortune, and what it might mean for the future of the network.Just like the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamato sparked a thrilling hunt for the true identity of the person or persons behind Bitcoin, the network has reportedly lost one of its most enigmatic and polarizing figures of the last decade.Mircea Popescu, a Romanian national and noted Bitcoin maximalist who promised to dump over one million bitcoins if block sizes were adjusted, supposedly drowned off the coast of Costa Rica on June 23rd. Confirmation of his passing has been scant, with outlets originally reporting that a Polish national had drowned.A relatively mysterious figure within the community, little is known about Popescu apart from his blogging on Trilema, support for security-focused open-source projects, and dedication to keeping the Bitcoin network unchanged despite calls for bigger block sizes.After blogging on cryptocurrency in its early years, he founded bitcoin exchange Mpex in 2012, which later became the target of a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation. Satoshi DICE, a popular gambling website that only accepted bitcoin, was listed on Romanian-based Mpex by Eric Voorhees.Eventually, the listing became a part of the SEC investigation after the offering was not approved by the regulator. Voorhees was later fined and forced to buy back the shares that were listed. During the situation, Popescu was famed for trolling the SEC, going so far as to post his correspondence with the enforcement team in his Trilema blog. His eccentricity was on full display as he set out to dismantle the SEC’s requests and lay bare the holes in their arguments for information about Mpex and client activities.Despite the little known about his personal and professional endeavors, Popescu’s commitment to open-source systems is well known. After the open-source operating system Open BSD, which has been around since the 1990s, ran into funding issues, Popescu donated $20,000 in 2014 to keep the non-profit foundation behind the software running. Given the security-centric approach of the OS and Popescu’s leanings, Mpex also employed the technology in its platform.Mired in controversy for years, Popescu left behind many quotes and sayings, some of which painted a fairly negative image of the man himself. Yet, none of his antics were taken so seriously as his promise to dump a million bitcoins in the market if changes were made to Bitcoin block sizes (this reportedly occurred in 2016), earning him the moniker “Father of Bitcoin Toxicity.” Eventually, Segwit2x, an initiative designed to double the block size to 2MB, was abandoned and cemented the network’s use of the 1MB block size.Despite never being confirmed, it was inferred that Popescu actually did command control over that vast swathe of a million bitcoin, which, if true, made him likely the only bitcoin millionaire (owner of more than one million coins). However, this figure was never confirmed. It did create concerns in light of his alleged death, though, that one million bitcoins could hit the market and cause prices to careen lower.For now, the situation remains shrouded in mystery amid the lack of formal confirmation of his passing.What do you think will happen with Mircea Popescu’s bitcoin fortune? Let us know in the comments section below.

A former hedge fund manager, Cramer co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website.The Mad Money host said last week that he would buy bitcoin again if its price falls to the $10K level. However, the cryptocurrency did not fall much further than the $30K level Cramer appeared to have sold at before bouncing back. At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin stands at $34,370 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.“I went back into ethereum” because bitcoin held at the $30,000 level, Cramer said, elaborating:I like ethereum because people actually use it much more to be able to buy things. I’m going to continue to buy ethereum. I just think it’s got a little more game because when you go buy an NFT, anything like that, everybody wants ethereum. It’s more of a currency.Last week, Cramer revealed that he sold almost all of his bitcoin because he was worried about China cracking down on cryptocurrency and bitcoin mining as well as BTC’s role in ransomware attacks.The Mad Money host was previously bullish about bitcoin, advising people to put 5% of their portfolios in the cryptocurrency because he said gold let him down. He originally went into BTC in fear of massive inflation.What do you think about Jim Cramer moving from BTC to ETH? Let us know in the comments section below.

The hashrate plummeted from 108 exahash per second (EH/s) yesterday to today’s 69 EH/s, seeing one of the sharpest declines in the network. This might be a consequence of the situation going on with miners in China. Numbers further estimate a mining difficulty drop of around 23.7% next week.The Bitcoin hashrate, the amount of work that secures the Bitcoin network, has experienced a sharp decline in the last week. In just a day, the hashrate dropped from 108 EH/s to 69EH/s, a decline of almost 35%. It’s worth noting that intraday hashrate records are not always reliable and the 35% drop may be a lower figure a few days from now.It is one of the biggest hashrate drops that the Bitcoin network has seen in the last few years and it is affecting the operation of Bitcoin’s transaction confirmation times.The BTC network only produced 77 blocks yesterday, according to data collected by Trustnodes. The bitcoin network has a defined block time of 10 minutes, so it should produce 144 blocks daily. This means that average block times have stretched to almost 20 minutes or longer between intervals.Bitcoin is designed to regulate the difficulty to achieve smoother block times. This adjustment, which is set to happen on June 3rd, would bring the difficulty down 23.7%, according to estimations from btc.com. If it is above that percentile it would be one of the largest drops in difficulty in the history of the Bitcoin blockchain if conditions stay the same.This uncommon Bitcoin hashrate drop may be the consequence of the recent crackdown the Chinese government is applying to cryptocurrency mining operations. Several key provinces in the bitcoin mining department (Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Yunan, and Xinjiang) have issued prohibitions for mining, and important centers have closed as a result of that. While it is expected that most miners will relocate to other latitudes, the exodus will be slow and painful.Even if countries like El Salvador and cities like Miami are offering incentives for miners from China, relocating a bitcoin mine is no easy task. Thousands of ASICS must be shipped, electrical installations need to be adapted and reviewed and permits need to be obtained. That’s why some believe this situation will continue for some time until miners relocate.While most analysts believed a majority of hashrate was located in China, there were and still are no reliable statistics on the issue. But these current numbers offer a clear picture of the global mining map before the mining ban in China.What do you think about the latest Bitcoin hashrate drop and the next difficulty adjustment? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

730,China's Oldest Exchange Exits Bitcoin Business Amidst Regulatory Pressures,"Jun 28, 2021","BTCC, ostensibly the first cryptocurrency exchange established in China, exited the bitcoin trading business last week. According to statements, this was the result of the continued regulatory pressure Beijing is exerting on cryptocurrency businesses. The company will now transition to blockchain-related endeavors.BTCC, the company that once ran the most prolific exchange in Asia, announced it has exited the cryptocurrency business. The company said it had sold its shares in the Singapore exchange ZG.com in May 2020. Most of the cryptocurrency exchanges based in China ran overseas years ago, during the first cryptocurrency crackdown back in 2017.But now, the government is tightening its grip on crypto to avoid capital losses. The People’s Bank of China is now targeting OTC businesses and cryptocurrency-related accounts. These P2P and OTC businesses targeted will have their accounts frozen, according to local reports. This will affect cryptocurrency brokers in the country, which now largely run the whole market due to restrictions.An offshoot of the company now operating in Hong Kong, however, issued a statement explaining the crackdown would not affect them. The company stressed that Mainland China’s restrictions would not affect its cash flow. It declared:BTCC [Hong Kong] is not impacted for now because BTCC doesn’t provide trading of cryptocurrencies, but derivatives of cryptocurrencies.The company will now shift to building blockchain-based applications. The government of China supports the use of blockchain and made it one of its focuses in its fourth industrial revolution program.While cryptocurrency exchanges are also feeling the heat from the government, miners are taking the worst hit. The government has closed several mining facilities and issued mining bans in major provinces. This has affected the operation of the ousted miners, who are now seeking shelter in other regions and countries.Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and Yunan, all provinces where cryptocurrency mining is popular, have issued warnings and ousted miners from their territories. Mike Huang, operator of a cryptocurrency farm in Sichuan, told Reuters the situation is dramatic. He stated:Mining machines are selling like scrap metal.This exodus has further affected the Bitcoin network. The hashrate (the amount of work securing the network) has been inconsistent for two weeks now, and is at 67.9 EH/s at time of writing, with a decline of over 28% since yesterday. The Bitcoin hashrate is now down almost 65% compared to its all-time high of 191 EH/s in May.What do you think about BTCC’s exit from the exchange business? Tell us in the comments section below.

731,"As Bitcoin’s Yearly Inflation Rate Dips to 1.77%, BEA Data From May Shows US Inflation Fears Are Legitimate","Jun 28, 2021","The U.S. economy is looking stagnant according to data stemming from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, as core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped 3.4% in May from a year prior. The recent PCE spike is the highest year-over-year basis change since 1992 and the statistic is fueling inflation concerns.After more than a year of lockdowns and business shutdowns alongside the massive monetary expansion introduced by the Federal Reserve, economists are worried about rising inflation. Last week the Fed revealed its possible future interest-rate decisions and global markets shuddered for a couple of days and then recovered.Northmantrader.com founder, technical analyst, and macroeconomic commentator, Sven Henrich, jokingly wrote about the manipulated markets in a blog post called “The Never Ending Rally.” Henrich remarked on how the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Neel Kashkari made markets feel better on Friday.“Last week’s trial balloon by the Fed, if that was the intent, made it clear again that this market runs not only on easy money, but also on the continued expectation of easy money,” Henrich wrote. “So the Fed followed its long adopted approach to monetary policy: Go in big, go in fast, and go out excruciatingly slow for fear of the consequences of upsetting markets.”While Wall Street is getting the benefits from the Fed, Americans returning back to work are facing an assault on their purchasing power. Even retirees are getting hammered with inflation woes as Barron’s award-winning financial columnist Gail MarksJarvis explained on Saturday.“As the pandemic fades and the country reopens,” MarksJarvis said, “retirees are emerging to the unsettling whiff of inflation. Gas prices are up more than 50% year over year. Grocery prices have climbed 2.2% overall. Airfares are up nearly 25%.”Amid the never-ending market rally for a small privileged few, core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index data was published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Friday. The data was concerning because the PCE rose 3.4% higher than the number for May 2020, which is the largest year-over-year increase in close to three decades.The BEA is a U.S. government agency that provides economic and market statistics. Every month, the BEA releases data on the total value of American consumption expenditures. The PCE price index found in the BEA’s Personal Income and Outlays report, and shows the changes in inflation tied to everyday goods and services purchased by U.S. consumers. All kinds of commodities and for-profit solutions are mixed into the PCE equation like services, nondurable goods, and durable goods.Despite the dreary PCE data, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note spiked by almost four basis points, and gold markets jumped higher as well. Similar to Henrich, economist and gold bug Peter Schiff has also been commenting on the Fed’s monetary theatrics and even published a radio broadcast called “Everything Is Awesome Because the Fed Says so.”“High inflation keeps pushing the price of oil higher,” Schiff tweeted on Friday. “So far today it’s already hit $73.40, the highest price since Oct. of 2018. Yet investors aren’t buying gold because instead of looking at what’s actually happening to oil, they believe the Fed that it’s only transitory.” Schiff added:New definition of transitory: An adverse permanent change in conditions that if fully appreciated by the public or investors would accelerate both the impact on an economy or financial markets, and the damage done to the reputations of incumbent administrations or central banks.As concerns about rate hikes and the recent PCE data rattled markets, Coinshares’ James Butterfill published a report on how data suggests that bitcoin is beginning to fulfill the role of an inflation hedge. “Observing bitcoin’s price changes relative to changes in inflation shows that this relationship is becoming statistically significant,” Butterfill’s research highlights.The researcher’s report details that it’s difficult to know if inflation is headed our way and how long it could last. The Coinshares study also notes that since the inception of the Bitcoin network, data shows “the relationship between bitcoin and inflation is currently better than between inflation and gold.”“There is increasing evidence that bitcoin is maturing as an asset,” Butterfill’s research concludes. “After the most recent FOMC statement (16th June) where an unexpectedly hawkish tone was expressed, prices moved in a very similar way to gold. This is highlighting that bitcoin is behaving as investors would expect from a real asset, by appreciating when the U.S. dollar declines and vice versa.”As Butterfill’s report highlights, it’s difficult to know or predict what the global economy will do. What makes it much worse is how unpredictable the Fed’s monetary system — with its never-ending rallies and busts — can be. Even though bankers and bureaucrats continuously tout that inflation is only 2% to 2.24%, the surging value of goods and services highlights the fact that 2% inflation is a myth.In contrast to unpredictable monetary expansion, tightening, and mythical inflation rates, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum is only 1.77%. Central banks and politicians have always leveraged a 2% target reference, but data from web portals like shadowstats.com and equipmentradar.com, clearly shows the general increase in prices for goods and services is much higher than 2%. Unlike the Fed’s system, Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum shrinks every four years during the reward halvings.Satoshi’s idea of an active supply coupled with demand and the reward rate decreasing every four years developed a predictable economic system with an inflationary rate no one can control. We can actually predict with rough estimates how much lower Bitcoin’s inflation rate per annum will be in the future. By 2025, it’s estimated that Bitcoin’s inflation will be lower than 1% and by 2028 the network’s inflation rate per annum will be 0.4%.What do you think about the recent inflation concerns and the PCE data spike? Do you think assets like gold or bitcoin are a better hedge against inflation? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

732,Oracle Vinny Lingham Still Envisions $100K This Year if Bitcoin 'Continues to Hold $30K',"Jun 28, 2021","The former CEO of Gyft and the cofounder of the project Civic, Vinny Lingham has been called an ‘oracle’ at times for correctly predicting the future price of bitcoin. On various occasions all the way back to 2016, Lingham has made correct bitcoin price calls over the years. Even though bitcoin’s price has been lower in recent weeks after shedding over 40% in the last three months, Lingham has an optimistic outlook if “$30k continues to hold.”Vinny Lingham is talking about bitcoin (BTC) price predictions again and when he does a number of people listen. Lingham has been giving price forecasts for years now, and people have referred to him as the “oracle” for guessing correctly a lot more than most people.The cofounder of the project Civic’s bitcoin predictions are not always optimistic and his calls are usually more conservative than people with outlandish forecasts. Still, Lingham, like many others, thinks there’s a possibility that BTC could reach six digits in value in 2021.“If $30K continues to hold, we’ll likely break $100K bitcoin this year,” Lingham tweeted on Sunday afternoon (ET).A number of people responded to Lingham’s tweet and one individual wrote: “The legend has been spoken. Last time he [predicted] BTC, ETH, [and] FIL and in the end [they pumped] hard. Big respect.” Another Twitter account dubbed “Ronpaul2012” also replied to Lingham and predicted: “$169,420 by Christmas.”Four days ago, Lingham also sent out a bullish tweet and reminded his 184,000 Twitter followers about a tweet he wrote on May 23. At that time in May, Lingham said: “2021 is looking a lot like 2013…” His bullish tweet on June 22, retweeted his May statement and he remarked:You heard it here first. Expect a big rally later this year…In response to the “big rally” statement one person called the commentary bold. “Pretty bold man. I like it. It hasn’t felt this bad/bearish for a long time,” the individual said to Lingham. “I think mid to low $20K’s looks like a great opportunity…if we get it.”The Civic cofounder also discussed El Salvador earlier this month, when president Nayib Bukele and Salvadoran congress made BTC legal tender in the country. While sharing an exploding head emoji, Lingham wrote that the implications are mind-blowing.“Bitcoin has just gone from being non-state sanctioned money to state-sanctioned money,” Lingham tweeted. “I’m really not sure if this is good or bad yet. #popcorntime,” he added.What do you think about Vinny Lingham’s recent tweets about bitcoin hitting $100K and the expectation of a big rally later this year?

733,"Mexico's Third Richest Man Recommends Bitcoin, His Bank Is Working to Accept BTC, Says Fiat Money Is a Fraud","Jun 27, 2021","Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Mexico’s third-richest man and founder of Grupo Salinas, sees bitcoin as an asset with extraordinary properties, describing the cryptocurrency as “gold for the modern world.” He recommends bitcoin, thinks that fiat money is a fraud and the idea of the U.S. dollar being a hard currency is a joke.Ricardo Salinas Pliego talked about bitcoin and fiat money in an interview with José Rodríguez, published last week. He explained that he considers bitcoin a financial asset so it is not important to him whether BTC is a currency or not. The billionaire pointed out that precious metals are also not currencies, noting: “You cannot go to a store with a gold coin and buy a computer. You have to exchange the gold for fiat and then you buy the computer.”Citing a number of advantages, including divisibility, ease of transfer, and the simplicity of storage without counterparty risk, the billionaire opined:For me, bitcoin is an asset that has extraordinary properties … All the advantages that bitcoin has, for me, make it gold for the modern world.Salinas Pliego is also the owner of Mexico’s Banco Azteca. His current net worth is $15.8 billion, according to Forbes.He also recommends having bitcoin in investment portfolios. “Bitcoin is an asset that has international value, that is traded with enormous liquidity worldwide and that, therefore, should be in any portfolio,” he affirmed.Salinas Pliego noted that scarcity is a major factor making bitcoin so valuable and different from fiat money and cryptocurrencies with unlimited supplies. However, the third richest man in Mexico believes that there are some useful cryptocurrencies, such as privacy coins monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC).Turning attention to how governments view bitcoin and what he thinks of fiat money, Salinas Pliego described:Governments don’t like bitcoin … it burns them that people can get out of their fiat trap, because that is what fiat money is, a fraud … The fraud fiat is inherent to the fiat system and we can see it today in the U.S. … the dollar as hard currency is a joke.He shared that when he started his professional career in 1981, the exchange rate was 20 Mexican pesos to $1. “Today, on the other hand, we are at 20,000 [pesos] for $1 … that is here, in Mexico, but if we do it in Venezuela, Argentina or Zimbabwe, the figures lose all proportion,” he opined.As for risks, he said the government could ban bitcoin but he does not believe that it would be the end of the cryptocurrency, elaborating:Governments, people with power, could decree that it is illegal … [but] I think it would continue to be used even if it were illegal, but many people will be afraid of it.The billionaire was also asked hypothetically that if he could travel 30 years into the future and could choose money, assets, or goods to take with him, which he would choose.He laughed and said that he would not carry “any stinking fiat money, not a peso, not a fiat paper” on his journey through time. He would not carry gold either due to its portability problem. “The problem with gold is where you keep it, that is, the custody of gold bars is not an easy thing,” he noted, adding that for this reason, he chooses bitcoin. “In case of political, social, or financial turbulence, you have a better chance of running away with your bitcoins than with some gold bars, so I would take the bitcoins with me,” he concluded.On Sunday, the billionaire confirmed that 10% of his portfolio is in BTC, adding:I recommend the use of bitcoin, and me and my bank are working to be the first bank in Mexico to accept bitcoin.What do you think about Ricardo Salinas Pliego’s view on bitcoin and fiat money?

734,John McAfee's Hideout Was a Secret Bitcoin Mining Farm,"Jun 27, 2021","John McAfee was reportedly hiding out in a Spanish “ghost hotel” with a bitcoin mining farm in the basement prior to his arrest. Clues from images and messages the antivirus tycoon posted on social media point to a semi-abandoned hotel owned by a Russian.After John McAfee was reportedly found dead in his prison cell in Spain, reports have emerged that the antivirus tycoon’s hideout place was a secret bitcoin mining farm.The place was a semi-abandoned hotel in Cambrils called Daurada Park Hotel, El Pais publication reported Friday. Cambrils is a coastal town in the province of Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain.The hotel is dubbed “a ghost hotel” by the Spanish publication El Confidencial because reservations were pretty impossible to make as no one answered the phone even when the hotel was still operational. The publication tried to contact the hotel about the McAfee story back in 2018 but to no avail. There are few reviews of the hotel on Tripadvisor and none after 2017. Most reviewers found the hotel to be “terrible.”Daurada Park Hotel was bought by an unidentified Russian businessman, the Diari de Tarragona previously reported. Authorities became suspicious of the hotel when a huge laser pointing at the sky was built on its roof. The Catalan police raided the premises in 2018 and found a bitcoin mining farm in the basement of the hotel that was operating 24-7. According to reports, the police lacked the authority to shut down the bitcoin mining operation at the time as cryptocurrency was an unregulated industry. The publication noted that it was unclear what happened to the mining farm. The hotel is now permanently closed.McAfee recently said that the Feds suspected that he had some hidden cryptocurrencies, which he denied, adding that all of his assets had been seized by the Feds.McAfee never said he was at this hotel. However, a group of computer enthusiasts pieced together clues from images and comments he posted online using methodologies, such as open-source intelligence, Spanish publications conveyed.When the cybersecurity mogul said he was hiding out near Belarus, several clues placed him in Spain instead. Some of the images he posted on social media included his photos on beaches and balconies matching images on Google maps of the Daurada Park Hotel.In March, during the coronavirus pandemic, McAfee shared photos of empty supermarkets where prices were in Catalan. He was also spotted earlier with a bottle of Catalan Sumarroca cava wine, Spanish Bezoya water bottles, and ATO cream which was also made there.McAfee eventually admitted that he had been in Catalonia when he “visited Spain for a few days.” However, the group believed that this hotel was his long-term base. “He himself has said that he often came to Catalonia since 2018 or 2019 and it seems that he was based in this hotel,” they said.The antivirus tycoon was arrested on Oct. 3 last year at the El Prat airport in Barcelona as he was planning to fly to Turkey. The next day McAfee was admitted to Brians 2 prison in Sant Esteve de Sesrovires after appearing before Spain’s high court. He was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in March. After the 75-year-old was found hung in his prison cell, speculation about him having a “dead man’s switch” began to circulate.What do you think about John McAfee hiding out at a bitcoin mining farm?

735,CME Group's Micro Bitcoin Futures Reach 1 Million Contracts Traded,"Jun 27, 2021","CME Group’s(Chicago Mercantile Exchange) micro-bitcoin futures have already traded more than one million contracts. This instrument allows institutions and retail traders to invest in the crypto asset at a lower price point of 0.1 bitcoin. The contract has only been available for seven weeks, and demand shows there is still room for new derivatives in the crypto market. When the CME launched a new set of bitcoin derivatives contracts directed to smaller investors almost two months ago, it didn’t expect so much buzz around it. But, according to volume numbers, it seems to have nailed a need in the market for a more granular bitcoin exposure. Now, as more than a million micro-bitcoin futures contracts have changed hands, it’s a big milestone for a very young instrument. That’s an even bigger achievement, considering cryptocurrency is still a niche market.According to Tim McCourt, CME Group’s global head of equity index and alternative investment products, the design of this product is key for its success. He stated:This micro-sized contract is designed to provide market participants – from institutions to smaller, sophisticated, active traders – with another tool to hedge their spot bitcoin price risk or execute bitcoin trading strategies in an efficient, cost-effective, and easily accessible way.The micro bitcoin futures launched back in May and has opened the regulated crypto derivatives market to micro investors. With these contracts, CME addresses two main worries for potential cryptocurrency investors: the high price point entry and the need for regulated instruments.Brokers and investment services have also experienced a sensible demand for micro-bitcoin futures. Martin Franchi, CEO of Ninjatrader Group, declared these contracts have become more popular in the space. Franchi stressed:We have seen the fast rise in popularity of this new micro contract among the Ninjatrader user community correlate with growing demand from cryptocurrency traders interested in the opportunity to diversify and leverage professional tools in their trading.Ninjatrader boasts a community of more than 60,000 customers. Steven Sanders, Executive vice president of marketing and product development at Interactive Brokers, stated at its launch that:This smaller sized contract will enable more of our sophisticated, individual clients to participate in the market, and will allow our institutional clients to more precisely manage their bitcoin exposure.This new pricing strategy might empower new customers to enter more regulated marketplaces like CME. While derivates are still highly concentrated in unregulated platforms, this might change in the future. CME’s micro-bitcoin futures are part of an interesting strategy to achieve that change.What do you think of the popularity of CME’s micro-bitcoin futures? Tell us in the comments section below.

736,"Despite BTC's Price Drop, Bitcoin Held on Exchanges Is 28% Lower Than Last Year","Jun 27, 2021","While the price of bitcoin is more than 40% lower than it was 90 days ago on March 29, the number of bitcoin held on exchanges has also been reduced. Last year on the same day in June, 2.79 million bitcoin was retained on crypto trading platforms and a year later roughly 28.67% of the bitcoin held left crypto exchanges. The decreasing quantity of bitcoin kept on centralized exchanges suggests the coins are being held in long-term storage rather than being prepared for trading.On March 29, 2021, the price was 42.93% higher but there was also 9.54% more bitcoin (BTC) held on centralized exchanges. Moreover, the price of BTC was $9,165 per unit, and today as BTC hovers above $33K per unit the price is 262% higher than last year.Interestingly, there was a whole lot more bitcoin on exchanges on June 26, 2020, with statistics showing 2.79 million bitcoin was held in exchange reserves. Today, bitcoin held on exchanges is 28% lower with data showing 1.99 million bitcoin on centralized trading platforms.Last year, Bitcoin.com News reported on exchange balances dropping a month later on July 30, 2020. At that point in time, there was 2.6 million bitcoin on global exchanges and that metric was a 12 month low which fueled bullish optimism.When bitcoin balances are reduced on centralized exchanges, market participants assume these coins are being held in long-term storage instead of waiting to be sold. Analysts presume that lower selling pressure stems from bitcoin users storing funds in noncustodial private wallets.However, since April 2021, there’s been an increase in bitcoin held on exchanges as April 20 was the lowest point of the year. On that day, data shows that 1.82 million was held on exchanges and since then balances across the board have spiked by 9.34% to 1.99 million BTC or $62 billion worth using today’s exchange rates.So as the price has dropped lower in recent times, there’s been a small bump up in exchange deposits, which balances the 90-day drop from March 29 to now. In March 2020, when ‘Black Thursday’ took place there were more than 3 million BTC held on exchanges.Statistics show the top exchange with the most bitcoin (BTC) on June 27, 2021, is Coinbase with 636,835 BTC or more than $21 billion in bitcoin reserves. 3,550 BTC or over $117 million left Coinbase during the last 30 days according to bybt.com/balance stats.Coinbase is followed by Binance (341,722), Okex (323,552), Bitfinex(187,728), Huobi (156,277), Kraken (144,499), and Bitflyer (61,185). Even though Coinbase saw over 3K in BTC leave the exchange, Huobi saw 23,335 BTC or $774 million exit the trading platform during the last month.Adding stablecoins and ethereum (ETH) into the mix and data from Bituniverse, Peckshield, Chain.info, and Etherscan shows that Coinbase has more than $35 billion in reserves between stables, ETH, and BTC.With those three metrics combined, the reserve positions by exchange data changes, with Binance ($14.9 billion), Huobi ($12.8 billion), Kraken ($8.64 billion), and Okex ($6.33 billion) following respectively. Last year, those crypto balances held in USD value were much lower than today.For example, Coinbase’s reserve value was 61% lower in July 2020 and held around $13.6 billion in value with its stablecoin, ETH, and BTC reserves. Binance’s value of the same combination of reserves was 71.40% lower in USD value. Despite the rise in value, at that time last year, both exchanges had more cryptocurrencies held in reserve.What do you think about the number of bitcoins leaving exchanges? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

737,Africrypt Directors Deny Allegations They Fleeced Clients as Doubts Over Actual Value Missing Bitcoins Grows,"Jun 27, 2021","According to new reports, Raees and Ameer Cajee, the two young directors of the recently collapsed crypto investment firm, Africrypt, have “categorically denied” allegations they fleeced clients. Instead, the brothers insist their company is the victim of a hack while also claiming that the media may be overestimating the value of the missing bitcoins. These fresh denials by Africrypt directors come as doubts over the actual number of stolen bitcoins continue to mount. Responding to an inquiry from BBC, John Oosthuizen, the lawyer representing Cajees suggested that accusations against his clients had no foundation and lacked “merit.” Still, when asked if his clients had made a police report following the hacking incident, Oosthuizen said “no.”Still, the lawyer suggests that his clients, who are thought to be aged 18 and 20, have “very little life experience.” As a result, when they started receiving death threats, their “first reaction was to keep themselves and their families safe.”While Oosthuizen has not revealed the whereabouts of the Cajees, he has, however, said his clients “would co-operate with any future inquiries by the authorities.” Nevertheless, the Cajees would only do this once they have been notified of an investigation, the lawyer explained.Meanwhile, doubts over the exact value of the stolen bitcoins grew after an anonymous Africrypt investor told BBC that while the losses incurred were considerable “they were very much less than the billions that had been reported.”In fact, an archive of Africrypt’s website from Jan 2021 suggests that the investment firm had $100 million under management. This figure is far less than the reported $3.6 billion worth of missing bitcoins suggesting that initial figures were inflated.Do you believe the Cajee brothers’ claims that Africrypt is a victim of a hack?

It is a “Bitcoin focused initiative that aims to demystify and destigmatize mainstream narratives about Bitcoin, explain how institutions can and should embrace it, and raise awareness around areas of the network that need support,” its website details.Dorsey, who will be a featured speaker at the event, tweeted promoting the event on Thursday. “As more companies and institutions get into the mix, we all want to help protect and spread what makes bitcoin open development so perfect. This day is focused on education and actions to do just that,” the Twitter CEO wrote.Musk replied to Dorsey’s tweet: “Bicurious?” The Tesla CEO appeared to be commenting on what “B” stands for in the event’s name. He later tweeted: “Oh right … Bitcoin haha.”Responding to Musk, Dorsey wrote: “Bizarre! Let’s you and I have a conversation at the event. You can share all your curiosities…”Replying to Dorsey’s suggestion of “Let’s have the talk,” Musk agreed and wrote: “For the Bitcurious? Very well then, let’s do it.” Dorsey followed up with: “Done! Will set up.”Many people are excited that Musk will talk about bitcoin with Dorsey, although neither has clarified what the talk will actually be about.Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, who will also be a featured speaker at The B Word event, tweeted:Brilliant. Looking forward to the discussion.Wood and Dorsey have taken the view that bitcoin mining can help the environment while Musk thinks that the activity harms the environment. Wood’s investment company, Ark Invest, and Square have jointly published a report arguing that bitcoin mining is net positive for the environment.Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin in the first quarter and began accepting the cryptocurrency for payments in March. However, Musk said in May that the electric car company had halted accepting BTC citing environmental concerns. He then said that Tesla will begin accepting bitcoin again “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.” However, his requirement may be complicated to verify.Many people have tried to convince Musk that he has been misinformed about the environmental effects of bitcoin, including Shark Tank star Mark Cuban. The owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks explained to Musk that accepting bitcoin is actually good for the environment. The Tesla CEO also talked to North American bitcoin miners with the help of Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor. The miners subsequently set up a bitcoin mining council.How do you think the talk between Musk and Dorsey will turn out? Let us know in the comments section below.

He warns that the price of the cryptocurrency could fall to the $15K level.The chief investment officer (CIO) of Guggenheim Partners, Scott Minerd, is back with another bearish prediction for bitcoin and a forecast of where the “real bottom” of the bitcoin price is.Minerd is also the chairman of Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners. Guggenheim Investments has about $270 billion in total assets under management across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies.He said in an interview with CNBC Friday:The real bottom, when you look at the technicals, $10,000 would be the real bottom. You know, that’s probably a little extreme, so I would say $15,000.This prediction followed his comment Tuesday on Twitter when he wrote: “Look for more declines in crypto as bitcoin breaks through support. Next likely support level is $20,000.”Minerd explained Friday that the recent BTC price rally has been supported by significant “central bank liquidity.” He cautioned that bitcoin’s price will fall as that liquidity fades.The price of bitcoin dipped below the $30K level last week. At the time of writing, BTC stands at $31,583 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.The Guggenheim CIO proceeded to advise that he “wouldn’t be in a hurry” to jump back into bitcoin at $20,000, noting that the cryptocurrency should consolidate sideways for a couple of years before it moves higher. He opined:I don’t think people need to be anxious to be putting money in bitcoin right now.Minerd has made several bearish predictions about the price of bitcoin in the near term. In May, Minerd warned of a massive sell-off in bitcoin after alerting investors to a major BTC correction in April.Despite his short-term bearish forecast, Minerd is bullish about bitcoin in the long run, believing that the price of the cryptocurrency could reach $600,000. “We do a lot of fundamental research. If you consider the supply of bitcoin relative … to the supply of gold in the world … If bitcoin were to go to those kinds of numbers. You’ll be talking about $400K to $600K per bitcoin,” the CIO described.What do you think about Scott Minerd’s bitcoin price prediction? Let us know in the comments section below.

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police officer, is currently in the lead. He led the first round of voting with 31.7% support.

Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang came in fourth with 11.7%.During his election night party speech last week, Adams said:I’m going to promise you.

We are going to be the center of all technology.He added: “Miami, you had your run. We’re bringing our businesses back.”In Florida, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is a bitcoin hodler. He has also been trying to turn his city into a bitcoin hub. He has put forward a proposal to allow the city to pay its employees in bitcoin, accept the cryptocurrency for fees and taxes, and even explore the possibility of holding BTC on its balance sheet.The city recently hosted the Bitcoin 2021 conference and blockchain.com just moved its headquarters there, which “created 300 new jobs and $30 million of recurring economic impact for our city,” Mayor Suarez said at the conference.Another New York City mayoral candidate, Andrew Yang, also wants to turn NYC into a bitcoin hub. He said back in February: “As mayor of NYC — the world’s financial capital — I could invest in making the city a hub for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.”However, the 46-year-old Democrat conceded the race last week. Nonetheless, he could still help the next mayor of NYC with bitcoin adoption as he said: “Though we’re not sure who’s the next mayor is going to be, but whoever that person is, I will be very happy to work with them to improve the lives of the 8.3 million people who live in our great city and I encourage everyone here to do the same.”Do you think New York City will become a bitcoin hub?

So it’s really a piece of history.” Arnold added:So the potential for paying in cryptocurrency for the full hammer price and buyer’s premium was something that felt like this was a perfect marriage.The painting has an estimated value of 3.9 million pounds – 4.5 million pounds ($5.42 million – $6.25 million).Two cryptocurrencies will be accepted. “Payment in ether or bitcoin must be made via a digital wallet transfer of that currency to Christie’s,” the auction house’s website describes, noting that partial payments from multiple digital wallets will not be allowed.However, the digital wallet used must be held with one of the following custodians: Coinbase Custody Trust, Coinbase, Fidelity Digital Assets Services, Gemini Trust Company, Gemini Europe Ltd., Gemini Europe Services Ltd., Paxos Trust Company, Digivault Ltd., Ziglu Ltd., or Archax Ltd.Christie’s emphasized:Only payments sent from digital wallets maintained at these platforms will be credited towards this lot purchase, and we will not recognise payments from digital wallets hosted at other exchanges or self-hosted wallets.What do you think about Christie’s accepting bitcoin?

744,First Bitcoin ETF in Latam Debuts on Brazil Stock Exchange,"Jun 25, 2021","The first Bitcoin ETF in Latin America made its debut yesterday on the Brazil Stock Exchange. Presented by QR Capital, a Brazilian blockchain investment firm, the ETF seeks to simplify Bitcoin exposure for institutions and companies. The ETF was approved by Brazilian regulators and is currently trading with the QBTC11 ticker.The first Bitcoin ETF initiative in Latam is already listed on the Brazilian stock exchange. Conceived by QR Capital, a blockchain investment firm and asset manager, its objective is to simplify Bitcoin access for institutions. This Bitcoin ETF product got its approval last March from the Brazil Securities and Exchange Commission.According to QR Capital CEO Fernando Carvalho, their product is pioneering how companies approach cryptocurrency investments in Brazil. Carvalho stated:We can see the market maturing in its search for safer and simpler bitcoin exposure options. Our bitcoin ETF is a landmark for both financial and crypto markets, once it is the convergence point between them. The Brazilian investor has now a regulated and robust choice to buy bitcoin.While other Bitcoin-based ETFs were launched in Canada, this offering is unique in Latam. The product had a good starting session, with bitcoin prices recovering 7% during initial trading hours. QR’s Bitcoin ETF also features a relatively low administration fee of 0.75% annually, intended to entice small investors into entering the cryptocurrency investment world in regulated fashion.Canada and Brazil are already trading Bitcoin ETFs in their markets. But similar filings in the US haven’t had the same luck. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has repeatedly denied filing after filing from different companies offering similar products. There are currently more than 7 filings from different companies seeking to offer this solution in the US stock market, and two for Ethereum-based variations.The SEC has given several reasons for not greenlighting these proposals. Unregulated markets prone to manipulation and price volatility are a couple. However, Microstrategy and Grayscale have stepped in as a kind of unofficial replacement for these instruments, bringing indirect exposure to the underlying assets.In any case, if a Bitcoin ETF arrives in US markets soon, it could greatly simplify companies’ access to Bitcoin. There are still major hurdles to overcome for institutions wishing to invest in crypto. An ETF would be a major solution for managers that don’t want to complicate things with custody liabilities and want to be protected by current market laws.What do you think about the first Bitcoin ETF product approved in Brazil? Tell us in the comments section below.

We do it this way to give security to the population,” the president explained.Bukele further revealed:It will be within the Chivo app where we will deposit the equivalent $30 in bitcoin to promote its use in the economy and to give people an incentive to use the application.With the $30 incentive in bitcoin, he said, “We want the population to make use of this system and bitcoin as legal tender” to boost the economy and “help the economic growth of the country.”To obtain a DUI (Documento Único de Identidad), which is needed for account verification, one must be at least 18 years old. This means out of El Salvador’s total population of 6.5 million based on Woldometer’s data, only adults ages 18 and older qualify to receive the $30 BTC freebie.The Salvadoran president further detailed that the Chivo app will allow users to convert funds between dollars to bitcoin, make payments, and send money using a QR code. In addition, he said app users can buy BTC “securely, instantly and without charging fees.”He emphasized that using, receiving, and investing in bitcoin in El Salvador is optional, noting that the $30 BTC bonus will be the only time recipients must accept the cryptocurrency. For spending, users can choose to use either bitcoin or dollars if they have both currencies in their wallets.El Salvador’s bitcoin law will enter into force on Sept. 7, Bukele noted. “We will guarantee that all cash transactions will remain in dollars,” he clarified.What do you think about El Salvador giving away $30 in bitcoin to all users of the government crypto wallet?

750,Former NYSE President Says for Bitcoin to Exceed Gold It Needs to Be Accepted More as Currency,"Jun 24, 2021","On June 24, the CEO of Far Peak Acquisition Corp. and former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) president, Thomas Farley discussed the future of bitcoin and gold on the CNBC broadcast Squawk Box. Farley is optimistic about the leading crypto asset but he doesn’t believe it will surpass gold’s $10 trillion market capitalization unless it’s “an accepted form of currency.”Thomas Farley spoke about bitcoin (BTC) on Wednesday following the digital asset’s rebound from the $28,600 low on June 22. Farley is the chief executive officer at Far Peak Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company but he also once led the NYSE as its president.Farley has spoken about bitcoin on a few occasions in the past and was known for revealing the launch of the NYSE bitcoin price index in 2015. “We are now going to use our name, reputation, and global index provider stature to provide bitcoin values that the rest of the market can look to,” Farley said at the time.While speaking on Squawk Box, Farley stressed that BTC was a volatile asset and this is because it is so new. “With respect to the recent price moves, I’m kind of sanguine about them,” Farley remarked. “Bitcoin’s a very volatile asset class, in part because it’s a new asset class,” he emphasized.Farley doesn’t think that BTC won’t go up or even down over the long term, but he still believes “it’s a lower left to upper right trend and I think we’re going to see that play out over five years.”The Far Peak executive, however, believes gold has the upper hand in comparison to bitcoin. “I think the upper bound for now is gold, which is about a $10 trillion market cap,” Farley said.Despite the fact that BTC needs to be more than half of a million dollars per unit, many bitcoin bulls believe the leading crypto asset can surpass gold’s global valuation. It seems that Farley thinks that BTC could get an edge on gold if it was a more accepted medium of exchange. But the former NYSE president is not so sure BTC will ever pull it off.“In order for bitcoin to one day exceed gold, it’ll have to be more of an accepted form of currency,” Farley explained. “I’m not sure, frankly, if it ever gets there.”What do you think about Thomas Farley’s opinions about bitcoin and gold? Do you think bitcoin could someday surpass gold’s market valuation? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

752,Norwegian Financial Regulator Cautions About Bitcoin Investing as Price Tumbles,"Jun 24, 2021","The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (Finanstilsynet) has cautioned investors about investing in cryptocurrencies as the price of bitcoin plunged Tuesday. “There is a strong need for a legal framework and investor protection if cryptocurrency is to be able to become a suitable form of investment for consumers,” the regulator’s consumer coordinator wrote.Norway’s financial regulator, Finanstilsynet, posted a notice on its website Tuesday warning about the risks of investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is written by the regulator’s consumer coordinator, Jo Gjedrem, a lawyer from the Norwegian Consumer Authority, the Finanstilsynet described. The warning was posted as the price of bitcoin dipped below the $30K level Tuesday.Gjedrem began by noting that Norwegian consumers increasingly sought new investments during the coronavirus pandemic and “Cryptocurrency has received the attention that very few other investment options have.” He detailed, “The technology is new and exciting, high-profile investors and celebrities have bought in, and influencers are marketing them on social media.”However, the Finanstilsynet’s consumer coordinator cautioned:Most cryptocurrencies are subject to extreme price fluctuations. The risk of loss is high … The market has also attracted significant criminal activity. Scammers use spam, computer viruses, fake drawings and a variety of other techniques to deceive consumers.He explained that cryptocurrency is largely unregulated in Norway, and there is no statutory consumer protection for cryptocurrency buyers, unlike with traditional investments.Furthermore, Gjedrem emphasized that cryptocurrency trading platforms in Norway are only obligated to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) provisions and the Finanstilsynet does not supervise them beyond that.Gjedrem noted:There is a strong need for a legal framework and investor protection if cryptocurrency is to be able to become a suitable form of investment for consumers.The lawyer pointed out that the European Commission presented a proposal in September 2020 to regulate the cryptocurrency market. The proposed rules, which are expected to be in place in four years, cover various areas, including market abuse, issuer authorization, and investor protection.“Until such regulations are in place, anyone considering trading in cryptocurrency should think carefully and understand the significant risk that such investments entail,” the Finanstilsynet post concludes. “Consumers who want to try this with open eyes should not invest more than they can afford to lose.”What do you think about the Norwegian financial regulator’s warning? Let us know in the comments section below.

754,After Years of ASIC Manufacturing Canaan Expands to Bitcoin Mining in Kazakhstan,"Jun 24, 2021","Canaan Inc., the crypto mining rig manufacturer based in Beijing, has announced the company plans to mine cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan. The company says that the firm’s next-generation Avalonminer mining rigs are already deployed in the world’s largest landlocked country.The publicly-listed company Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) has revealed the firm is entering the fray of bitcoin mining with its own self-operated mining business. Canaan is one of the oldest bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers in the world as it was founded by Nangeng Zhang in 2013.In the company’s earliest years it created FPGA miners dedicated to Bitcoin’s SHA256 consensus algorithm. Fast forward to today and the company is one of the top application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) makers, up there with Bitmain, Microbt, and Ebang.On Wednesday, the Beijing-based company revealed it will be leveraging its Avalonminers to mine bitcoin in Kazakhstan. The move follows the firm opening up an ASIC mining rig service center in the transcontinental country.The announcement on Wednesday explains that the move to start mining bitcoin after expanding the company’s manufacturing process is “the next logical step.” The entry into the field of mining will “optimize its revenues, as well as strengthen its inventory management and supply chain capabilities,” the company states.“We believe that our self-operated bitcoin mining business will help us improve our financial performance as well as expand our business scope and customer base,” Canaan’s founder Zhang stated during the announcement. “As we integrate more industry resources into our operations, we believe this business segment will enable us to revitalize our mining machine inventory, shield us from bitcoin volatility, and ensure our inventory sufficiency during market upturns.”A few of Canaan’s manufacturing competitors have been in the mining space for years, specifically Bitmain. The China-based mining rig company Bitmain has been operating a pool called Antpool since 2013. Today, Bitmain’s Antpool is one of the largest pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain.Canaan says it will also benefit from taking full advantage of the availability of its “in-stock mining machines to be actively deployed in its mining operations at low electricity rates, thus maximising its computing power at that time.”“On the flip side,” Canaan concluded, “when market activity is elevated, the mining business will also benefit from putting the processing capacity of older machines in use. The net result will be a considerable improvement in inventory planning and supply chain optimization throughout the year and unaffected by the price of bitcoin.” Canaan added:Finally, the venture into Bitcoin mining allows Canaan to directly accumulate bitcoin which is now widely accepted as an investable asset class, and thus has the potential for considerable upside for Canaan.What do you think about Canaan’s entry into the field of bitcoin mining after manufacturing mining rigs since 2013?

756,Mike Novogratz: Institutional Investors Will See Bitcoin's Price Decline as Opportunity to Buy,"Jun 23, 2021","Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz says he is not nervous about bitcoin’s price falling, even when it falls below $30K. “The ecosystem is so much more mature. The amount of players that are moving in are so much more mature. Every single bank is working on their own crypto project,” he said.Mike Novogratz commented on the bitcoin market Tuesday in an interview with CNBC as the price of the cryptocurrency fell below $30K. Commenting on the falling BTC price, Novogratz said:If it’s really breached, $25,000 is the next big level of support … I’m less happy than I was at $60,000, but I’m not nervous.The Galaxy Digital CEO opined: “We had China really be much more forceful in their idea to ban cryptocurrency. That’s created a retail deleveraging. A lot of crypto happens in Asia, a lot of it is Chinese focused. So we’re seeing big liquidations, so it’s hard to call a bottom.”Novogratz believes that the Chinese government’s crackdown is a long-term positive for bitcoin. “Maybe not in the short run, but it’s a good thing. That’s what’s created this excessive volatility that we’ve seen,” he detailed.Recently, Facebook’s head of payments and the Diem crypto project, David Marcus, also said that China cracking down on bitcoin mining is “a great development” for bitcoin. Many people agreed with him on Twitter.Overall, Novogratz does not expect bitcoin to suffer a massive crash, elaborating:The ecosystem is so much more mature. The amount of players that are moving in are so much more mature. Every single bank is working on their own crypto project, how they can get bitcoin to their wealth clients.“I think a lot of clients that didn’t buy it the first time will see this [the low price level] as an opportunity to buy it and get involved,” he concluded.What do you think about Mike Novogratz’s comments about bitcoin?

757,"Bitcoin's Hashrate Drops Below 100 Exahash, Observers Describe China's 'Great ASIC Exodus'","Jun 23, 2021","Most of the crypto community has been focused on the developments in China and more specifically, the crackdowns against bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan. On Wednesday morning (EST), Bitcoin’s overall hashrate has continued to drop and is now below the 100 exahash per second (EH/s) region. During the last 24 hours, people acquainted with Chinese miners have been describing the latest hardships bitcoin miners are facing.Notices stemming from government officials in five Chinese provinces noted that bitcoin mining operations must cease immediately and this has caused a lot of anxiety among some bitcoiners in recent times. On Tuesday, June 22, Bitcoin.com News reported on the hashrate shifts and how mystery hashrate and stealth mining has started to increase following the crackdowns. Bitcoin.com News also explained last week how it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact quantity of hashrate that resides in mainland China.The community can see that the hashrate is now below 100 EH/s and has lost between 15-25% since the Sichuan crackdown. Meanwhile, residents of the western hemisphere have been in the dark in regard to how much hashrate is actually in China, and where mining operations are relocating. However, the regional reporters at 8btc have described some of the events taking place in China, alongside Foundry Digital’s executive Kevin Zhang.“Chinese miners are not familiar with the overseas environment, and moving overseas is destined to be a long process,” 8btc disclosed on Tuesday in a Twitter thread. 8btc’s thread stems from translated commentary from a miner dealing with the crackdown situation. “Today, a mining industry insider posted that Chinese miners actually tried to ‘move overseas’ a few years ago, but it turned out that the overall domestic cost is still the lowest,” 8btc continued.“Specifically, bare electricity in Canada and the U.S. is mostly at 0.3 cents, but construction + labor + operation and maintenance + taxation, and various environmental protection standards, have long cycles and high costs,” the regional report translated by 8btc details. “Electricity prices are cheap in the Far East, but miners are worried about the instability of the local situation. Georgia and Kazakhstan have electricity, but the process is sometimes the same as Vietnam and India.”The translated account from China further says that the temperatures in Malaysia and Thailand are too high. Moreover in Africa and Iran, Chinese miners have seen advertisements to set up shop there, but no one knows “who actually went there.”“At the same time, Fenghua International Express disclosed that it had airlifted a batch of bitcoin miners to Maryland, USA,” the thread further added. “It is reported that this is only the ‘vanguard’ in the army of bitcoin miners that China has shut down, accounting for a very low proportion.”8btc’s thread concluded by stressing: “Luckily, we now have passionate people like [Arman Batayev] from Astana Financial Innovation Centre and [Guy Deriq] from Uganda [who] can help Chinese miners move abroad. Would love to see more people like this coming out.”In addition to the 8btc thread, the vice president of business development at Foundry Digital, Kevin Zhang described the issues his “mining colleagues in China” are seeing.“Sentiment is obviously quite dreary and the reality is setting in that it’s GG for mining in China. Some mining friends have stuck around Sichuan since the Bitmain conference to drink their sorrows away. Now… 酒都不想喝了 – ‘not even in the mood to drink anymore,’” Zhang said on Wednesday. “They estimate that roughly 70% of the bitcoin mining capacity in China has gone offline and by the end of this month, it’ll be closer to 90% offline,” he added.Zhang said that in extreme cases some colleagues in Kangding, Sichuan were instructed by “power plants/stations” to remove all the infrastructure including containers, racks, and shelving. With just 1-2 weeks’ notice, Zhang remarked that moving all of this infrastructure is a pain and “especially considering most of the operations (especially the larger ones) received the proper assurances and permitting to run their operations.”“Before resellers and opportunists get way too ahead of themselves for scooping up discounted electrical equipment,” Zhang further emphasized. “They should consider that most of the gear won’t be up to code for established Western countries (not UL Listed or CE Certified, aluminum transformers vs copper).” The mining executive continued:Which leads to my next point that the ‘Great ASIC Exodus’ will be anything but seamless… Hosting capacity outside China was already oversubscribed and scarce prior to these regulatory announcements. Additionally, expectations for hosting terms are greatly MISALIGNED.9) Chinese miners have been quick to mobilize… one colleague sent some technicians down to Shenzhen, to focus on 2nd hand miner testing, repair, cleaning, and repackaging for exportation. He has cleaned and shipped out over 20,000 ASIC’s in the last 2 weeks pic.twitter.com/92pAynQigl— Kevin Zhang (@SinoCrypto) June 23, 2021Zhang gave a number of examples of misalignment like hosting costs are more expensive internationally, there’s long lead times, required deposits, and the tariffs between the U.S. and China. The Foundry Digital executive explained that not all Chinese miners were “caught with their pants down.” He stressed that some have already been gradually expanding internationally.“This process only accelerated with the Inner Mongolia ban earlier this year,” Zhang noted. The Foundry representative concluded:This isn’t the end. Whatever doesn’t kill bitcoin, will make it stronger. I was chuckling with some colleagues earlier because we are still so early… The MSM was chomping at the bit to report 6,600 lbs of ASICs being shipped. That’s a little over 200 ASICs.What do you think about the ‘Great ASIC Exodus’ taking place in China? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The senator believes bitcoin is a great store of value.U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming commented on the falling price of bitcoin on Tuesday in an interview with Fox Business. She was asked how she felt about bitcoin’s price falling to below $30K. The senator replied:I’m really excited about it because as soon as it drops a little more I’m going to buy some more.She then shared a story of another investment she made previously. “My favorite stock that I own is a company called United Rentals. I bought it and it dropped like a rock. I held onto it and … it has performed beautifully over the years for me. And I see bitcoin doing the same kind of thing because the fundamentals are good.”Senator Lummis was also asked if she wanted any kind of regulation for bitcoin. “I do,” she affirmed. “I want to have a level playing field.” She elaborated that the rules should be simple and easy to understand for digital assets and cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that they should not be “overly restrictive because we want to see increased innovation in this space.”Lummis revealed last year that she is a bitcoin holder and has been saying that the cryptocurrency is a great store of value. “I was struck by how innovative bitcoin is with its decentralized public ledger and a fixed supply,” she explained at the time.The senator plans to convince her colleagues in Congress about the benefits of bitcoin. “I want to make sure everybody understands that this is a great store of value,” she previously said.Senator Lummis is not the only one who plans to take advantage of the falling price of bitcoin and buy the dip. Microstrategy just purchased 13,005 bitcoins and Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki recently revealed that he is waiting for the BTC price to fall to $24K to buy some more coins.What do you think about Senator Cynthia Lummis’ comments about bitcoin and her plan to buy the dip?

759,While Bitcoin Hits New Lows Gold Bug Peter Schiff Blasts the Top Crypto and Supporters,"Jun 23, 2021","The American economist, financial commentator, and gold bug Peter Schiff had a lot to say about bitcoin’s price sliding on Tuesday. Schiff has always claimed bitcoin’s value will one day drop to nothing. This week he insists bitcoin’s chart shows a head and shoulders top pattern with a “neckline around $30K the pattern measures a move to zero.”After bitcoin (BTC) dropped 10% Monday during the overnight and into the morning sessions on Tuesday, Peter Schiff took to his soapbox on Twitter and hammered the leading crypto asset. Schiff often has nothing good to say about bitcoin but on Tuesday, a great majority of his tweets (close to ten in total) were dedicated to bitcoin. The financial commentator talked about his favorite investment, gold, as well, and discussed how the precious metal dipped 6% last week.“Over the weekend bitcoin bugs made fun of gold’s 6% drop last week, which was about twice bitcoin’s 3% decline,” Schiff said. “But while gold recovered some of those losses today, bitcoin crashed by another 9%. Also, while gold is down 9% from its 2021 high, bitcoin is down a whopping 50%,” he added.Schiff’s tweets even targeted bitcoin bulls like Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor and Digital Currency Group’s Barry Silbert. Schiff tweeted:If you really want to buy bitcoin, wait until Microstrategy sells its last satoshi. If MSTR keeps selling stock and borrowing money to buy into a falling market, existing or new shareholders will be forced to liquidate. [Michael Saylor’s] diamond hands are really made of glass.One individual defended Microstrategy’s CEO and told Schiff to debate Saylor or stop criticizing a “technology that you don’t understand.” Others stated in the Twitter thread that Schiff has already offered to debate Saylor, but the Microstrategy executive allegedly “has not taken him up on it.”In another tweet on Tuesday, Schiff went after Digital Currency Group’s CEO Barry Silbert. “In Mar. [Barry Silbert] promised GBTC investors he’d close the 10% discount to NAV by buying back $250 million of shares,” Schiff wrote. “And then in early May he promised to increase the buy to $750 million. So far he’s purchased less than a third of that amount. What are you waiting for Barry?” Schiff asked the Digital Currency Group executive.Then the gold bug went after billionaire investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.“As bitcoin crashed below $30K, CNBC invited [Mike Novogratz] to try to pump it back up,” Schiff remarked after his many anti-bitcoin tweet bombs on Tuesday. “Novogratz claims Bitcoin can’t keep falling as there is all this new institutional demand. Assuming some institutions were getting interested above $60K, I’m sure they’ve lost interest below $30K.”Of course, Schiff’s son Spencer Schiff got in on the action after his father tweeted about bitcoin doing a dead cat bounce.“Don’t get excited about bitcoin’s dead cat bounce from an intra-day low of around $28.6K to near $32K,” Schiff’s tweet scathed on Tuesday. “Nothing drops in a straight line, [especially] a token as highly manipulated as bitcoin. As this bear market grinds on, about 55% so far, better to sell the rips than buy the dips,” the economist added. Spencer, however, snarkily snapped back at his father and said:The Bitcoin forecasting wizard has spoken.However, in terms of likes and retweet ratio, Spencer’s father had more likes and retweets. Others defended Spencer Schiff’s statement and said that Peter has been “spectacularly wrong about Bitcoin multiple times over a decade. If he’s right this time it will be purely a broken clock situation.”Besides the dead cat bounce commentary, Schiff also described an alleged head and shoulders pattern in the BTC/USD chart. As usual, Schiff declared that the leading crypto asset’s fiat value was on its way to zero.“The most ominous thing about bitcoin’s head and shoulders top pattern is that with a head near $65K and a neckline around $30K the pattern measures a move to zero,” Schiff wrote. “That’s because the pattern projects a move below the next line that equals the move from the neckline to the head.”“Funny how you’ll apply low probability TA (technical analysis) to BTC, but you won’t even consider the annualized returns of bitcoin over the last 10 years,” an individual responded to Schiff’s head and shoulders tweet. What do you think about Peter Schiff’s bitcoin commentary on Tuesday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

760,Waste Coal-Converting Bitcoin Miner Stronghold Digital Mining Raises $100 Million,"Jun 23, 2021","On Tuesday, Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc., an ESG-friendly cryptocurrency miner announced it has raised $105 million in two private equity securities funding rounds. Stronghold’s operations convert waste coal into alternative energy in order to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.While many have been focused on the environmental concerns stemming from outdated reports and maps, a number of ESG-friendly cryptocurrency mining firms have been making moves in the industry. Stronghold Digital Mining is a Pennsylvania-based operation that leverages waste coal to power digital currency miners.In Pennsylvania and many other regions around the world waste coal and acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the largest sources of pollution. Because precipitation combines with coal waste, the AMD can pollute nearby waterways and threaten aquatic life. Stronghold’s main operation site located at the Scrubgrass Generating Plant in Pennsylvania takes the waste coal and uses it to not only mine cryptos like BTC, but it also donates the cleaned-up land back to local communities.Stronghold will use the newly acquired funds to continue expanding as it expects to have roughly “28,000 cryptocurrency miners operating by year-end.” The mining firm is also partnered with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and so far stats show Stronghold has “reclaimed 1,000 acres of once-unusable land in Pennsylvania.” Stronghold’s announcement details the firm is in the midst of “negotiations to acquire additional environmentally beneficial facilities” with around 200 megawatts of power.Greg Beard, the CEO and co-chairman of Stronghold believes the venture makes the company’s mining model adaptable to ESG-friendly policy. The company’s announcement says the firm estimates it would take roughly 30 years to reclaim all the waste just in the near proximity of the Scrubgrass Generating Plant. “For each bitcoin mined by the company, an estimated 200 tons of waste coal is eliminated,” the company claims.“A negative impact on the environment has long been a criticism of Bitcoin mining, with good reason. Our ownership of the Scrubgrass Plant combined with the environmental benefits which accrue to the region allow us to mine Bitcoin at what we believe to be some of the lowest costs in the industry while making a transformational contribution to the environment. Our vertically integrated model ensures we’re entirely self-sufficient and adaptable” Stronghold’s CEO said in a statement.Meanwhile, other mining operations like EZ Blockchain, Upstream Data, and Crusoe Energy Systems are reducing emissions by mining bitcoin with flare gas. EZ Blockchain recently detailed that the company has partnered with Silver Energy, an oil and gas provider based in Texas.What do you think about Stronghold raising $100 million and how the company converts waste coal into bitcoin?

761,Vaneck Files Prospectus With US Regulator to Launch a Bitcoin Mutual Fund,"Jun 22, 2021","On June 21, the wealth manager Vaneck filed a prospectus to launch what it calls a Bitcoin Strategy Fund. The prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) explains the fund will procure bitcoin exchange-traded products and futures. While the fund manager Vaneck waits to hear a decision about its exchange-traded fund (ETF) registration, the company applied with the SEC to release a mutual fund for investors who want exposure to bitcoin. The registration filed on June 21, also notes that in addition to the Fund’s bitcoin-related investments, “the fund expects to have significant holdings of cash and fixed-income investments.”Vaneck will invest in bitcoin futures contracts, leverage the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), and also “invest in pooled investment vehicles that invest directly or indirectly in bitcoin.” The crypto mutual fund will be dubbed the “Bitcoin Strategy Fund” and the fund’s “share price and return will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the fund’s portfolio securities.”The fund Vaneck discusses in its prospectus will not procure bitcoin (BTC) directly and of course, the prospectus filing mentions the risks involved with cryptocurrency markets. “The value of bitcoin and, therefore, of the fund’s bitcoin-related investments, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment,” the Vaneck filing warns.Vaneck further details that the fund’s risks are not solely tied to the volatility of bitcoin prices as the fund comes with other risks as well. The wealth manager’s registration form with the SEC mentions the risks involved with pooled investment vehicles, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, tracking errors, credit issues, and interest rate discrepancies as well.Meanwhile, Vaneck has been making moves in Europe with its exchange-traded products and the wealth manager is also looking to launch an ethereum-based ETF. Vaneck’s proposed ethereum ETF filing is aiming for a Cboe BZX listing. The company’s bitcoin (BTC)-based ETF filed back in December 2020, has so far been delayed twice by the SEC as far as the regulator’s decision is concerned.What do you think about Vaneck applying with the SEC to launch a bitcoin mutual fund that invests in bitcoin futures and pooled investments?

762,Salvadoran Representative Introduces Lawsuit Against the Bitcoin Tender Law for Being Unconstitutional,"Jun 22, 2021","Jaime Guevara, a Salvadoran representative, presented a lawsuit against the recently approved bitcoin tender law today. Guevara alleges the law is unconstitutional and brings a series of changes that will cause problems for Salvadorans. Some people suspect Bukele’s regime is behind the representative’s demand due to its inability to applying this novel law.Jaime Guevara, a Salvadoran opposition representant, introduced a demand to deem the recently approved bitcoin tender law as unconstitutional. Óscar Artero, a co-signer of the lawsuit, agrees with this interpretation and expects the court to repeal the law. According to him, the bitcoin law doesn’t have a legal base to stand on. Artero declared to local media that:The bitcoin law is to loot people’s pockets, it is tax-exempt, they want to force us to trade.The representative introduced this lawsuit before the presentation of the regulation that derives from the approbation of the law. Consequently, no one currently knows the fine print of the implementation of the exchanging systems.According to a poll made by Camarasal, eight out of ten citizens would not receive payments in bitcoin. Therefore, for most Salvadorans, the bitcoin tender law is a source of concern these days. However, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court would revoke the law because Nayib Bukele appointed these judges after ousting the old ones last May. This was considered by some in the international community as a coup.For Guevara, this will be a test of how independent from the government these judges are. The representative stated:“We are going to put this chamber to the test to see what response they are going to give to the public.”According to other experts, this might be an inside job to free Bukele from the responsibilities of actually implementing this law. This is what Salvador Anaya, a Salvadoran lawyer, thinks. Anaya stated the government is clueless about how to implement this law, and they would be using Guevara and the new judges to save face.But Guevara denied these claims, stating he has nothing to do with New Idea, the ruling party. He stressed:It is widely rumored that this servant represents the interests of Nayib Bukele or the majority bank of New Ideas. At no time, categorically, are we representing the interests of this sector, we are simply representing the people.What do you think about the lawsuit against the Bitcoin Law approved in el Salvador?

763,"As China Cracks Down on Bitcoin Miners, Stealth Miners and Mystery Hashrate Return","Jun 22, 2021","While on the surface it seems officials from five provinces in China have been cracking down on bitcoin miners, no one is quite sure how much hashrate is moving, which pools are affected, or where these miners will end up. A number of mining pools have seen hashpower percentages decline and Bitcoin’s overall hashrate has regressed as well. On the other hand, as several known pools have lost hashrate, processing power from “unknown” pools has increased a great deal.There have been reports stemming from officials in provinces like Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan instructing bitcoin miners to close down shop. The crypto community, in general, assumes that a great deal of hashrate comes from China, but exactly how much hashpower actually resides in the country is still a mystery. Reporting is scarce when it comes to bitcoin mining operations and the most recent studies are outdated.Hashrate distribution shows known pools that have disclosed their identity have seen recent hashpower losses. On June 2, 2021, the Bitcoin (BTC) network hashrate was around 191 exahash per second (EH/s) and today, it’s hovering just above the 100 EH/s zone. The metric has dipped on a few occasions lower than 100 EH/s, but has remained fairly consistent at that level since June 19. Pools that have seen hashrates slide significantly include operations like Okex pool, Binance pool, and Huobi pool.Interestingly, pools like Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, Poolin, and Btc.com have seen wild fluctuations in terms of hashrate but remain the top five mining pools worldwide. Antpool and Viabtc, which are considered ‘Chinese pools,’ command the most SHA256 hashrate globally as well, of all the chains using the SHA256 consensus algorithm. On the BTC chain, the top five mining pools today have been the top miners for months on end in 2021, with a few pools changing positions every now and then.Since the initial warnings coming first from Inner Mongolia during the first week of March 2021, stealth mining has increased a great deal. Mystery miners — engaged in stealth mining — have been prevalent since the Bitcoin network first launched. Basically, if one was to look at the BTC hashrate distribution today, they would notice 18 pools that disclose their identity.But there’s another chunk of hashrate that is dubbed “unknown” on Btc.com’s hashrate distribution charts and other hashrate aggregation/distribution websites. Since China started cracking down on bitcoin miners, the mystery hashrate — which is the seventh-largest mining pool today — has increased a great deal. Statistics show that stealth mining pools are finding a lot more blocks since March 2021, and unknown hash has increased every month thereafter.Unknown hashrate commands around 10 EH/s of BTC hashpower today and over 12% of the overall SHA256 hashrate processing blocks on BTC, BCH, and BSV chains. The crypto community understands that mining operations that want to remain unidentified leverage virtual private networks (VPNs) or proxy services to hide their IP addresses. Mystery hash was very prevalent in 2018 and 2019, but subsided a great deal in 2020. In January 2019, mystery hash commanded 22% of the BTC chain and 17% of the BCH chain. At the time, Coin Metrics published a study on the mystery hash phenomenon.Coinmetrics detailed that between mid-2015 and mid-2017, most miners disclosed their identity through the coinbase parameter to identify themselves with the name of their pool. “However, through 2018, unknown miners picked up,” Coin Metrics said, and stressed stats had shown “a newly-found appreciation for privacy, or the emergence of miners who have something to hide.”But toward the end of 2019 and throughout most of 2020, unknown hashrate was almost nonexistent. That trend has changed a great deal in 2021, and unknown hashrate has returned, coincidentally as Beijing wants to crack down on bitcoin mining and crypto trading in China. There’s likely a reason there’s a new emergence of bitcoin miners this year who have something to hide.What do you think about the return of mystery hashrate after China started cracking down on bitcoin miners in the country? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

765,"Crypto Bears Claw Markets Lower, Bitcoin Price Drops Below $30K, Analysts Still Optimistic","Jun 22, 2021","The price of bitcoin dropped to a new low in 2021, hitting $28,600 per unit Tuesday morning (EST). BTC has shed more than 10% in value over the last 24 hours and its market capitalization is now less than $600 billion.Cryptocurrency markets have seen better days as the entire market capitalization of all 9,000+ crypto assets is down 12% at just above $1.2 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) has shed 26.31% during the last seven days and 42% over the last 90 days.At the time of publication, BTC rests just below the $30K handle in the $29K region. The value had plummeted to $28,600 per unit Tuesday morning.Statistics show that bitcoin’s top trading pair on Tuesday is tether (USDT) which captures 48% of all BTC trades. This is followed by the USD (17.28%), BUSD (7.87%), EUR (5.05%), and JPY (4.80%).Bitcoin (BTC) dominance among all 9,000+ coins is around 46.9% while ethereum (ETH) commands 17.4% of the entire $1.2 trillion crypto market valuation.Ethereum is down 13% on Tuesday and currently trades for $1,742 per unit. ETH has lost a whopping 29.40% over the last seven days.One of the only seven-day gainers this week is mir coin (MIR) which has gained 16.2% during the last week.In a note to Bitcoin.com News on Tuesday, Alex Siman, founder at Subsocial said: “At this rate of fall, it’s difficult to predict the level at which the price will form a baseline for an imminent rebound, as big investors with the potential to reverse prices are choosing to watch from the sideline. While we can still see a positive dynamic before the end of this year, to me, steeper plunges to $20,000 won’t come as a surprise either.”Stephen Kelso, Head of Markets, ITI Capital also commented: “Bitcoin is currently trading approximately one-third below its long-term exponential trend-line, a phenomenon it has only exhibited for c.20% of the time. Given the market forces and demand for scarcity assets to protect wealth, ITI believes this is an attractive buying opportunity for investors.”Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange also sent a note to Bitcoin.com News this week. “We believe that there is not much downside for BTC in the short term as we trade near the bottom end of the $30,000-$42,000 trading range. In the short term the macro environment does not look weak with broader markets continuing to rally and U.S. tech stocks posting all-time weekly highs.“We expect BTC to bounce from here and challenge the $40,000 mark again in the coming weeks. $30,000 is the key level for traders to watch – should we concede 30,000; the sentiment will take a massive hit,” Balani further added. “A conclusive breakdown below $30K might be coupled with heavy selling activity in BTC and the entire crypto market.”What do you think about the recent crypto price action this week?

767,"Hedgeye: This Model Predicts Bitcoin at $1,000,000","Jun 22, 2021","Analysts at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research and financial media company based in Stamford, Connecticut, have analyzed the Bitcoin stock-to-flow argument. This framework suggests Bitcoin’s price potentially reaching $1 million by the latter half of 2020s, and as much as $10 million per BTC by the 2030s. “First they ignore you, Then they laugh at you, Then they fight you, Then you win” -Mahatma GandhiAt its recent peak, Bitcoin’s market cap hit $1.2 trillion. To give you some perspective, that’s bigger than the four largest banks in the United States combined (JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo), as well as the four largest payments platforms combined (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square). As most long-term holders understand, a confluence of critical factors will continue to aid in the proliferation of crypto adoption across the world.Among them:The list goes on and on.
Analysts at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research and financial media company based in Stamford, Connecticut, have analyzed the Bitcoin stock-to-flow argument – in line with their approach of observing financial markets through a quantitative lens (which is noticeably devoid of qualitative, narrative-based “calls”). This framework suggests Bitcoin’s price potentially reaching $1 million by the latter half of 2020s, and as much as $10 million per BTC by the 2030s. Hedgeye was founded in 2008 by former buy-side analysts to democratize access to hedge-fund quality investment research for everyday investors. In an effort to expand the scope of its research process, Hedgeye’s Macro team created an exhaustive, daily quantitative dashboard on a range of cryptocurrencies and ETFs, aptly named the “Bitcoin Trend Tracker”. This “Crypto Quant” dashboard breaks down the 1) Price 2) Volume, and 3) Volatility among several other metrics of each asset it tracks. (You can watch Hedgeye Macro analyst Christian Drake’s 30-minute explainer video on how to use the Tracker here).  The goal is simple: Give investors the same high-quality quantitative data for cryptocurrencies available for other asset classes, reflective of the reality that crypto is here to stay. The “Bitcoin Trend Tracker” is no different from Hedgeye’s other proprietary tools which utilize market-based signaling to stay ahead of large movements in any asset.In addition, one of Hedgeye’s analysts, Josh Steiner, has also performed a fundamental analysis by comparing the Stock-to-Flow model of Bitcoin to that of other hard assets and comparing the evolution of Bitcoin’s price to that Stock-to-Flow framework. Below is a summary of that analysis. To be clear, it should go without saying that numerous, legitimate risks exist to being long Bitcoin. Smart investors need to be mindful of these risks. They run the gamut and include potential regulatory risk, as well as competitive and technological risk. Anyone who owns Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency for that matter) needs to be mindful of these potential land mines and risk manage them accordingly.(You can access the slides featured in this article here)“The idea here is a simple one,” Steiner explains. “If you look at the ratio of outstanding supply relative to the flow rate of that supply, you can get the stock-to-flow ratio. Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow ratio is currently 54x; roughly 344,000 BTC are being mined annually on an outstanding base of about 18.6 million BTC. But what’s remarkable about Bitcoin is that it possesses a pre-programmed creation-decline roughly every ~4 years; during each of these events, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. That means the Stock-to-Flow ratio is poised to increase logarithmically, roughly 10-fold, every 12 years.To put that in perspective, by 2036 we should be at a Stock-to-Flow ratio of approximately 1000x – or more than 10x the stock-to-flow of Housing (93x) or Gold (72x). By 2048, there will be another 10-fold increase, which would take the Stock-to-Flow up to 10,000x.”In plain English, Bitcoin is mathematically designed to exponentially increase its Stock-to-Flow ratio until it ultimately mathematically converges toward infinity. This is both relative to its current state, and relative to other hard-money assets like Housing and Gold. A higher Stock-to-Flow ratio indicates that less new supply is entering the market relative to an asset’s existing, outstanding supply. In other words, an asset with a higher Stock to Flow ratio should, relative to other assets, retain its value better over the long-term. In a world of easy money and U.S. Dollar debasement, it’s easy to understand Bitcoin’s appeal as not just a hard-money asset, but as an ultra-hard-money asset. Unlike real estate and gold, which have high, but relatively static, Stock-to-Flow multiples, Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow ratio will keep increasing exponentially for the next 100+ years.Steiner circles back to the abiding issue mentioned earlier, the impact on price.In the chart below, Steiner plots a time-series of Bitcoin’s price (y-axis) versus the Stock-to-Flow ratio as it changes over time (x-axis) out through 2057. Perhaps most importantly, the black dots in the right-hand chart reflect Bitcoin’s historical price versus the theoretical progression implied by the Stock-to-Flow ratio… and it has followed the model very closely thus far. With over two decades of investing analysis under his belt, Steiner used every regression analysis in the book to model Bitcoin’s future price. The best fit—by far—was a power function. The graphs shown are logarithmic; Bitcoin’s price appreciation has been—and may continue to be—logarithmic. “Every 10-fold increase in Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow ratio, which will happen every ~12 years going forward, has produced a ~1,000-fold increase in Bitcoin’s price. And that hasn’t happened once, but twice.”Steiner explains that he has yet to see another asset behave this way, even after a multi-decade career on both the buyside and sell-side of Wall Street covering Financials, Housing, and Macro.In the spirit of full transparency, Steiner isn’t keeping his model a secret. The equation for the theoretical progression of Bitcoin’s price (relative to its Stock-to-Flow) is y=1.3268x2.4769.That equation forecasts Bitcoin to hit $1 million by the latter half of 2020s, and $10 million per BTC by the late 2030s. Of course, Stock-to-Flow is not the only factor that will influence cryptocurrency prices going forward. The goal of the model is to prove how Bitcoin intrinsically could achieve these price levels. Furthermore, not everyone plans to be a long-term holder of cryptocurrencies. Many people use crypto in various transactions, or to store value but later realize a gain, among numerous other use-cases.Hedgeye’s aim is to add a quantitative framework for investing in cryptocurrencies, for both short-duration traders and long-duration investors alike. Investors can now gain a better understanding of the short-term and long-term movements and correlations that alter the near-term trajectory for various cryptocurrencies and crypto-related ETFs. In other words, Hedgeye is injecting transparency into what will presumably be a massive asset class which one day could rival equities, fixed income and foreign exchange.The Bitcoin Trend Tracker does exactly that. As a risk management tool, it focuses on the Price, Volume, Volatility, and correlative characteristics of each asset it tracks. Managed by the Hedgeye Macro team, it continues to evolve based on new models they develop, subscriber feedback, and innovations within crypto. Hedgeye’s Bitcoin Trend Tracker includes Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough’s proprietary, buy low, sell high Risk Ranges for Bitcoin, Ethereum, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Microstrategy (MSTR)… in addition to other critical crypto quantitative risk management data you can’t get anywhere else.Recently, Hedgeye expanded its crypto coverage with proprietary Risk Ranges for the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK).BOTTOM LINE: You can now get access to critical crypto risk management signals with the “Bitcoin Trend Tracker.”Get more info on Hedgeye’s Bitcoin Trend Tracker here.Learn more about Hedgeye’s overall investment research process here.This is a sponsored post.

768,Facebook's David Marcus: China's Bitcoin Mining Crackdown 'Great Development' for BTC,"Jun 21, 2021","David Marcus, head of Facebook Financial (F2) who is in charge of crypto project Diem, formerly Libra, believes that the Chinese government cracking down on bitcoin mining is “a great development” for the cryptocurrency. Many people in the crypto space agree with him.David Marcus, head of F2 (Facebook Financial), has shared his view on the Chinese government cracking down on bitcoin mining. F2 includes Facebook Pay, Novi, and all payments and financial services efforts by the social media giant. Marcus is also a co-creator and board member of the crypto project Diem, formerly Libra.He tweeted Monday: “How is more bitcoin mining power moving to the United States and the West a bad thing? IMO China cracking down on mining is a great development for BTC.”Many people agree with Marcus, sharing their opinions on Twitter. Several of them agree that the move may seem bearish in the short term but is good for bitcoin in the long run.The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Luno, Marcus Swanepoel, commented: “Familiar pattern for anything Bitcoin: 1 potential issue identified (AML, scaling, Chinese miner concentration, etc), 2 solutions created (Chainalysis, lightening, Chinese ban mining), 3 risk mitigation incorrectly interpreted as increase in risk, 4 eventually penny drops = [Rocket emoji].”Sharan Nair, chief business officer of Indian crypto exchange Coinswitch Kuber, opined:I totally love it how every supposed move to bring down bitcoin actually works in its favor. Perhaps what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger has never been more truer.Following the Chinese government shutting down bitcoin mining farms, miners are reportedly moving their operations out of China. Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter was quoted by CNBC as saying:Chinese miners or miners that were domiciled in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and Northern Europe … Every Western mining host I know has had their phones ringing off the hook.Brandon Arvanaghi, a bitcoin mining engineer and former Gemini security engineer, said: “You are going to see a dramatic shift over the next few months.” He added that Texas could be one of the U.S. states where bitcoin miners will move to. “We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible,” he opined.Florida is another U.S. state that may draw crypto miners. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is trying to attract miners to his city, which he aims to build into a bitcoin hub. Noting that Florida has a great abundance of nuclear power, the pro-bitcoin mayor stated, “The fact that we have nuclear power means that it’s very inexpensive power.”Do you agree with David Marcus that China cracking down on bitcoin mining is a great development for BTC?

769,Mad Money's Jim Cramer Dumps His Bitcoin Over China Mining Crackdown and Ransomware Concerns,"Jun 21, 2021","Mad Money host Jim Cramer said he has sold almost all of his bitcoin. He cited the Chinese government’s crackdown on bitcoin mining and concerns over bitcoin’s role in ransomware attacks.The host of CNBC’s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, revealed Monday that he has sold almost all of his bitcoin. A former hedge fund manager, Cramer co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website.Citing the Chinese government’s bitcoin mining crackdown and the cryptocurrency’s role in ransomware attacks, Cramer said:Sold almost all of my bitcoin. Don’t need it.Cramer got into bitcoin towards the end of last year in fear of massive inflation. In March this year, he said gold let him down and advised people to sell gold and increase their bitcoin holdings. “If they listen to me, they’re going to drop half their gold. I’ve been saying 10% in gold since 1983. And now I say 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin,” he said. However, about two months ago, the Mad Money host said that he sold some bitcoins to pay off his mortgage.Bitcoin’s price slid on Monday to $31,602 at the time of writing based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets as the news of China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), ordering financial institutions to stop all crypto-related activities spread across the markets.The Chinese government has also been closing down bitcoin mining farms in various areas in China. A report in the Chinese Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper claims that more than 90% of the country’s mining capacity is shut down after authorities in Sichuan closed down many mining farms in the province.Cramer opined:When the PRC goes after something, they tend to have their way … It’s not a democracy. It’s a dictatorship. I think that they believe it’s a direct threat to the regime because what it is, is a system that’s outside their control.The Mad Money host has also voiced concerns about bitcoin’s role in ransomware attacks and how the U.S. government will handle the cryptocurrency in its efforts to fight ransomware attacks, such as the ones suffered by Colonial Pipeline and Brazil’s JBS. The Biden administration has made fighting ransomware attacks a priority and is reportedly expanding cryptocurrency analysis to identify criminal transactions.Cramer noted, “In our country, I think it’s outside of our control when it comes to ransomware, and I doubt that Colonial is the first company to pay ransomware. I think they’re the first that almost shut down the East Coast,” elaborating:I think the Justice Department and the FBI and the Federal Reserve and Treasury could coalesce and say, ‘Ok guys, if you pay ransomware, we’re going to go after you.’With China cracking down on bitcoin mining and ransomware attacks, Cramer believes that bitcoin “is not going up because of structural reasons.”What do you think about Jim Cramer dumping his bitcoin due to China’s mining crackdown and ransomware concerns?

770,Financial Advisor Ric Edelman Sees 'Tremendous Investment Opportunities' in Bitcoin,"Jun 21, 2021","Financial advisor Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines and RIA Digital Assets Council, has recommended having bitcoin in investment portfolios despite the cryptocurrency’s volatility. “This is totally new and different and it’s the first genuinely new asset class in about 150 years,” he said, emphasizing that “It has tremendous investment opportunities.”Ric Edelman talked about bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments in an interview with Yahoo Finance last week. He founded Edelman Financial Engines and RIA Digital Asset Council. He is also the author of several personal finance books and the host of a weekly personal finance talk radio show called The Ric Edelman Show.Edelman explained that “most financial professionals,” who have been in business a long time and are “very successful, very talented, and experienced,” are missing out on opportunities from the new asset class because they do not have a good understanding of cryptocurrency, like bitcoin. “The more talent you have, the more professional designations, the more college degrees in this space you have, the more difficult it is to get your head around bitcoin.”Noting that he uses “bitcoin as a proxy for all digital assets,” the financial advisor emphasized, “It’s important to recognize this is a completely new and different asset class that doesn’t have anything in common with anything else we’re familiar with: stocks, bonds, real estate, oil, gold, commodities.” He further opined:This is totally new and different and it’s the first genuinely new asset class in about 150 years … It has tremendous investment opportunities.Regarding how one should invest in bitcoin, Edelman said, “It’s time to get off zero.” He stressed: “We need to recognize that bitcoin and digital assets are non-correlated assets” to traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, making them an “ideal addition to a diversified portfolio … You lower the risk while giving yourself the opportunity to improve returns.”Recently, famed hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones also said that he likes bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier. He recommends putting 5% of portfolios in the cryptocurrency.Edelman acknowledged that bitcoin’s price is volatile and unpredictable. However, he sees enough upside potential in a 1% or 2% allocation in most portfolios. “This can be a materially beneficial way to improve your overall returns over the long term,” he detailed, emphasizing that “it does not take much to have a material impact on your investment portfolio.”The financial advisor also commented on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He said blockchain technology, digital assets, NFTs, CBDCs, and tokens are “the most impactful commercial innovations since the development of the internet itself.” He exclaimed: “This is huge. It’s going to have a tremendous impact on global commerce.”What do you think about Ric Edelman’s advice? Let us know in the comments section below.

771,"Microstrategy Buys $489M Worth of Bitcoin — Company Now Holds More Than 100,000 BTC","Jun 21, 2021","The independent, publicly-traded business intelligence company Microstrategy announced the acquisition of 13,005 bitcoin on Monday, at a purchase price of approximately $489 million in cash. The company’s CEO Michael Saylor revealed the latest purchase on Twitter, and the firm now has more than 100,000 bitcoins on its balance sheet.Michael Saylor’s firm Microstrategy now has approximately 105,085 bitcoins which it bought for around $2.741 billion. Using the purchasing average, the company says it purchased all the BTC at around “$26,080 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.”As usual, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted about the purchase telling his 1.2 million Twitter followers. “As of 6/21/21 we #hodl ~105,085,” Saylor noted on Monday morning.Not everyone was impressed with Microstrategy’s bitcoin buy announcement and a few people like Peter Schiff made snide comments. “That’s pretty bearish that you already bought all that bitcoin and the price kept dropping anyway,” Schiff replied to Saylor’s tweet on Monday.“Consider where the price of bitcoin would be today if Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, Barry Silbert, and all the other bitcoin elites and their friends in the financial media hadn’t spent the last six months convincing retail and institutional investors to buy their worthless tokens,” Schiff said the day prior, as bitcoin’s price began plummeting.Northman Trader’s Sven Henrich also responded to Saylor’s announcement. “Understand the conviction. Question though: As the price average and employed leverage have both been rising what’s the risk profile/consequence if bitcoin were to drop below the average holding price?” Henrich asked the Microstrategy CEO.When someone asked Henrich if Saylor’s choice turned out to be a good bet the Northman Trader further commented. “Not saying he’s wrong,” Henrich replied. “Just asking what the risk profile is if [the] price drops below the average holding price.”Microstrategy’s purchase of 13,005 BTC follows recent news stemming from China’s central bank. On June 21, 2021, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a notice to a number of financial institutions concerning crypto transactions.Since then, BTC has dropped 4% in 24 hours and rests just above the $32K handle. In other words, the price has actually dipped below the price Microstrategy paid per coin for this most recent BTC acquisition.Other bitcoin proponents also responded to Saylor’s tweet. “Time to deploy the next billion,” software developer Jameson Lopp tweeted. An individual commented on Lopp’s statement and jokingly said: “Fixed it: Time to deploy the next borrowed billion.”“Unfortunately, contrary to popular belief one just can’t keep infinitely buying the dip,” an individual said to the many enthusiasts telling the Microstrategy CEO to “keep buying the dip.”What do you think about Microstrategy buying 13,005 bitcoin and aggregating a total of more than 100K bitcoin?

772,The US Government Is Auctioning $377K Worth of Bitcoin and Litecoin,"Jun 21, 2021","The U.S. government is selling bitcoin and litecoin worth $377K via the General Services Administration (GSA). The auction closes at 5 p.m. on Monday, with the possibility of an extended closing time. The government auction house is selling the digital assets in 11 lots and so far, the lots have seen active bidding.From June 18 to Monday, June 21, the General Services Administration, otherwise known as the GSA, is auctioning two types of crypto assets. GSA auction bidders can try to buy 11 lots of crypto that hold approximately 8.93 BTC and 150.2 LTC.The U.S. government estimates the value to be in the ballpark of $377,000 for the aggregate BTC and LTC lots. The GSA announcement notes that the entity has sold crypto assets on behalf of the U.S. government since the beginning of 2021.To date, the GSA has auctioned crypto assets three times and sold 16.99 BTC in total. The three previous GSA auctions settled at $937,092 for the bitcoin assets sold on the platform. The GSA advertisement also tries to entice the reader by saying: “Become a part of the growing cryptocurrency community by placing a winning bid during GSA Auctions’ next cryptocurrency sale.”“Experienced investors recognize a good opportunity when they see it, which is why our auctions have generated so much enthusiasm among the crypto community,” Thomas Meiron, Regional Commissioner for GSA’s Federal Acquisition Service said in a statement. “With the addition of a new type of cryptocurrency, this promises to be one of our most exciting auctions of the year.”The new type of digital asset Meiron refers to is litecoin (LTC), as prior auctions only saw the sale of BTC. The GSA was created in 1949 and is a solution for government-owned surplus, forfeited goods, and federal personal property they no longer require.The independent agency of the U.S. government allows the general public, businesses, and other government agencies to bid on items in an exclusive fashion. Local and international GSA auction buyers are mandated to purchase electronically.The electronic only-purchasing arrangement is due to the President’s declaration of a national emergency on March 23, 2020. Since then, the GSA no longer accepts payments made by cash, money order, cashier’s check, and official or personal checks.The description of the crypto lots being sold explains that when a bidder wins they must accept the responsibility of paying the mining network fee.

773,$135K for December: Stock-to-Flow Creator Lays out Bitcoin's 'Worst Case Scenario for 2021',"Jun 21, 2021","The pseudonymous creator of the popular stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price model, Plan B, has published his “worst case scenario for 2021” predictions on social media on Sunday. The analyst says there’s also a “more fundamental reason” to why bitcoin prices have been dropping in June and how the month of July may see “weakness” as well.Five months ago, bitcoin (BTC) prices went parabolic and the value of the leading crypto asset seemingly was following the well known stock-to-flow (S2F) model. At the time, the S2F creator said: “bitcoin stock-to-flow model [is] on track… like clockwork.” The price of bitcoin skyrocketed over $64K per unit but has since lost more than half that value.At the end of April, Plan B remarked that the downturn was a “mid-way dip” and stressed that “nothing goes up in a straight line.” This past Saturday, Plan B further discussed the infamous death cross pattern in the BTC/USD chart and remained optimistic.Then on Sunday, Plan B gave an update on his “worst case scenario for 2021.”“Bitcoin is below $34K, triggered by Elon Musk’s energy FUD and China’s mining crack down,” Plan B tweeted. “There is also a more fundamental reason that we see weakness in June, and possibly July. My worst case scenario for 2021 (price/on-chain based): Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K,” the analyst added.Of course, Plan B made sure that people read his tweet carefully when people asked if they should disregard his model. “Please read my tweet more carefully,” Plan B replied. “I said this is a worst case scenario, not a base case, let alone best case. I am still on S2FX track for my base case. I have explained my personal (non)selling strategy in several interviews,” he added. Furthermore, someone asked Plan B: “What’s the more fundamental reason?”“Great question. I [intend] to publish later this year,” the analyst replied. Additionally, the popular bitcoiner dubbed “Parabolic Trav” said that he likes a bearish Plan B tweet and said “Bullish.” Plan B also responded to Parabolic Trav’s statement and said:Wait until you [see] my base case and best case scenarios! OK, a hint: best case Dec $450K.Plan B is a popular analyst and has more than 570,000 Twitter followers. The stock-to-flow price model has also grown in popularity during the last 12 months and it is referenced often in technical analysis. Plan B has been getting a lot more criticism in recent times since bitcoin’s price has been dropping lower. The sell-off, Plan B said this weekend, has led to better bitcoin distribution.“60% of bitcoins sold in May-June were bought in March-April and sold at a loss,” Plan B wrote. “40% was bought earlier and sold at a profit. Of total 18.7M bitcoins ~2,5M bitcoins are bought at [below] $10 price level, ~2M BTC at $10-$1K,~2M at $1K-$5K etc. BTC distribution looks a lot healthier now,” the analyst added.What do you think about Plan B’s worst case scenarios for 2021?

775,Paraguayan Lawmaker to Present Bitcoin Legislation Next Month — Aims to Make Paraguay Global Crypto Hub,"Jun 20, 2021","A pro-bitcoin congressman in Paraguay says he will present bitcoin legislation in congress next month with the aim to make Paraguay a hub for cryptocurrency investors worldwide. His efforts follow El Salvador passing a bill making bitcoin legal tender.Following El Salvador passing a bill making bitcoin legal tender, a congressman in Paraguay announced that he is working on bitcoin legislation that will be presented next month.Deputy Carlos Antonio Rejala Helman of the Hagamos Party has called for Paraguay to take similar action to El Salvador regarding bitcoin. The congressman has also changed his Twitter profile picture to include laser eyes, meaning he eyes bitcoin going to $100K.The deputy is preparing a bill that seeks to legalize the use of cryptocurrencies in Paraguay as a means of payment, La Nacion reported Friday. The bill will establish that any transaction within the national territory can be carried out with bitcoin and the state will be in charge of promoting and training the different sectors so that they can access this new form of electronic payments, the publication conveyed.The congressman was quoted as saying:Since we announced that we are working on a bill that legalizes in Paraguay the use of digital assets, better known as digital currencies, or its most popular version, bitcoin, as legal tender for any type of commercial transaction, various Paraguayan companies have already joined and took a step forward towards the new era of transactions, which makes us proud.The lawmaker aims to present his bill in congress in July. Noting that the legislation is being prepared, he tweeted on June 17 with the hashtag bitcoin, “July we legislate.” He followed up with another tweet that says: “The presentation of the project is coming on July 14.”The congressman revealed early this month that he is working with Bitcoin.com.py CEO Juanjo Benitez Rickmann and “the Paraguayan crypto community in order for Paraguay to become a hub for the crypto investors of the world and subsequently to be placed among the ones on the cutting edge of digital technology.”Rickmann confirmed that he is working with the congressman “to introduce a project in congress so that Paraguay becomes a crypto-friendly country for worldwide crypto investors, taking advantage of the renewable and inexpensive energy provided by hydroelectrics #Itaipu #Yacyreta.”The congressman tweeted on June 7:As I was saying a long time ago, our country needs to advance hand in hand with the new generation. The moment has come, our moment.“This week we start with an important project to innovate Paraguay in front of the world. The real one to the moon #BTC & #paypal,” his tweet further reads.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency adoption is growing in Paraguay. A major entertainment group in the country, Grupo Cinco, announced last week that all of its 24 business units now accept cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), shiba inu (SHIB), and chiliz (CHZ). In addition, Universidad Comunera (UCOM), a private university in Asunción, Paraguay, now accepts bitcoin for payments.Would you move to Paraguay if bitcoin is legal tender there?

776,Sichuan Mining Farms Begin to Shut Down — Seven-Day Stats Show Bitcoin’s Hashrate Plummeting,"Jun 20, 2021","The hashrate of the Bitcoin network has been steadily falling since June 14 and after Sichuan miners were told to prepare operation shutdowns. Sichuan is the second-densest province in China where most miners are located, according to data stemming from the University of Cambridge. Bitcoin’s hashrate is now hovering just above 100 exahash per second (EH/s).The hashrate of the Bitcoin network has been steadily falling. The cause of this seems to be the shutdown of several cryptocurrency farms in various provinces including Sichuan. According to the regional publication 8btc news, the Sichuan Development and Reform Commission and Energy Bureau announced it would close the operation of 26 suspected cryptocurrency mining and virtual currency projects on Sunday. Sichuan bitcoin miners leaving to mine elsewhere is a historical event during the leading crypto asset’s 12-year lifespan.Statements from mining insiders seem to point out the situation is dire for big mining operations. These are the most affected due to its inability to move its operations quickly. The hashrate numbers stemming from Chinese pools have also shrunk: Antpool, Btc.com, Binance Pool, Huobi Pool, and Btc.top have all experienced significant losses of associated hashrate. As a consequence, the Bitcoin hashrate is now hovering over 100 EH/s, almost 50% under its all-time high.Bitcoin’s price is also stagnating as a result of fears over more forced mining shutdowns in the country. Bitcoin price is now between $33,000 and $34,000 at the time of writing. Other currencies are also feeling the heat, facing important losses.Sichuan is the fifth Chinese province that is shutting down cryptocurrency mining-related projects. Before Sichuan, two provinces also announced the closing of all cryptocurrency mining projects: Inner Mongolia, and Yunan. Other localized closures were announced in Xinjiang earlier last month when Zhundong based miners were ordered to turn off their machines.Xinjiang is the province where most hashrate resides in all of China, at least according to statistics. A third of all of Bitcoin’s hashrate is located there according to the University of Cambridge. However, this crackdown in Bitcoin mining has spurted opportunities for mining elsewhere.The mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, is inviting miners to set up shop in Miami. Suarez stated that the conditions in Miami could be enticing to miners due to the abundance of cheap nuclear power available. Some mining operations are flocking to Kazakhstan and the Chinese ASIC manufacturer Canaan recently established an overseas after-sales center in the region. Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, is also inviting miners to the country. Bukele announced they would be building geothermal facilities to offer green cheap energy prices to miners just recently. The race to capture these ousted Bitcoin miners is just starting, and other countries might also make their move soon.What do you think about Sichuan cracking down on bitcoin operations?

777,Economist Steve Hanke Warns Salvadoran Bitcoin Adoption Could ‘Completely Collapse the Economy’,"Jun 20, 2021","The professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, Steve Hanke, has recently been criticizing bitcoin adoption taking place in El Salvador. Hanke doesn’t think it’s a good idea for the Latin American country to use bitcoin as legal tender and says it could “completely collapse the economy.”The American economist Steve Hanke knows a lot about currencies, as he is the Cato Institute’s senior fellow and director of the Troubled Currencies Project. Hanke also was the senior economist during the Reagan administration from 1981 to 1982. The economist is critical of central banking and noted in 2018 that the world could use less of them. At the time, Hanke highlighted ten countries that are suffering from hyperinflation and the economist proposed that the countries either adopt the U.S. dollar or create a currency board.“Countries that employed currency boards have delivered lower inflation rates, smaller fiscal deficits, lower debt levels relative to the gross domestic product, fewer banking crises, and higher real growth rates than comparable countries that have employed central banks,” Hanke said at the time.Fast forward to three years later, Hanke is now discussing bitcoin (BTC) and the implications of widespread adoption. Hanke is not a fan of bitcoin and has mentioned this fact on numerous occasions. This past April, Hanke tweeted: “Bitcoin bulls hate to discuss the flaws of bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are the future of money. Bitcoin is not.” The economist also shared an article he wrote, which stresses the use of currency boards over bitcoin.In the article, Hanke talks about the monetary luminary Milton Friedman and Hanke also said he believes bitcoin comes with a “fundamental value of zero.” Hanke is once again attacking bitcoin after finding out that El Salvador would be leveraging bitcoin as legal tender in the Latin American country. Hanke thinks that nations like China or Russia could use El Salvador to cash out and remove USD from the equation.“It has the potential to completely collapse the economy because all the dollars in El Salvador could be vacuumed up, and there’d be no money in the country. They don’t have a domestic currency. You’re not going to pay for your taxi ride with a Bitcoin. It’s ridiculous […] You’ve got 70% of the people in El Salvador don’t even have bank accounts, Hanke stressed during an interview with Kitco’s David Lin. Hanke continued:The big problem with cryptos, in general, is that you can’t convert them into actual real legal tender that’s usable cheaply, and quickly. You can’t Bitcoin, for example, cheaply and easily convert into U.S. dollars.Following the economists’ statements with Kitco’s David Lin, Hanke also shared an article on Twitter written by Bitcoin.com News author Terence Zimwara. The article explains how the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been discussing the country leveraging a digital currency by the year’s end. Hanke did not like this assessment from the CBN and said if it was like El Salvador’s idea, it would likely lead to ruin. Hanke tweeted:If Nigeria’s plans for a digital currency is anything like El Salvador’s Bitcoin plan, it will FAIL. Instead of toying with nutty ideas, Nigeria needs to establish a USD-denominated Currency Board, like the one it had between 1913-1959.Zimbabwean fintech lawyer and crypto proponent Prosper Mwedzi responded to Hanke’s statement about Nigeria and said: “I think a digital currency for Nigeria could improve bc access to financial services depending on [the] design.” Further, a number of others disagreed with Hanke’s commentary and replied to his scathing Nigeria/bitcoin tweet.“Hanke only has a hammer (USD Currency Board) so to him, everything looks like a nail,” another individual wrote. “Bitcoin has no such restrictions and will keep saving weak economies,” the person added.What do you think about Steve Hanke’s commentary about El Salvador and Nigeria?

778,Bearish or Bullish? Bitcoin Traders Argue Over Death Cross Outcome,"Jun 20, 2021","On Saturday, cryptocurrency analysts and traders have been discussing bitcoin’s recent chart patterns and the infamous death cross pattern has been a topical conversation. A number of traders believe when bitcoin’s short-term moving average (MA) dips below the long-term MA, the crypto asset could be bracing for a major sell-off. Meanwhile, others are sure the death cross technical pattern means the price is due to rebound and possibly double-top to higher values than the previous all-time high.On June 19, a number of Twitter conversations, forum posts, and even headlines discussed the technical pattern called the death cross in regard to bitcoin’s (BTC) chart. Bloomberg published an article concerning the death cross on Saturday and the publication featured a few statements from billionaire investor Mark Cuban. The definition of a death cross stemming from Investopedia notes the pattern suggests “the potential for a major sell-off.” The website’s definition adds:The death cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses below its long-term moving average. Typically, the most common moving averages used in this pattern are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.However, the death cross doesn’t necessarily mean a bearish market is due. Investopedia details that death cross events led to traditional stock market crashes during the past century including 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. Death crosses are not unusual and data from Canterbury Investment Management indicates the Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced 84 death crosses since 1929. The popular economist and trader Alex Krüger recently discussed the situation of a death cross in relation to BTC/USD charts.“The Death Cross takes place when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average,” Krüger tweeted. “The Death Cross takes place when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average. Journalists love writing about how a death cross could bring forth a bear market. However, one week historical returns following a bitcoin death cross are POSITIVE. Relax,” Krüger stressed.The popular creator of the bitcoin stock-to-flow model, Plan B, also tweeted about the infamous death cross on Saturday. “Study this chart to see what happened [the] last two times the death cross happened, Q4 2019 and Q1 2020,” Plan B said to his 566,000 followers.However, an individual named Mohit Sorout responded to Plan B’s tweet and noted that there’s been a number of death cross occasions throughout bitcoin’s lifetime.“There have been 6 past death crosses in bitcoin’s lifetime,” Sorout replied to Plan B. “4 have resulted in enormous downside. The two that didn’t lead to a downtrend were towards the end of a bear market, not after a full blown bull run. Choose your bias wisely,” he added.The creator and host of CNBC’s Crypto Trader show Ran Neuner also wrote about the death cross on Saturday too. “Bitcoin shorts are being closed,” Neuner said. “This is confirmation that the shorts were speculative and that it wasn’t miners hedging. We said this would happen in anticipation of the ‘death cross’ that should cross around the 24th June. Expect more FUD. I’m not selling.”A crypto enthusiast called Sultan discussed the death cross situation with his followers as well and said that it may mean the worst is behind us. “Death cross,” Sultan wrote. “Ironically, death crosses are often a sign that the worst is already behind us. At the 2019 DC, Bitcoin had already went through a -47% dip before the DC flashed, with a 52% recovery after. And a -64% dip before the 2020 DC, with a quick 150% recovery,” he added. Another person wrote to Plan B and said:A real death cross is when both MA’s are facing down. Good luck to anyone trading the current cross on BTC.No one really knows what will happen even though a number of traders are confident their predictions will play out. Investor and market watcher John Hostetler also talked about the death cross scenario as well on Saturday. “Only a fool could deny that this Bitcoin DeathCross is more like a bearish cross in red than a bullish one in green,” Hostetler said. “But I do like how the BTC price fell this week, as if to say ‘let’s get it over with, then we can rise’”“In the end, the cross changes little,” Hostetler further stressed. “Big question remains: has this halving cycle peaked? 2 weeks ago I would’ve assigned that a 1% possibility, because I hadn’t looked at the now-dismal chart of Bitcoin S2F multiple in a while. Since then I have raised the odds to ~20%. But that still leaves 80%. So I continue with the Bitcoin double top model, drawing hope from the summer of 2013, when $BTC came within a breath of a Death Cross: grey arrow on the chart,” he concluded.What do you think about the bitcoin death cross chart pattern? Do you expect a bear market or a bull market going forward? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

779,Cornell Economist Says Bitcoin Has 3 Flaws Driving People to Search for Better Alternatives,"Jun 19, 2021","Cornell University professor of economics and former head of the IMF’s China division, Eswar Prasad, sees three major flaws in bitcoin. Because of these flaws, the professor says that “bitcoin really has set off something of a search for a better alternative.”Cornell economics professor Eswar Prasad talked about bitcoin’s flaws in an interview with CNBC Thursday.Prasad is the Nandlal P. Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy and professor of economics at the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. He is also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He was previously chief of the Financial Studies Division in the research department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and, before that, was the head of the IMF’s China division.The first flaw concerns the energy usage in bitcoin mining, which Prasad said is “certainly not good for the environment.” The professor pointed out that in contrast Ethereum is coming up with a method “That is going to be much less energy intensive, and it could deliver a lot of the benefits that bitcoin was supposed to deliver.” He added:It could also make transactions much cheaper and quicker.The second point the professor made was that bitcoin is not so anonymous after all. He cited the Colonial Pipeline case where law enforcement claimed to have recovered $2.3 million in bitcoin. He noted that other cryptocurrencies may offer more anonymity than BTC, such as monero and zcash.The third flaw, according to the professor, is that bitcoin does not work well as a currency. He described BTC transactions as “slow and cumbersome” for use in payments, adding that its market is very volatile and the cryptocurrency has become a speculative asset. Prasad concluded:So bitcoin really has set off something of a search for a better alternative and people seem to be on the lookout for a medium of exchange that does not require them to go through a trusted institution like the government or a commercial bank — but it’s not quite there yet.Do you agree with the professor?

780,Rich Dad Poor Dad's Robert Kiyosaki Warns of 'Biggest Crash in World History' — Expects $24K Bitcoin Price,"Jun 19, 2021","Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has predicted the “biggest crash” in world history. He also expects the price of bitcoin to fall to the $24K level.Famous author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has predicted that the biggest crash in the history of the world is on the way.Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. Over 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.Kiyosaki tweeted Friday:Biggest bubble in world history getting bigger. Biggest crash in world history coming. Buying more gold and silver. Waiting for bitcoin to drop to $24K. Crashes best time to get rich.However, Kiyosaki did not elaborate on how he came up with his BTC price prediction.When the price of bitcoin began falling substantially in May, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author urged people to buy the dip. “I hear ‘I can’t afford bitcoin.’ Bitcoin is crashing, good news. Now is your chance. Get educated. Buy coins that outperform bitcoin for pennies. Stop whining and take action,” he advised at the time.When the BTC price fell to the $37K level on May 30, Kiyosaki tweeted: “Bitcoin crashing. Great news. When price hits $27,000, I may start buying again. Lot will depend upon global-macro environment.” He emphasized: “Remember the problem is not gold, silver, or bitcoin. Problems are the incompetents in government, Fed & Wall Street.”Kiyosaki has long been pro-bitcoin. He believes that the U.S. dollar is dying as the government continues to give people free money. “Do not save. Buy gold, silver, bitcoin. Dollar is dying,” he said in April last year.While the famous author expects the price of bitcoin to fall to the $24K level in his most recent tweet, he is bullish about the cryptocurrency in the long run. He said in April this year that the price of BTC will reach $1.2 million in five years, noting that money printing by the government, excessive stimulus, and the devaluation of the U.S. dollar have given bitcoin and gold their appeal.What do you think about Robert Kiyosaki’s prediction?

781,Figuring Out How Much Bitcoin Hashrate Resides in Mainland China Still a Mystery,"Jun 19, 2021","Over the last few weeks, there have been many reports about crackdowns in China tied to bitcoin mining operations in various provinces. 30-day statistics show the hashrate has been fluctuating wildly, and across the last week it has slid downward roughly 26%.Despite the slide, the top three mining pools in the world, which represent roughly 41% of the hashrate today, are considered Chinese mining pools. This doesn’t necessarily mean the mining pools actually host physical bitcoin mining facilities in mainland China, however.How much hashrate resides in China is the million-dollar question these days. Especially after Beijing’s crackdown on the mining industry and the following bans in a number of provinces.The mandates first appeared in Inner Mongolia, as reports surfaced during the first week of March 2021. Then on June 9, 2021, a report disclosed that specific bitcoin miners in Xinjiang had been instructed to shut down.Another mandate appeared for crypto miners in Qinghai province. After Qinghai province, authorities in Yunnan cracked down on bitcoin mining operations in that region as well.Then, while everyone was waiting to hear about Sichuan, following the May 31 report that notified the public a meeting was taking place, the news finally came. Officials in Sichuan sent notice to bitcoin miners in the province to shut down by June 25.Hashrate charts show during the last seven days, the Bitcoin network hashrate has slipped and currently hovers a hair above the 100 exahash per second (EH/s) zone. The issue is no one is quite sure exactly how much hashrate resides in China, and how many operations are forced to migrate.Many mainstream reports pointed to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance index map, otherwise known as CBECI. The unreliable CBECI map hasn’t been updated since April 2020 and the map indicates 65% of the hashrate is in China.The CBECI data also has significant limitations toward estimation, as it only collects data from three large pools and the “aggregate geo-location data based on the IP addresses of hashers connecting to mining pools.” Cambridge further notes that “hashers in certain locations use virtual private networks (VPNs) or proxy services to hide their IP address and thus location.”Moreover, at any given time, a large number of stealth miners have been known to dedicate hashrate to the BTC network. These stealth miners, otherwise dubbed as “unknown” in hash distribution pie charts, make up around 6% of the network hashrate this weekend. At times, during the last few years, mystery miners have gathered more than 20% of the hashrate.The web portal digiconomist.net is similar, as it shows an unreliable chart with shares of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, but it too has not been updated since April 2020. In China, digiconomist.net’s survey shows operations in Beijing, Nei Mongol, Guangdong, Qinghai, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Guizhou, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Hebei.There’s also a published study from Coinshares, which highlighted that 74% of the world’s bitcoin mining operations were driven by renewable energy in 2019. The in-depth report does contain a survey of a number of mining locations around the world and includes a map.The Coinshares’ map is fairly basic but conveys the general idea that there’s a large portion of miners in China and specifically Sichuan. Between the CBECI map, digiconomist.net chart, and Coinshares’ report we still don’t have an up-to-date percentage of how many miners are located in China.However, there’s a recent report from July 15, 2020, published by Bitooda with support from asset manager Fidelity Investments that cuts China’s hashrate down to 50% from previous estimates.Additionally, faults in the assumptions underpinning the digiconomist.net data have been found. In 2018, another Coinshares’ study had shown criticism toward the Digiconomist’s BECI and noted there was a large discrepancy regarding the total energy consumption data.Finally, the public does have access to data from hashrate distribution by pool names. The top five dominant mining pools today are Antpool, Viabtc, F2pool, Btc.com, and Poolin. In terms of hashrate percentage, below Poolin is Binance Pool, an unknown entity, and Foundry USA, respectively.Measuring data this way is faulty because not all pools are hard operations, as many pools are a mix of hashpower from physical facilities and miners from all around the world pooling computing power with the pool. There is no known location for Binance Pool and Poolin says its operation is headquartered in Hong Kong.Poolin’s website details that it does have offices in Beijing, Chengdu, and Changsha, China. Bitmain’s Antpool says its headquarters is in China, and Viabtc’s records and F2pool (formally known as Discus Fish) also show China-based headquarters.Btc.com’s records indicate the mining company’s headquarters resides in Amsterdam. Roughly 41% of the hashrate could be considered as being from Chinese pools, but we cannot be sure of how much of this hashpower actually stems from mainland China.As stated previously, Chinese bitcoin mining pools are not necessarily located in China. Fact is, figuring out exactly how much bitcoin hashrate resides in mainland China is still a puzzle. Look out for the follow-up to this comprehensive report that covers the complete landscape of Bitcoin hashrate distribution over the last 12 years.What do you think about the geographical locations of miners? How much hashrate do you think resides in China? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

782,Basketball Players in Canada to Be Paid in Bitcoin,"Jun 19, 2021","CEBL, the Canadian men’s basketball league, will offer its professional basketball players the option to receive a portion of their salary in cryptocurrency. The new payment option has been enabled through a partnership with the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Bitbuy. The Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL) announced the deal with Bitbuy days before the start of its third season, on June 24. The league, which was founded four years ago, launched in 2019 with six teams, all of them owned and managed by the Canadian Basketball Ventures group. It now says the crypto partnership will be the first of its kind for any professional sports league in North America. CEBL Commissioner and CEO Mike Morreale commented:Our partnership with Bitbuy speaks to our commitment to players, and also to our forward-thinking approach to how we go about our business. We appreciate Bitbuy’s investment in helping us further grow Canada’s official national pro basketball league.With the help of Bitbuy, the basketball players will be able to opt-in to receive a portion of their salary in bitcoin (BTC). The trading platform will convert the Canadian dollar payments into cryptocurrency and deposit the digital coins to the players’ personal crypto wallets. The exchange, which has more than 300,000 users in Canada, will also become an official sponsor of the league as part of the agreement with the CEBL.According to Charlie Aikenhead, VP of Marketing at Bitbuy, the partnership represents a significant shift in how athletes are thinking about compensation. “We’re excited to help the CEBL’s players protect their long-term wealth by getting paid in Bitcoin,” he added, emphasizing that the crypto company is proud to support homegrown Canadian sports.The cooperation between Bitbuy and the CEBL comes in response to basketball players voicing interest in crypto payments to the league’s management. They referred to the case of NFL’s Russell Okung who last year became the first professional athlete in North America to be paid in bitcoin. In December, the Carolina Panthers offensive lineman announced he would be getting half of his 13 million-dollar salary in BTC, as Bitcoin.com News reported.Guelph Nighthawks’ guard Kimbal Mackenzie, who will be among the first CEBL players to receive remuneration in crypto, was quoted in a press release as saying:The opportunity to be paid in bitcoin is something I’m incredibly excited about. I believe cryptocurrency is the future.Mackenzie thinks this is an investment that will appreciate greatly over the next decades and insists that his decision was a no-brainer. The crypto salary option, in his view, also highlights that the CEBL is one of the top professional sports leagues in the world.Cryptocurrency prices have increased significantly over the past year as both individual investors and companies sought to protect their funds in uncertain economic times due to the global pandemic. BTC, the crypto with the largest market capitalization, reached a record high of over $63,000 in April. It has since dropped to below $40,000 per coin and is currently trading between $35,000 and $36,000 on Saturday.Do you expect other sports leagues to offer their players the option to get paid in cryptocurrency?

783,Goldman Sachs Leverages Crypto Management Firm Galaxy Digital to Swap Bitcoin Futures,"Jun 18, 2021","Galaxy Digital’s co-president Damien Vanderwilt announced today that his firm has partnered with Goldman Sachs to help provide bitcoin futures products. The partnership marks one of the first occasions where an American multinational investment bank has partnered with a crypto asset service provider.Goldman Sachs is trading bitcoin futures products with Galaxy Digital according to statements made by Galaxy’s co-president Damien Vanderwilt during an interview with CNBC.Galaxy Digital is a financial services and investment management innovator founded by the company’s CEO Mike Novogratz. Vanderwilt explains that Goldman Sachs, the bank with $2.1 trillion assets under management (AUM), may entice other financial incumbents to follow its lead.“There’s a whole dynamic with the major banks that I’ve seen time and time again: safety in numbers,” Vanderwilt explained during his discussion about the subject. “Once one bank is out there doing this, the other banks will have [fear of missing out] and they’ll get on-boarded because their clients have been asking for it.”According to Vanderwilt, Goldman depends on Galaxy because regulatory policy stops the multinational investment bank from handling the leading crypto asset directly. Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman’s Asia-Pacific region said during the announcement that the bank procures clientele with the assets they demand.“Our goal is to equip our clients with best-execution pricing and secure access to the assets they want to trade,” Minton remarked. “In 2021, this now includes crypto, and we are pleased to have found a partner with a broad range of liquidity venues and differentiated derivatives capabilities spanning the cryptocurrency ecosystem.”The statements from Minton and Vanderwilt follow the report that said Goldman was prepping to offer ether futures and options swaps. At the time, Goldman said “institutional adoption will continue” in the crypto space.In mid-April Galaxy Digital revealed it had entered the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) fray when it submitted its Form S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).Vanderwilt also said that when more institutional players join the crypto ecosystem volatility will grow less and less.“You’re moving the market participants from being north of 90% retail, a huge chunk of which have access to ridiculous amounts of leverage, into an institutional community, who have proper, tried-and-tested rules and regulations about leverage, asset-liability mismatch, and risk,” Vanderwilt concluded. “The more activity that moves into the institutional community, the less volatility there will be.”What do you think about Goldman Sachs and Galaxy Digital partnering to offer bitcoin futures to clients?

Suarez says he hasn’t actually talked to any miners from China but said he wants them to know the opportunity is there.According to an interview, Francis Suarez, the American attorney and 43rd mayor of Miami, is inviting Chinese miners to his city to set up shop if they desire.Suarez is a fan of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the decentralized crypto asset bitcoin (BTC), and he has explained that he owns BTC as well. The Miami mayor has also said on a number of occasions that he wants the city of Miami to become a crypto hub for entrepreneurs and builders.On Thursday, Suarez told CNBC he’s inviting Chinese miners to seek shelter in the region after the crackdown stemming from Beijing. Suarez explained that the region has an abundance of clean and cheap electricity thanks to nuclear energy.“We want to make sure that our city has an opportunity to compete,” Suarez said during his interview. “We’re talking to a lot of companies and just telling them, ‘Hey, we want you to be here,’” the mayor added.Suarez made these statements to CNBC from the second floor of the Miami City Hall building which is located near the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant. In fact, Florida houses a great abundance of nuclear power plants all over the state.“The fact that we have nuclear power means that it’s very inexpensive power,” Suarez stressed during his chat with the press in Miami. According to CNBC’s report, miners in Miami could obtain a rate of 10.7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).At $0.11 per kWh, a Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro with 110 terahash per second (TH/s) can get around $18.59 per day using current BTC exchange rates. The Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ 112 TH/s gets around $18.50 per day at $0.11 per kWh according to data from asicminervalue.com.Suarez’s invitation to Chinese miners comes at a time when governments in China’s provinces are banning bitcoin mining operations. The latest crackdown happened today, as Sichuan miners have been instructed to close shop by June 25, 2021.“We understand how important this is… miners want to reach a certain kilowatt price per hour, and we’re working with them on it,” Suarez told CNBC.What do you think about Miami’s mayor trying to woo Chinese miners to the city?

786,Officials in Sichuan Instruct Bitcoin Miners to Shut Down Operations: Report,"Jun 18, 2021","According to regional reports, bitcoin miners in Sichuan have been told by the Ya’an municipal government that they have until June 25 to shut down operations. Sichuan has been eyed closely in recent times as it’s estimated that a large demographic of miners are situated in the region.Sichuan power plants have been told to stop servicing bitcoin miners in the area according to reports stemming from the Ya’an municipal government. The regional publication Panews was told by an “insider” that the Sichuan Ya’an Energy Bureau and the Science and Technology Bureau held a meeting about the decision and came to a resolution to “clean up and rectify bitcoin mining companies in Ya’an.”The Panews report further says that all mines need to shut down on June 25 and it includes abandoning hydropower plants as well. Additionally, the Chinese journalist Colin “Wu” Blockchain reported on the incident on Twitter.“On June 18, Sichuan officially issued a document requesting power generation companies are required to immediately stop supplying power to any virtual currency mining, and report the relevant situation on the 25th,” the reporter noted. He further added:The document identified 26 large mining projects and required to be monitored and shut down. At present, the hashrate of Bitcoin and Ethereum has not fluctuated. There are many small and medium-sized hydropower stations in Yunnan, Sichuan, and it may be difficult for them to receive government supervision. However, large-scale projects will be shut down in the short term.There have been various reports during the last few weeks noting that a number of provinces in China have been cracking down on bitcoin mining. Many of these reports have been sharing the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance index map which claims to show 65% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate resides in China. However, the CBECI hashrate map is not reliable whatsoever, as the map has not been updated since April 2020.Bitcoin’s hashrate has been sliding in recent weeks and fluctuating wildly as well. Miners from China have seen lots of shuffling among pools in terms of bitcoin hashrate distribution. At the time of writing, the hashrate is around 120 exahash per second (EH/s) after being above 140 EH/s six hours ago.What do you think about Sichuan province shutting down bitcoin miners in the region?

787,Bitcoin Mining Company Bitfarms to Commence Trading on Nasdaq Next Week,"Jun 18, 2021","The mining company Bitfarms has revealed the firm will commence trading on Nasdaq Global Select Market starting on June 21. The firm claims to process 1% of the global hashrate and with “99% green hydroelectricity.” The Canadian bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms announced on Thursday that the company will be listed on Nasdaq on Monday, June 21. The company is already listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and leverages the ticker “BITF.”For the Nasdaq listing, the company will utilize the same ticker symbol. According to the announcement, Bitfarms has obtained DTC eligibility which essentially means shares can be deposited through DTC, the largest securities depository in the world.“Listing on Nasdaq is an important achievement for Bitfarms and is a significant milestone following multiple years of development and achievement by the company,” Bitfarms’ founder and chief executive officer Emiliano Grodzki said during the announcement.“We started this company four years ago with a clear belief in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. This belief has guided us as we worked to build one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations worldwide,” Grodzki added.Bitfarms’ website says that it currently operates 69 megawatts of energy and dedicates around 1,420 petahash per second (PH/s) of SHA256 hashrate. The rate of Bitfarms’ facilities located in Quebec turns out to be around 1.42 exahash per second (EH/s).Bitfarms operates bitcoin mining plants in the Quebec regions of Farnham, Cowansville, Sherbrooke, Saint-Hyacinthe, and Magog. Bitfarms is not the only crypto mining company getting listed these days as Hut 8 Mining was also approved for Nasdaq listing earlier this week.However, Grodzki details that Bitfarms will be the largest publicly traded miner, in terms of hashrate and operations nearly all powered by green energy.“When Bitfarms begins trading on the Nasdaq, it will be the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner in North America using greater than 99% hydroelectric renewable electricity,” Grodzki remarked.Statistics, at least according to both firm’s websites, shows Bitfarms has a bit more hashpower than Hut 8. While Hut 8 consumes 109 megawatts of energy, the firm’s mining operations in Medicine Hat and Drumheller, Alberta dedicate around 1,073 PH/s of SHA256 hashrate to secure the Bitcoin network.What do you think about Bitfarms listing shares on Nasdaq?

788,Camarasal Poll Shows Entrepreneurs Are Worried About Bitcoin Law in El Salvador,"Jun 18, 2021","Camarasal, a well known entrepreneur association in El Salvador, announced the results of a poll made this month. The poll shows almost 100% of Salvadorans worry about the implementation of the bitcoin tender law approved recently. Most criticize the obligatory character of receiving bitcoin payments and don’t expect this move to bring investment to the country.A quick poll conducted by Camarasal, one of the biggest entrepreneur groups in El Salvador, is showing people have deep concerns about the future application of the Bitcoin Law. The poll got more than 1,600 answers in just four days from entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. Camarasal president Jorge Hasbún stated on the massive participation that:We believe that this excellent response is a reflection of how urgent this issue is for Salvadorans, in the sense of the implications it will have for the family economy on a day-to-day basis.More than 96% of the entrepreneurs polled prefer an optional use of bitcoin for payments. The bitcoin tender law forces entrepreneurs to accept bitcoin for payments, as long as the entrepreneur manages the technological infrastructure to do so. In the same way, 45.3% indicated they were concerned that the circulation of cryptocurrency in the country is mandatory; while 35.9% assured that it generates mistrust.Also, most of the entrepreneurs won’t keep the bitcoin received as payment for their goods and services: 51.6% of them answered they would exchange the bitcoin received for dollars. Bitcoin is a pretty volatile asset too, and that scares entrepreneurs that work with tight margins.Camarasal also polled non-entrepreneurs, but the answers were not optimistic either. About using bitcoin as a medium of exchange, 36% said they are concerned and 39% said they distrusted it. The topic of wages and remittances was also included in the poll. El Salvador is a remittance-intensive country, with 23% of the GDP coming from these, according to AP. 93.2% said that they do not want to receive their salary in cryptocurrency, while 82.5% assured that they are not interested in receiving remittances in bitcoin.Salvadoreans are still lack training on bitcoin and its management, and that might be the key behind these unoptimistic answers. Camarasal vicepresident Carmen Alas stated:It will be essential that there is a broad consultation with an interdisciplinary group that represents the sectors involved for the construction of the regulations that make this law operationalWhat do you think about Camarasal’s latest poll in El Salvador?

789,Co-Owner of Mirror Trading International Opposes Plans to Liquidate the Bitcoin Scam Outfit,"Jun 18, 2021","In the latest twist to the Mirror Trading International liquidation saga, Clynton Marks, a co-owner of the bitcoin Ponzi outfit, has opposed attempts to have a court grant a final liquidation order. Marks, who reportedly owned 50% of MTI, argues that the liquidation application was “premature” and that liquidators may “not have the members’ best interests at heart.”As explained in a Mybroadband report, Marks, who recently battled a team of MTI liquidators in a South African court, argues that the liquidation notification process was not properly carried out. Marks asserts that he and his wife, Cheri Marks (Head of Communications for MTI), were supposed to be served with the notice.In addition, the MTI co-founder says that the recovery of 1,200 bitcoins belonging to MTI from FX Choice nullifies the liquidators’ insolvency argument. In their statement to Mybroadband, the Markses added:MTI is a solvent company and any chance of members (however slight) to get any relief would not come from the liquidation process but rather from finding Johann (Steynberg) and rightfully encouraging him to rectify whatever wrongs he has allegedly committed. Further to this, it is our belief there are other options more suitable to result in possibly achieving relief for MTI members.The statement also suggests that if this liquidation process were to proceed “members would be severely prejudiced.”Meanwhile, the report says its sources inside the liquidators’ legal team are confident that a final liquidation order will be granted. The report also reveals that the court has reserved judgment in the case for the time being, which pits the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and court-appointed liquidators against parties that are opposed to the dissolution of the company.MTI, which was ranked as the biggest bitcoin scam of 2020 by a blockchain analysis firm, collapsed after its CEO Johann Steynberg disappeared with investors’ funds in December 2020. The collapse subsequently forced disgruntled investors to initiate liquidation proceedings against MTI and Steynberg.Do believe liquidation to be the best option for MTI investors?

791,SEC Seeks Commentary From 'Interested' Individuals on Vaneck Bitcoin ETF,"Jun 17, 2021","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently seeking additional commentary from the public, as the regulating body ponders the Vaneck bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision. In a notice published on Wednesday, the SEC thinks “interested persons” should provide comments on the proceedings.In December 2020, New York-based investment management firm Vaneck filed with the SEC to list a bitcoin ETF. Following the original filing, in March 2021, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) applied to list the Vaneck Bitcoin Trust. Then at the end of April, as the U.S. regulator was determining whether or not it would reach a conclusion on the Vaneck ETF, the SEC gave itself 45 more days to decide.The SEC’s order detailed that the notice of designation has been postponed to June 17, 2021. The regulator could increase it to a “longer period up to 90 days” the notice said. “As the Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons,” the U.S. regulator’s order revealed. The order was composed by the SEC’s assistant secretary Matt DeLesDernier on April 28, 2021.This week, on June 16, 2021, the SEC has disclosed that it’s seeking commentary from “interested persons” who are for or against the Vaneck bitcoin ETF listing. Interested commenters have approximately 21 days to give a statement to the regulator.“The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act14 to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change, as discussed below,” the SEC’s June 16 notice discloses. The announcement adds:[The] institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change.The U.S. regulator declares that its methods for decision-making are in the best interests of the public. Moreover, the SEC may institute procedures that allow for further review of the proposed rule change.“Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act, the Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration,” the notice details. “The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change’s consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and ‘to protect investors and the public interest.’”This is not the first time the U.S. regulator has asked for statements concerning approval or disapproval of a bitcoin-based ETF in the country. So far, however, despite the many applicants in 2021 and previous years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF.What do you think about the SEC seeking commentary on the Vaneck Bitcoin Trust? Do you think the U.S. regulator will approve a bitcoin ETF this year? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.

Canaan plans to deliver the 10,000 A1246 and A1166 Pro Avalonminers by the end of the month.The company Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) has been making lots of business moves in 2021, as the ASIC mining rig manufacturer believes it will see around $250 million in revenue at the end of the second quarter.The larger share of expected revenue is due to a number of mining rig orders placed in 2021 from a variety of companies purchasing thousands of Avalonminers.

Mirakhmedov further added:Our strategy has always been to grow faster than the rest of the market. Achieving this requires building and launching new data centers, expanding the capacities of our existing facilities, and installing first-class hardware. Our recent purchase orders for Canaan’s Avalon Miners will help us to increase our hash rate by a minimum of twofold over the upcoming months.Genesis Digital Assets was launched in 2013 and claims to have mined “over US$1 billion in bitcoin” since then. “As of June 2021, Genesis Digital Assets’ data center capacity was more than 140MW, translating into a total hashrate in excess of 2.1 EH/s, which is more than 1.4% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate,” the company’s disclosure notes.Canaan has been revealing orders all year long with companies like Mawson Infrastructure Group and Hive Blockchain. The Beijing-based ASIC mining rig manufacturer also launched a new submerged liquid-cooled bitcoin miner this year called the Avalonminer A1066I.In recent times, since the bitcoin mining crackdown in China, Canaan disclosed that the company was developing an ASIC mining rig service in Kazakhstan.

Moreover, most fund managers believe bitcoin is in a bubble and agree with the Fed that inflation is transitory.Bank of America (BofA) released its June Global Fund Manager Survey this week. The survey, conducted between June 4-10, covers 224 fund managers with $667 billion under management.The fund managers were asked about many issues of concern to investors, ranging from where the economy and markets are heading to how much cash portfolio managers are holding and which trades they see as most overdone.“Long commodities” is now the most crowded trade, overtaking “long bitcoin” which is now the second most crowded trade. The third most crowded trade is “long tech stock,” followed by “long ESG,” “short U.S. Treasuries,” and “long euro.”Despite the BTC price pullback, 81% of the fund managers surveyed still think that bitcoin is in a bubble. This is a slight increase from May when 75% of the fund managers surveyed said bitcoin was in a bubble zone. Bank of America itself has also warned about the cryptocurrency being in a bubble. The bank’s chief investment strategist said in January bitcoin was “the mother of all bubbles.”Meanwhile, 72% of fund managers say that inflation is transitory, agreeing with what the Fed has been saying.

799,Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Doubles Down on His $250K by 2022 Bitcoin Price Prediction,"Jun 16, 2021","American venture capital investor Tim Draper still believes in a bitcoin price prediction he made in mid-April 2018, at the Draper University blockchain party. At the time, Draper said that he thinks bitcoin could reach $250K by 2022, and during an interview with CNBC’s Jade Scipioni this week, Draper reiterated his six-digit bitcoin price forecast.Tim Draper, the venture capitalist who has his hands in a myriad of blockchain and crypto companies, discussed his bitcoin (BTC) price prediction with CNBC this week.Draper is well known in the crypto community as he has founded a number of firms that work within the industry. He has also founded organizations like Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ), Draper University, Draper Venture Network, Draper Associates, and Draper Goren Holm.Draper is famous for purchasing thousands of bitcoin (BTC) in July 2014 from the U.S. Marshals Service auction that sold BTC stemming from the Silk Road marketplace. Back then, Draper predicted that BTC would reach $10K per coin and this prediction came to fruition. This made people begin to think of Draper as an oracle, and he was pressed for a new prediction when BTC came close to the $20K zone in 2017.After many reporters asked Draper his next bitcoin price forecast, he finally answered on Friday the 13th, April 2018. “Serious winds (of change) at our block(chain) party last night,” Draper explained to his followers on Twitter. “I predict $250K by 2022,” Draper added. Since then, as far as predictions are concerned, Draper stepped out of the limelight and many other investors have given their own bitcoin price predictions over the last three years.Now that BTC has tapped a new all-time-high above $64K per unit, Draper is once again standing behind his $250K prediction. While speaking with CNBC’s Jade Scipioni on the broadcast “CNBC Make It,” Draper said:I think I’m going to be right on this one. I’m either going to be really right or really wrong [but] I’m pretty sure that it’s going in that direction.Draper then explained that he thinks merchants will flock to support BTC within the next few years. “Give it about a year and a half and retailers will all be on Opennode, so everybody will accept bitcoin,” Draper stressed. “Then beyond that, I think [bitcoin] continues up because there are only 21 million of them,” the venture capitalist added.The executive also touched upon dogecoin (DOGE) during his interview and explained that there has to be something that makes the public like the dog token.“There must be something to dogecoin because it makes us all smile but no engineers are working on it,” Draper said. “Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising. I tend to focus on the ones where people are dedicating their lives to improving the currency.”Draper told CNBC he thinks bitcoin will be the center of financial activity worldwide for a long time and described BTC as one of the world’s tech giants. “[Bitcoin] is sort of like Microsoft [in] the software world or Amazon in the e-commerce world,” Draper remarked.Furthermore, before Draper made his prediction the venture capitalist spoke about Elon Musk and Tesla’s critique of Bitcoin’s energy use. He commended Musk for what he had previously accomplished but in terms of understanding bitcoin’s energy consumption, Draper thinks he’s wrong.“Elon, first of all, is one of the most brilliant men in the world…maybe the most brilliant, [but] he got this one wrong,” Draper said.What do you think about Tim Draper’s 2022 bitcoin price prediction?

800,Tunisian Minister Says He Plans to 'Decriminalize' the Buying of Bitcoin,"Jun 16, 2021","After reports that Tanzanian President Samia Hassan had asked her finance chief to look into cryptocurrencies, Tunisia has become the latest African country to signal a willingness to embrace digital assets. According to remarks attributed to Ali Kooli, Tunisia’s economy minister, the North African state will soon move to decriminalize the buying of bitcoin. This comes after the recently reported arrest of a 17-year-old crypto user. According to reports, Minister Kooli says he wants to decriminalize the purchase of bitcoin in order to avoid having another Tunisian youth jailed. This by way of running afoul of the country’s unclear cryptocurrency regulation. He said in a recent TV interview:I will change the law, we cannot put a Tunisian young man in prison for buying bitcoin.The government official’s remarks follow recent Tunisian reports of the arrest of a 17-year-old crypto user by law enforcement. After the teenager’s reported arrest on suspicion of money laundering, in light of the country’s lack of clear crypto laws, some members of Tunisia’s blockchain community slammed the government’s heavy-handed approach. In addition, on social media crypto enthusiasts and sympathizers launched a movement that denounced the crypto user’s arrest.Meanwhile, with these comments, Minister Kooli becomes the latest Tunisian official to embrace crypto. In 2020, Marouane Abbasi, governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, said the country needed to follow bitcoin and had to prepare for effective monitoring of its use cases.What are your thoughts on Tunisia’s plan to decriminalize bitcoin?

801,"Finance Guru Suze Orman Likes Bitcoin Despite Regulation, Elon Musk Effect","Jun 15, 2021","Personal finance guru and best-selling author Suze Orman has given advice on how to invest in bitcoin. She likes the cryptocurrency as a long-term investment despite regulatory uncertainty and the influence Tesla CEO Elon Musk seems to have on the bitcoin market.Suze Orman has shared her bitcoin investment strategy in an interview with CNBC Monday. The Suze Orman Financial Group founder, whose show ran on CNBC from 2002 to 2015, has written 10 consecutive New York Times bestsellers about personal finance. She was named twice on Time Magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people and was appointed as a personal finance educator for the United States Army and Army Reserve in 2016. In addition, she won two Emmy Awards and eight Gracie Awards.Emphasizing that she likes bitcoin as a long-term investment but not as a currency, the famed author of the book “The Ultimate Retirement Guide for 50+” said:You have to hold it for the long run.She previously said, “Any money that you can afford to lose, then I don’t have a problem with you investing in bitcoin.” Orman also warned that the price of bitcoin could still sink to the $30,000 level or even to $26,000. The price of BTC is $40,134 at the time of writing based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.The famed financial advisor believes that bitcoin is a legitimate investment largely due to major corporations pouring millions of dollars into the cryptocurrency. In addition, she said the American youth likes it, noting, “You really have to validate them as to where they are going.”Regarding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweets affecting the price of bitcoin, Orman opined:I don’t like that one man can come out and say something and it controls the market.When Tesla announced that it had invested in BTC and would accept the cryptocurrency for payments, the price of bitcoin soared and then plummeted when Musk said that his electric car company had suspended accepting bitcoin due to environmental concerns. When Musk clarified that Tesla will resume accepting BTC “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.”Orman also dislikes bitcoin being used in ransomware attacks. She questioned:Will the government come in and start to regulate it and everything?The Biden administration has made ransomware a priority and the G7 leaders have called on Russia to urgently “identify, disrupt, and hold to account” ransomware hackers and those abusing cryptocurrency to launder ransoms.Despite regulatory uncertainty and Musk seemingly affecting the price of bitcoin with his tweets, Orman said:I still think for the long run … it’s a place to put some money and just leave it, but not a lot.Orman further pointed out that besides purchasing cryptocurrencies directly, investors can also gain exposure to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies by buying stocks of companies that invest in BTC or are engaged in crypto projects. “There are other ways to play it other than just simply buying the crypto itself,” Orman suggested, naming Microstrategy and Square as examples.What do you think about Suze Orman’s bitcoin advice?

802,Fidelity Executive Believes Bitcoin's Price 'Bottom Is in' After Last Month's Market Carnage,"Jun 15, 2021","On Monday, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity, told his 56,000 Twitter followers his perspective on current bitcoin prices. “In my view, it looks like the bottom is in,” the Fidelity executive explained, sharing a BTC/USD chart. In mid-April, bitcoin (BTC) prices touched an all-time high at $64,895 per coin and then plummeted to $30,066 per unit on May 19. The price of BTC has not fallen below the $30K threshold but a number of investors have speculated that it could.There’s been a few predictions noting that $20K BTC prices could be in the cards, while others are still hopeful BTC will achieve six-digit values by the end of the year. On Monday the director of global macro at Fidelity, Jurrien Timmer, tweeted that he believes bitcoin’s price has dropped to its lowest point.“In my view, it looks like the bottom is in,” Timmer tweeted. Of course, the post was popular among bitcoiners, having gathered more than 4K likes and close to 700 retweets since Timmer posted. One individual thought Timmer’s opinion was on point and said: “Agreed. Bottom is in.” Although, not everyone agreed with Timmer’s chart and analysis. Macro Hedge Fund strategist Kevin Wides sees BTC falling as low as $12K.“My log scale graph showing Bitcoin can fall to $12K is an analysis,” Wides responded to the Fidelity executive’s tweet. “I really don’t care where it goes as I’m neither long nor short – I won’t invest in things that cannot be valued by traditional/sustainable economic metrics,” he added.Quite a few Fidelity Investments executives are fans of bitcoin (BTC) and the digital currency economy. Abigail Johnson, the CEO of Fidelity Investments, has explained her fascination with bitcoin for many years now. At a conference in 2017, Johnson told attendees the firm mined bitcoin and employees were allowed to pay for lunch with BTC at the headquarters’ cafeteria. Since then the company has introduced its digital asset investment subsidiary and other services dedicated to the growing crypto economy.The company’s first bitcoin fund raised $102 million from high-net-worth individuals when it launched last summer. A filing shows the Fidelity Digital Funds subsidiary saw 83 investors raise approximately $102,350,437. Jurrien Timmer’s tweet about bitcoin’s possible bottom is also not the first time the Fidelity executive has discussed the subject. In March, Timmer wrote in a Fidelity Insights report that bitcoin’s evolution has found its way into the investment portfolio.“Bitcoin, by design, is a finite asset, with both a unique supply and a unique demand dimension, and as its network increases, bitcoin’s value and durability could increase even faster,” Timmer wrote. “In my view, some investors may wish to consider bitcoin, alongside other alternatives, as one component of the bond side of a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio,” the director of global macro at Fidelity added.What do you think about Jurrien Timmer’s prediction that the “bottom is in” as far as bitcoin prices are concerned?

804,Latin American Countries Eye Bitcoin Adoption After El Salvador Passed Bitcoin Law,"Jun 14, 2021","A number of lawmakers in Latin American countries have expressed their interest in bitcoin following El Salvador passing the law making the cryptocurrency legal tender. The countries include Paraguay, Argentina, Panama, Brazil, and Mexico. Tonga and Tanzania have also reportedly expressed interest in bitcoin.After El Salvador passed the bill making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, a growing number of lawmakers in neighboring countries have either expressed their interest in making a similar move or put laser eyes on their Twitter profile pictures.The laser eyes meme has swept through the bitcoin community since February with the underlying meaning that anyone donning the eyes is laser-focused on bitcoin’s price rising to $100,000. Politicians, celebrities, and investors have partaken and put laser eyes on their profile images.Gabriel Silva, Member of Parliament in Panama, tweeted congratulating El Salvador when the bitcoin law was approved. “Good news for El Salvador who is teaching the government of Panama in entrepreneurship and technology. We have to think beyond the canal and free zones, betting on the knowledge economy, quality education for all and facilitating new businesses.” He emphasized:This is important, and Panama cannot be left behind. If we want to be a true technology and entrepreneurship hub, we have to support cryptocurrencies. We will be preparing a proposal to present at the assembly.Carlitos Rejala, a congressman and the National Deputy of Paraguay, has called for his government to take similar action to El Salvador. Putting laser eyes on his profile picture, he tweeted: “As I was saying a long time ago, our country needs to advance hand in hand with the new generation. The moment has come, our moment.”Fábio Ostermann, an elected member of the Legislative Assembly in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has also put laser eyes on his profile picture. Argentina’s deputy Francisco Sánchez also temporarily put laser eyes on his profile picture, tweeting, “I can’t believe it, but this is how it is.”Commenting on the growing list of countries becoming interested in bitcoin after El Salvador’s bitcoin law passed, Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, tweeted last week:First they ignore you, then suddenly Paraguay, Argentina, Panama, Brazil, El Salvador, Nicaragua embrace bitcoin.Several lawmakers in Mexico also put laser eyes on their profile pictures, including Senator Indira Kempis, who replied to the tweet by Tyler Winklevoss with an emoji of the flag of Mexico. Moreover, Senator Eduardo Murat Hinojosa has announced plans to bring a regulatory proposal on cryptocurrencies before the national Legislative Branch. He tweeted last week:I will be promoting and proposing a legal framework for cryptocurrencies in Mexico’s lower house.Some other countries that have expressed interest include Tonga, a Polynesian country, and Tanzania, an East African country. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has called on the Tanzanian Central Bank to begin working on facilitating the widespread use of cryptocurrencies in the country. In Tonga, Lord Fusitu’a, Member of Parliament of the Kingdom of Tonga, is a bitcoin advocate. He has laser eyes on his Twitter profile picture and has attended a Twitter spaces meeting with bitcoiners to discuss how his country can benefit from the cryptocurrency.El Salvador could set a trend of nations adopting bitcoin. JPMorgan recently said that “similarly situated” countries could follow El Salvador’s move to make bitcoin legal tender. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it sees legal and economic issues regarding this move by El Salvador.Do you think more countries will make bitcoin legal tender like El Salvador?

805,Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones Says 'I Like Bitcoin' — Will Go All in on Inflation Trades if Fed Says 'Things Are Good',"Jun 14, 2021","Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones says he likes bitcoin. Noting that he can trust math, the famed hedge fund manager said, “bitcoin has appealed to me because it’s a way for me to invest in certainty.” Jones also shared his investment strategies in response to the Fed’s policy.Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of asset management firm Tudor Investment Corp., explained to CNBC Monday why he likes bitcoin. He described:I like bitcoin. Bitcoin is math and math has been around for thousands of years. 2+2 is going to equal 4 and it will for the next 2,000 years. So, I like the idea of investing in something that’s reliable, consistent, honest, and 100% certain. So, bitcoin has appealed to me because it’s a way for me to invest in certainty.“I look at the difference between the Fed in 2013 and Fed of 2021 … I look at the difference between Trump and Biden,” Jones noted. “Do I want to have faith and that same reliability and consistency in human nature?”When asked if he likes bitcoin at the current price, Jones replied:I like bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier … The only thing that I know for certain is I want to have 5% in gold, 5% in bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities at this point in time.“I don’t know what I want to do with the other 80%,” the famed hedge fund manager admitted. “I want to wait and see what the Fed is going to do because what they do will have a big impact.”A 5% allocation is a significant increase from his earlier allocation of between 1% and 2% that he revealed last year.He further shared, “I have a defensive position in bitcoin to protect myself, my family, and our wealth over time.” He also said he does not look at the price of bitcoin anymore, implying that he is a hodler.Jones also offered his views on inflation and the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. He said the Fed meeting this week could be the most important meeting in Chairman Jay Powell’s career, and “certainly the most important Fed meeting of the past four or five years.” Clarifying why the meeting is so important, he said:The reason why is because we’ve had so much incoming data that challenges both their mission and their model. So how they react to that will be extraordinarily important and I think for investors as to how they should deal with their portfolios going forward.Jones explained that consecutive consumer price index readings put price pressures well ahead of the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. However, Fed officials continue to insist that the current readings are transitory and unlikely to persist. Jones disagreed, emphasizing that “It’s an intellectual incongruity that risks damaging their forecasts if they’re wrong on inflation.”Referring to recent economic data showing higher consumer prices, Jones said: “If they [the Fed] treat these numbers, which were material events, they were very material, if they treat them with nonchalance, I think it’s just a green light to bet heavily on every inflation trade.” He further opined:If they say, ‘We’re on path, things are good,’ then I would just go all in on the inflation trades. I’d probably buy commodities, buy crypto, buy gold.On the other hand, Jones predicted: “If they course correct, if they say, ‘We’ve got incoming data, we’ve accomplished our mission or we’re on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,’ then you’re going to get a taper tantrum.” He concluded: “You’re going to get a sell-off in fixed income. You’re going to get a correction in stocks. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s over.”What do you think about Paul Tudor Jones’ comments on bitcoin and the Fed policy?

807,Elon Musk's '50% Clean Energy' Bitcoin Mining Goal Will Be Complicated To Verify,"Jun 14, 2021","On Sunday, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk tweeted that when there’s “confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.” However, there’s a big problem with this goal, as nobody knows exactly how to measure 50% clean energy usage let alone precisely where miners are geographically located.Elon Musk and a number of billionaires have a lot to say these days and it seems Musk can move the price of BTC with a single tweet. It surely was the case when Tesla first accepted bitcoin (BTC) for electric car purchases at Tesla.After that announcement, BTC’s price jumped by $10K seeing one of the largest daily candles in its lifetime. Then when Musk tweeted that bitcoin wouldn’t be accepted and Tesla cited environmental concerns, the price dropped significantly. Sunday’s tweet boosted BTC prices by 9% and the price has inched past the psychological $40K region.Despite the good intentions, it’s hard to say how Musk will accomplish his goal of figuring out whether or not the bitcoin mining ecosystem is using 50% clean energy. Some studies indicate the goal could be already met as researchers have been looking into the number of miners who leverage renewables for quite some time now.Musk may want to read the report published by Coinshares in June 2019, which shows 74.1% of the bitcoin mining industry is “heavily” driven by renewable energy sources. Additionally, Coinshares published a report on the same subject the year prior, and found the percentage of renewable energy-dependent miners was around 77.8%.Global asset manager Ark Invest Management explained in mid-May that concerns over the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption are “misguided.” Even John Lennon’s son detailed that Bitcoin’s use of energy was a silly argument compared to the carbon footprint that’s tied to consumerism. Moreover, Bitcoin.com News is still asking: Where are all these environmentalists getting their electrical data from anyway?Well, it seems most critiques have been leveraging data derived from Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) and the index provided by digiconomist.net. Both metrics show large discrepancies (between each site) to this very day and in December 2020, Bitcoin.com News was told at the time the “CBECI map hasn’t been updated for some time now.” These discrepancies and the notation that data wasn’t (at least in December 2020) being updated regularly, could be problematic for analysts.The reason this discrepancy was highlighted in the first place by the CBECI representative was because of the website’s claims that 65% of the hashrate was located in China. This data point was disputed in July 2020, when research from Bitooda noted that only 50% of the global hashrate stemmed from China.Despite all the increased hashrate in North America and all the Western countries purchasing thousands of mining rigs over the last six months, on June 14, 2021, CBECI data still shows 65.08% of the BTC hashrate is in China. Pool statistics further show Foundry USA has captured a lot more hashrate in recent times, gathering 4.3% of the global hashrate on Monday.How much hashrate is located in China has been contested for a while now and in mid-April 2021 this fact was highlighted by the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics.io, Nic Carter. On April 21, Carter further explained how hard it is to estimate hashrate percentage drops.Meanwhile, Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor has been discussing the Bitcoin Mining Council on Twitter and noted the group will meet this week, on Wednesday. Despite the good intentions for this idea, people are still skeptical of the concept and wonder if it even matters.“On Wednesday, you are all invited to meet with members of the Bitcoin Mining Council to discuss the latest on bitcoin Mining, the energy debate, network dynamics, China mining policy, North American mining developments, tech trends & industry outlook,” Saylor tweeted.North America may have around 10% to 15% of the global hashrate, but that’s awfully small in contrast to the majority of miners worldwide. However, the latest crackdown news stemming from Beijing may push the global industry of miners toward renewable consumption anyway.Lastly, there are lots of miners worldwide and we do have a few maps published by Coinshares and others that show some locations where mining facilities are located. Some mining operations are very open to publicly disclosing where they are located, while others are secretive and will not disclose such information.If one cannot truly estimate where all the bitcoin miners in the world are located, then how do we know if 50% clean energy is being used? If we trust the reports, studies and information we have today, the 50% mark may be already met. Although, with the number of discrepancies and hard-to-track data points mentioned in this article, we may never know the exact number of miners using clean energy or know exactly where they are located.What do you think about Elon Musk’s intentions to have Tesla accept bitcoin again once miners cross the 50% clean energy threshold? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

808,"Analyst Claims Bitcoin Will Break $40K Threshold, S2F Audit Shows BTC Could Tackle $85K by Year's End","Jun 14, 2021","Bitcoin prices have been range-bound and consolidating for quite some time but jumped over 9% in the last 24 hours after Elon Musk’s tweet on Sunday. A number of crypto analysts are still unsure about bitcoin’s future price while a few expect a rebound from last month’s lows. One market report notes that bitcoin will likely climb back up “the stock to flow line in the coming months” leading to a price of around $85K before the year’s end.Elon Musk’s tweet — that said Tesla would accept bitcoin again if the energy used to process transactions was at least 50% renewables — lifted bitcoin’s (BTC) price over 9% as the crypto asset neared the $40K range again. Alex Kuptsikevich, Fxpro senior financial analyst explained in a note to Bitcoin.com News that there’s been a lot of newfound excitement in the world of cryptocurrency lately.“The crypto market is experiencing another phase of excitement following the positive decision by El Salvador’s parliament to include Bitcoin in the country’s official options of payment,” Kuptsikevich stressed in his note. “It is hard to underestimate this precedent on a global scale, which is why we are now witnessing such strong positive price momentum. Investors, who until recently had been putting off their purchases, are entering the market.” Kuptsikevich continued by adding:Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been adding 13% and changing hands for $39,500. Thus, the benchmark cryptocurrency is once again trying to rush the $40K threshold. The success of this test of local highs will define the short-term prospects of the crypto market as a whole. The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours increased by $126 billion. It is very likely that if the threshold is successfully overcome, we will see a new buying momentum, which will push the first cryptocurrency to the area of $42-$44K.Another market update authored by Decentrader sees the leading crypto asset attempting to turn things around. There’s also a chance BTC could smash new all-time highs this year according to Decentrader’s analysis coupled with the stock-to-flow (S2F) price model.“The fact that price has now spent several weeks below the 200DMA is not a bullish sign,” Decentrader’s analysis notes. “However, [closing] above the 200DMA and 128DMA would bring a lot of confidence back into the market,” Decentrader researcher Philip Swift added.Decentrader leverages a few indicators like SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), an Active Addresses Sentiment Indicator, and stock-to-flow (S2F) divergence. What is interesting about Stock to Flow right now is how far price has moved away from the Stock to Flow line.“The divergence tool at the bottom of the Stock to Flow chart shows the extent to which price is moving either side of the stock to flow level. On the chart [above] we see price is trending below the stock to flow line and has only ever been this far away from it four times previously in Bitcoin’s entire history,” Swift explained.The Decentrader researcher Swift highlighted that after each time in 2012, 2013, and 2017 the price of BTC rebounded remarkably from significant drops to rise back to the S2F level. “The last time was in the 2017 bull run when price was at $1,900 before rallying up to $5000 in the following 6 weeks,” Swift said. The Decentrader analyst insists: While we may not rally so hard and fast this time, fundamentally nothing has changed with how Bitcoin works, nothing is broken, we are just experiencing a lot of bad media coverage after a strong rally at the start of the year. So we may well see price make its way back up to the stock to flow line in the coming months. This would mean new all-time highs for BTC before the end of this year, as the Stock to Flow line is currently sitting at $85,000. Decentrader’s and Kuptsikevich’s BTC price outlook is a lot different than those who are feeling bearish about crypto markets. Investment bank JPMorgan Chase and its group of analysts think that a bearish price breakdown could be in bitcoin’s future. Researchers at JPMorgan Chase noted “an unusual development and a reflection of how weak bitcoin demand is at the moment from institutional investors.” In another report, JPMorgan noted that “similarly situated, smaller nations,” may follow El Salvador’s trend.Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange explained to Bitcoin.com in an investor’s note that bitcoin’s options market shows a 30% chance of BTC closing at $50K by the end of July.“After a volatile week, Bitcoin has bounced back and is trading close to $39,500 on the spot. Market sentiment remains cautious as traders continue to pay a premium for downside protection on the monthly and quarterly maturities,” Balani said. “On the weekly and bi-weekly maturities though, the Call IVs have started to rise and approach those of Puts. Options market is pricing close to a 30% chance that Bitcoin will be close to $50,000 by the end of July and a 15% chance that it will be close to $30,000 for the same maturity,” Balani added.What do you think about the recent bitcoin market outlook from the analysts monitoring these crypto markets? Do you envision bitcoin rebounding back to all-time highs again? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

809,A Look at How Second Life's Linden Dollars Helped Kickstart Bitcoin's Value,"Jun 14, 2021","When people think about bitcoin’s past they sometimes refer to subjects like Mt Gox, the Silk Road, or the famous pizza transaction. Although, people often forget that the online virtual world Second Life played an important role during the Bitcoin network’s early years. In fact, some large Linden dollar (L$) holders who swapped their virtual tokens for bitcoin may be crypto millionaires today. Today almost everyone knows what bitcoin is, as the crypto asset has gained a lot of attention and notoriety over the last ten years. During the last decade, the network effect has gathered steam and bitcoin can be swapped for nearly every fiat currency in the world. Back in the early days, this wasn’t the case, even when a few popular exchanges like Mt Gox and New Liberty Standard operated. The first known fiat transaction was attributed to Martti Malmi (Sirius) when he sold 5,050 BTC for $5.02 using Paypal.During these nascent times, a few fiat currencies were trading with bitcoin. At this time, Second Life’s Linden dollars (L$) were also exchanged for large sums of bitcoin as well. Linden dollars are featured in the virtual world called Second Life, a game developed by Linden Lab in 2003. When bitcoin was kickstarting into higher gears in 2010 through 2013, Second Life’s L$ and the virtual world also saw rapid growth. Second Life’s virtual economy met Satoshi’s creation in April 2011, back when the company Virwox allowed L$ and BTC trading pairs.Bitcoin had a fascinating relationship with Second Life users because L$ could be exchanged for fiat, which gave BTC an alternative fiat gateway in the early days. Not only did the two virtual currencies form a symbiotic relationship, but it also caused people to speculate on which virtual asset was better. After the now-defunct Virwox invoked BTC pairs with L$, it also opened the floodgates for Second Life’s virtual economy in 2012 through 2013. During this time of Second Life’s bustling growth, speculators actually argued that Linden Dollars could become “real money” and a legitimate virtual economy. Additionally, the relationship between BTC and L$ caused people to think money laundering was involved with these two trading pairs. With Virwox, a bitcoin trader could swap in and out of the L$ economy but also access C$, OMC, EUR, USD, GBP, and CHF. A study in 2012 authored by Robert Stokes claims the relationship between Linden Dollars and bitcoin increased “virtual money laundering.” The paper stressed that the ability to launder smaller sums of illicit money through virtual currencies like BTC and L$ presented a problem for law enforcement. Stokes’s paper suggests a “method of incorporating the Linden Dollar and bitcoin within the anti-money laundering framework.”Bitcoin’s relationship with Second Life and L$ faded a few years later, but definately shared the stage with each other on many occasions. In 2013, Quartz columnist Sam Williams wrote about how he sold all his L$ for bitcoin. Like most stories involving BTC trades for L$ on Virwox, the trading experience sounded horrific. Anyone who used Virwox back then understood that the user interface (UI) was an awful experience. Williams, however, did end up acquiring a tenth of BTC for 5,000 L$ at the time. The conversion rate on June 13, 2021, for a single Linden dollar is $0.00313, which means if Williams kept his L$ instead, he could have traded it for $15.63 today. Ars Technica author Timothy B. Lee wrote about L$ and BTC trading pairs in July 2012 as well, back when BTC touched a high of $9 per unit.Tech author Wagner James Au also penned an article about bitcoin (BTC) in July 2012, when he explained that bitcoiners were buying over $650K in L$ per month using Virwox. Whoever purchased the L$ sold 93,433 BTC or $3.3 billion for $650K worth of L$ or $2031 USD worth of the Second Life currency in 30 days.James Au also laughed at bitcoin three years later when he said the L$ daily transaction rate was larger than BTC’s 100,000 confirmed transactions per day recorded in 2015. James Au’s 2015 editorial said that BTC is “lauded weekly in the tech and mainstream press for the last 4-5 years.” James Au’s oped criticized: With over $400 million invested in Bitcoin-related startups since 2012 — is still used only about 100K times a day. This isn’t to say Linden Dollars are superior to Bitcoin — which after all, are a virtual currency intrinsically tied to a social game MMO platform. However, after all that hype, you’d think Silicon Valley would be quick to have the same skepticism for Bitcoin as they did for Second Life after it failed to deliver on its promises in 2006-2008.Of course, nowadays bitcoin is lauded almost every other day in the headlines and there’s a lot more than just $400 million invested in crypto startups today. Second Life’s L$ has faded into obscurity, while bitcoin has propelled itself into the limelight reaching $64K per coin this year. After BTC reached $20K in 2017, mainstream media pundits said the crypto asset was “dead,” and they claimed no publicly-traded company would add BTC to its balance sheet. Skeptics also never thought a country like El Salvador would adopt bitcoin as legal tender either. As for Second Life’s Linden dollars in 2021, nobody believes L$ could actually become a real economy at all these days. We also don’t know how many others, besides Quartz columnist Sam Williams, sold all their Linden dollars for bitcoin, but it’s likely a number of people did swap L$ for BTC and profited a great deal. What do you think about the fascinating relationship between bitcoin and Linden dollars? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

810,"Johannesburg Stock Exchange Rejects Bitcoin ETF Application, Cites Lack of Regulatory Framework","Jun 14, 2021","South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has rejected a request by the asset management firm, Sygnia, to list a new bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In justifying its rejection of the latest proposal by Sygnia, the JSE cites the “lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies as the reason.”Meanwhile, a report suggests that while Sygnia was not expecting “an immediate acceptance of the bitcoin ETF”, company executives still did not anticipate such “a quick rejection.” Instead, in her reaction to the JSE’s decision, Sygnia founder and executive chairman Magda Wierzycka said:We expected the JSE to put in it ‘file 13’ and if and when they were ready that Sygnia would be the first in the queue.In addition, Wierzycka says the bitcoin ETF “would have attracted attention, and in turn money, to the JSE.” In the meantime, the same report reveals that this is the second time the JSE has rejected a similar application by Sygnia. In 2017, Sygnia unsuccessfully tried to list the world’s first cryptocurrency ETF on the JSE. At the time, a former executive with the exchange, John Burke, suggested the JSE “was not ready to approve cryptocurrency listings.”In a different report, Wierzycka is quoted expressing her belief in bitcoin’s staying power. She also discusses how the crypto asset’s price has been manipulated by “one very powerful and influential individual.” She said:The volatility we have seen is a—clearly unexpected—function of what I would call market manipulation by Elon Musk. If that happens to a listed company he would be investigated and severely sanctioned by the SEC.Meanwhile, following the South African Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG)’s release of a new position paper on cryptocurrencies, it is now unclear if the JSE’s rejection of the bitcoin ETF is going to stand. In a new position paper on cryptocurrencies (which published just after the JSE rejection of the ETF proposal) the IFWG recommends the regulation of the crypto ecosystem.If accepted, the IFWG recommendations will see South Africa becoming one of the first countries in Africa to regulate cryptocurrencies. Regulation of cryptocurrencies, in turn, will likely force the JSE into revisiting its decision to reject Sygnia’s request.What do you think of the JSE’s rejection of Sygnia’s bitcoin ETF application? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

811,"Dutch Official Predicts Crypto Market Crash, Says 'the Netherlands Must Ban Bitcoin Now'","Jun 13, 2021","The director of the Netherlands’ Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, a part of the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, has predicted “The ultimate collapse of the crypto bubble.” He urges the government to ban bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies immediately. However, the country’s finance minister disagrees that banning cryptocurrency is right for the country.Pieter Hasekamp, director of CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), published an article on the official CPB website Friday titled “The Netherlands must ban bitcoin.” The article was originally written for publication in the daily newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad.The CPB is a part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. Its director is appointed by the minister, in consultation with other members of the government. However, the CPB is fully independent as far as the contents of its work are concerned, the bureau’s website states. As the country’s central planning office, the CPB does scientific research aimed at contributing to the economic decision-making process of politicians and policymakers.Hasekamp has been the director of the CPB since March 1, 2020. He was previously director-general for tax affairs at the Ministry of Finance and director of health insurance at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.After examining the use of cryptocurrencies as money, he concluded:Cryptocurrencies are unsuitable as a unit of account and means of payment outside the criminal circuit; its use as a store of value is based on the hope that cryptocurrencies will one day replace real money. But that’s not going to happen.The director continued: “Cryptocurrencies are essentially neither money nor a financial product, but an example of what Nobel laureate Robert Shiller calls a contagious narrative: a contagious story in which people believe because other people believe in it. Gresham’s law is replaced by Newton’s law: what goes up, must come down.”Shiller, however, recently said that he was considering getting active in the BTC market. Calling Bitcoin “an impressive technology,” the Nobel laureate said he has been tempted to get into cryptocurrency.Nonetheless, Director Hasekamp emphasized:The ultimate collapse of the crypto bubble is inevitable … The Netherlands must ban bitcoin now.He further said that “Several countries are now taking steps to curb the crypto hype, due to harmful consequences – fraud, criminal use, gambling addiction, financial instability, not to mention the enormous energy waste in production.”The director warned that the Netherlands is lagging behind other countries in its attempts to regulate cryptocurrency trading platforms.Hasekamp noted: “cautious regulation can also backfire: it legitimizes crypto as a bona fide financial product. Recent developments show that it is time to act: the longer we wait, the greater the negative consequences of the eventual crash.” He concluded, “The ultimate step is a total ban on production, trading and even possession of cryptocurrencies.”However, the Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, reportedly said Friday that banning is not the solution for the Netherlands right now. While acknowledging the CPB director’s concerns, the finance minister believes that it is better to monitor the crypto industry. He was quoted as saying:My observation now is that that is more effective than a total ban in the Netherlands.What do you think about the CPB director’s ban recommendation? Let us know in the comments section below.

812,Christine Lagarde Reaffirms ECB's Crypto Policy as Bitcoin Becomes Legal Tender in El Salvador,"Jun 13, 2021","The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, has shared her view on El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender. She confirmed that the central bank’s policy on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has not changed.ECB President Christine Lagarde has shared her view last week on El Salvador’s move to make bitcoin legal tender. The country passed a bill last week making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.Lagarde first admitted that since she left the International Monetary Fund (IMF), she is “no longer familiar with the situation in El Salvador.” The ECB chief noted, “I know that it is a country that is under the IMF program.”While pointing out that “the issue of having dual tender in a particular economy is a difficult one,” Lagarde confirmed:That certainly does not change our approach to crypto assets and to regulations, supervision, and proper classification that they should be under to avoid misinformation and misleading representations.After El Salvador passed the bill making bitcoin legal tender, the IMF said that it saw legal and economic issues regarding this move. A BIS official also commented recently that it is an “interesting experiment” but it does not change the BIS’s view on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, insisting that BTC fails a means of payment test.Lagarde warned last month that cryptocurrencies are prone to money laundering and have no intrinsic value. In January, she said: “It’s a highly speculative asset, which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.”What do you think about Lagarde’s comments on bitcoin?

813,JPMorgan Warns of Incoming Bitcoin Bear Market Citing 'Unusual Development' in Futures,"Jun 13, 2021","Investment bank JPMorgan Chase has warned of a further bitcoin price decline, expecting an incoming bear market. The bank’s analysts look at the trend in bitcoin futures and see “an unusual development and a reflection of how weak bitcoin demand is at the moment from institutional investors.” However, a number of people disagree with this analysis.JPMorgan Chase analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, warned of an incoming bitcoin bear market in a note to investors last week.The analysts looked at bitcoin futures which have been trading at a discount to the spot price, known as backwardation. “We believe that the return to backwardation in recent weeks has been a negative signal pointing to a bear market,” they wrote, adding:This is an unusual development and a reflection of how weak bitcoin demand is at the moment from institutional investors that tend to use regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure to bitcoin.JPMorgan’s analysts affirmed that their outlook for bitcoin was negative. They pointed out another sign that worries them — the sharp decrease in bitcoin’s market share of the total crypto market, which fell from 60% to about 40% between April and May. The analysts call this decline in the BTC market share “a bearish signal carrying some echoes of the retail-investor-driven froth of December 2017.”They see similarities between the current situation and the bitcoin crash in 2018 when investors rushed into cryptocurrencies as they boomed in 2017 and mass exited as the prices plunged during 2018. The bitcoin futures curve was also in backwardation for most of 2018 when the price of BTC dropped from about $15K to $4K, JPMorgan detailed.Some people took to Twitter to disagree with JPMorgan’s analysis. Twitter account DTC Crypto Trading, for example, wrote: “So the ‘analyst’ at JPMorgan says that backwardation on BTC while price is moving up is a sign of the bear market. No clue who ‘analyzes’ this but they might want to hire better people. Pretty much every time BTC has had a sustained period of backwardation, price moved up.” Several people agreed with this analysis.Meanwhile, rival investment banks are seeing huge demand from institutional investors. Even the CEO of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, recently admitted that institutional clients want exposure to bitcoin. Goldman Sachs has repeatedly said that it is seeing huge institutional demand for BTC, noting that the cryptocurrency has become a new asset class. Morgan Stanley is already offering some bitcoin investments to wealthy clients due to the high demand for the crypto asset.Bitcoin’s price moved higher Sunday afternoon following clarification by Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating that his company will resume accepting the cryptocurrency “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.” At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin sits at $38,874 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets.What do you think about the bitcoin prediction by JPMorgan?

814,Elon Musk Says Tesla Will Resume Accepting Bitcoin When Miners Confirm 50% Clean Energy Usage,"Jun 13, 2021","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that when there is “confirmation of reasonable (about 50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend,” his electric car company will start accepting bitcoin for payments again.Tesla CEO Elon Musk talked about when Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin for payments Sunday. He wrote:When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.Tesla began accepting bitcoin for car payments in March. Musk confirmed at the time that any BTC received will not be converted into fiat currencies. This followed the company’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring that it had purchased bitcoin worth $1.5 billion. In April, its bitcoin stash was worth $2.5 billion.However, Tesla suspended accepting bitcoin as a payment option in May, citing environmental issues. Musk then met with North American bitcoin miners to discuss using renewable energy in mining. The miners subsequently set up Bitcoin Mining Council. Nonetheless, Musk confirmed that Tesla did not sell any bitcoins due to environmental concerns.The company did sell some coins during the first quarter of this year, however, before the mining issues surfaced. During Tesla’s Q1 2021 earnings announcement, Master of Coin Zachary Kirkhorn revealed that the company trimmed its BTC position by 10%. Musk explained at the time that the BTC sale was “essentially to prove liquidity of bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.”Musk’s Sunday tweet was in response to allegations cited in a Cointelegraph article. Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka alleged that the Tesla technoking had manipulated the bitcoin market and the SEC should investigate him. The South African billionaire believes that Musk knowingly pumped bitcoin with the announcement that Tesla was going to accept BTC and then “sold a big part of his exposure at the peak.”However, Musk denied the allegations. “This is inaccurate,” he tweeted, reiterating his earlier explanation of why Tesla sold some bitcoins:Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.What do you think about Elon Musk’s comments on bitcoin and when Tesla will resume accepting the cryptocurrency for payments?

815,"Bitcoin Mining Council Goes Live, Elon Musk Gets Sidelined","Jun 13, 2021","The Bitcoin Mining Council has gone live, launching its own website detailing its members and the mission statement of the organization. The council originated as a closed organization, but they are now allowing any miner to join. While Michael Saylor gets a founding member status, the site states Elon Musk has “no role” in the council.The Bitcoin Mining Council, an organization born out of worries regarding Bitcoin’s energy consumption, launched officially yesterday. On the website, the council presents its mission statement. It also explains the plan to tackle the task of addressing bitcoin energy worries. The site states:The mandate of the Bitcoin Mining Council is to promote transparency, share best practices, and educate the public on the benefits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining.To achieve this, individual members need to provide accurate energy numbers. Miners and mining companies are traditionally reluctant to share these statistics in the open. The council made its debut last month when Michael Saylor hosted a meeting of a group of several miners in America. The objective of the meeting was to point bitcoin mining in a cleaner, greener direction. However, the Bitcoin Mining Council states that:Bitcoin’s energy usage is a feature, not a bug, and provides tremendous network security. By providing a voluntary disclosure forum, miners can decide to share their energy sources, in hopes of promoting transparency.This focus clearly leaves behind the green push that originated it. While the Bitcoin Mining council has 9 members including Microstrategy, the site states any miner can join.The Bitcoin Mining Council states Michael Saylor is one of the “key members of the BMC, both as a facilitator and Bitcoin supporter.” However, Elon Musk, whose activity was key to its establishment, was sidelined. The site declares:Elon Musk has no role at the BMC. The extent of his involvement was joining an educational call with a group of North American companies to discuss Bitcoin mining.While Elon Musk was not involved in the creation of the organization, he drove public attention to Bitcoin’s energy consumption. Musk called Bitcoin’s energy footprint “insane” in one of his tweets. Tesla, the vehicle company where Musk is CEO, also stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment method due to environmental concerns. This was a key circumstance that started a downtrend in the market. All of this enticed miners to take the subject seriously. In any case, the backpedaling seems to go hand in hand with Musk’s latest Twitter divorce with Bitcoin.What do you think about the Bitcoin Mining Council? Tell us in the comments section below.

816,Bitcoinization: JPMorgan Notes 'Similarly Situated' Countries Could Make Bitcoin Legal Tender Like El Salvador,"Jun 12, 2021","JPMorgan struggles to “see any tangible economic benefits associated with adopting bitcoin as a second form of legal tender.” Commenting on El Salvador’s bitcoinization, JPMorgan did not rule out that the country’s move to make the cryptocurrency legal tender may be “the beginning of a broader trend among similarly situated, smaller nations.”Investment bank JPMorgan released a report Friday titled “The Bitcoinization of El Salvador.” The country’s congress passed the bill making bitcoin legal tender on Wednesday, becoming the first nation to do so.JPMorgan described: “El Salvador recently passed legislation making bitcoin legal tender, and will attempt to implement a bimonetary system with the U.S. dollar as the primary unit of account but mandating bitcoin be accepted as payment for all economic activity.”The investment bank added that “As with dollarization in the early-2000s, this move does not seem motivated by stability concerns, but rather is growth-oriented,” elaborating:It is difficult to see any tangible economic benefits associated with adopting bitcoin as a second form of legal tender, and it may imperil negotiations with the IMF.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already voiced concerns regarding El Salvador’s move to make bitcoin legal tender, citing legal and economic issues. El Salvador is currently seeking a billion-dollar loan from the IMF.An official with the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has also expressed doubt in El Salvador’s bitcoin law, calling it an “interesting experiment,” but emphasizing that the BIS does not see that bitcoin can function as a means of payment.The JPMorgan report further points out that there are questions as to how bitcoin will be treated by larger economies when it is legal tender in El Salvador. The bank warned that any treatment changes “would arguably be an unintended consequence of laws and regulations that significantly predate, and understandably did not anticipate cryptocurrency.” Nonetheless, the bank said:Those moves may be complicated if this is the beginning of a broader trend among similarly situated, smaller nations.After El Salvador passed the bill to make bitcoin legal tender, President Nayib Bukele said the country will be mining BTC using energy from volcanoes. He said it will be “very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos.”Do you think other countries will follow El Salvador’s example and make bitcoin legal tender?

818,"Stock-to-Flow Creator Says '$288K Still in Play,' Mike McGlone Sees an 'Ace up Bitcoin's Sleeve'","Jun 12, 2021","The popular Twitter account and creator of the bitcoin stock-to-flow (S2F) price model explained that “$288K [is] still in play.” Meanwhile, data from the exchange Deribit shows there’s 425 bitcoin call options with a strike price of $200K set for December 31, 2021.On June 12, 2021, while bitcoin (BTC) prices have been hovering just above the $35K zone, the popular Twitter account Plan B (@100trillionusd) told his 553,000 followers that six-figure bitcoin prices are still intact. Plan B is a pseudonym and he published the stock-to-flow (S2F) price model in March 2019. He also updated the S2F model to another version called the stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) model.Twelve days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on how Plan B said his S2FX model was “intact.” Plan B has always shown confidence in his model but when he last tweeted about the S2FX being intact, he invoked a poll on Twitter. The pseudonym asked his followers if they thought the S2F model would break or will it turn out to be an excellent buy signal. When the poll completed more than 53% of the 31,824 votes said it was a “buy signal.”Plan B’s statements on Saturday still show confidence in the model and even six-figure price targets. “$288K still in play,” Plan B said on Twitter. “It would really surprise me if bitcoin would not touch the black S2FX model line this phase. Regardless of current volatility, yellow green and blue dots will be (much) higher than red orange dots,” the analyst added.A Twitter account responded to Plan B’s tweet on Saturday and asked: “What gives this confidence given the large downwards deviation from the model at the moment? Is it onchain analytics?”Plan B responded and noted that things look awfully similar to 2013 and 2017. Plan B noted:Deviation is not much different from 2013 (S2F ~10) or 2017 (S2F ~25), just the usual inertia after a halving.Plan B is not the only person expecting six-figure prices as data from Deribit’s call options records show more than 400 contracts with an expiry set for the last day of 2021 for a price above $200K per BTC.Senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, also spoke about bitcoin’s scarcity and touched upon the next halving on Saturday.“Bitcoin $100,000 Has Bullish Ace Up Its Sleeve: Declining Supply — This year follows a cut in Bitcoin supply, making the price more likely to appreciate if past patterns hold,” McGlone tweeted, while also sharing a chart of the diminishing BTC supply. The diminishing bitcoin supply is a stark contrast to the $8 trillion recorded on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet for the first time in history on June 10, 2021.Meanwhile, some skeptics as usual disagree with people like Plan B or Mike McGlone as one person responded to McGlone’s optimistic outlook. “Don’t marry the trade, it’s in a bear market,” the individual replied to McGlone on Twitter.What do you think about the six-figure prices “still in play” for bitcoin according to Plan B or the 400+ contracts betting the price will be $200K by the year’s end?

He calls El Salvador’s move to make the cryptocurrency legal tender “an interesting experiment.”Benoit Coeure, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), commented on El Salvador’s move to make bitcoin legal tender Friday. He said at the launch of a regulatory research hub at the Bank of England (BoE):El Salvador, that is an interesting experiment indeed.A member of the BIS executive committee, Benoit Coeure was appointed head of the bank’s innovation hub in 2020. He was previously a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB). From 2013 to 2019, he chaired the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures.El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as its national currency, alongside the U.S. dollar, after its congress passed a bill to make the cryptocurrency legal tender Wednesday. The country is now exploring mining using energy from volcanoes.Coeure emphasized:We have been clear at the BIS that we don’t see bitcoin as having passed the test of being a means of payments. Bitcoin is a speculative asset and should be regulated as such.The BIS official is not the only one that has voiced concerns regarding bitcoin being legal tender in El Salvador. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Thursday that “Adoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues.”Meanwhile, many countries, including the U.S., are increasing their efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies. This week, financial regulators for major economies proposed additional capital rules for banks holding crypto assets.What do you think about Benoit Coeure’s comments on bitcoin in El Salvador?

822,Texas Senator Claims People Are Flocking to Bitcoin Because US Is on 'the Verge of an Inflation Crisis',"Jun 11, 2021","This week the United States senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, appeared on the Fox News television broadcast Hannity and discussed the leading crypto asset bitcoin. Cruz told Hannity he believes people are investing in bitcoin because they believe America is on the verge of an inflation crisis.Following negative statements about bitcoin from U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, the Republican senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, gave his opinion about bitcoin this week. Cruz appeared on the Fox News television show Hannity with the conservative host Sean Hannity. The Texas senator had a lot to say about Joe Biden and explained that he thinks the Biden administration is undermining the American economy and foreign policy.“If you look at Biden’s foreign policy and you break the world into two groups, our friends and our enemies,” Cruz said during the interview with Hannity, “What does Biden do? He undermines and weakens our friends systematically over and over and over again.”In addition to discussing foreign policy, Russia, and Nord Stream 2, the conversation turned to cryptocurrencies. “Okay, you’ve been hearing all about it,” says Sean Hannity. “Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, what is it? Why is it so big? What is Bitcoin? What is blockchain? What is doggy coin?” Hannity asked.The host of the Fox News broadcast further said that he’s been “studying this and debating this with friends for probably hundreds of hours,” in regard to crypto assets. The political commentator also added that he is “not in any way offering financial advice.”Senator Cruz also talked about bitcoin and noted that he believes the crypto asset is seeing mass adoption because people are frightened about rising inflation and the Biden administration’s proposed spending.“I think part of the reason we’re seeing people go to Bitcoin is because we’re on the verge of an inflation crisis and Joe Biden has proposed seven trillion dollars in new spending,” Cruz stressed during the interview. “We’re seeing inflation, which we’re seeing lumber going up, homes going up, oil going up, gasoline going up, energy going up, commodities going up. And I think people are going to Bitcoin as a hedge against that.”What do you think about senator Ted Cruz and the political commentator Sean Hannity discussing bitcoin on Fox News?

823,DeFire (CWAP) Token Is Now Listed on Bitcoin.com Exchange,"Jun 11, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. Bitcoin.com Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of CWAP, being available to trade on the 11th June 2021 at 10:00AM UTC. CWAP was created by the DeFire team, as the native currency which sets the ‘right’ economic incentives via its platform. CWAP will start trading with USDT and BTC pairs.DeFire is an order router across decentralized execution venues, or in layman terms, a DEX aggregator. What does it all mean? DeFire provides optimal order execution across the universe of decentralized exchanges and other order routing services. In other words, DeFire is in the business of offering the best rate for DeFi trading. The nature of value dynamics within the DeFi ecosystem flows from order flow originators (casual traders, institutional traders, wallets with DeFi facilities, etc.) to execution venues (DEX’s and lending platforms) as it is up to the trading agents where they choose to send their order flow. DeFire algorithmically optimizes this selection procedure, bringing market efficiency to the wider DeFi ecosystem within given layer-1 networks. DeFire’s value offering, however, is much wider than that. The team plans on deploying a game-changing DEX in the coming months. The actual parameters behind the routing optimization routines will be defined in a series of blog posts that will come out in the near future and further calibrated as the parameters are set in stone in the smart contracts. This, however, is subject to change as the project will be moving towards decentralizing the governance by introducing the DeFire DAO, where the community of CWAP stakers will be able to introduce proposals for changing system parameters and vote upon them. To explain how the project, and the ecosystem works, one must look into three different actors, and what each of them have to do with CWAP, DeFire’s native currency. These refer to the following: DeFire serves as a middleware between traders and other orderflow originators who seek best, and third-party execution venues who offer liquidity against orders sent their way.Danish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com Exchange, shared his views on DeFire, both as the CEO of the exchange, and as an advisor to the DeFire team: “I believe both projects align in ways which will lead to further collaboration and opportunities for our communities, the team behind DeFire is built with an array of incredibly talented individuals who are offering top class facilities for the Cardano network and the expanding DeFi sphere.” Chaudhry continues on by saying; “We’re very excited to see how DeFire, via their CWAP will continue to empower their vision for the future of DEX solutions, and gain further outreach with our outstanding community at the exchange.”Eric Benz, Chairman of the DeFire Association also expressed his enthusiasm: “We are delighted to list on Bitcoin.com Exchange, one of the world’s most trusted trading venues for digital assets. However, this represents much more than simply a listing for CWAP. We will now work closely with the Bitcoin.com Exchange team to identify synergies within the Cardano DeFi landscape, and leverage our smart order routing technology to their benefit. We look forward to listing on the Bitcoin.com Exchange and working with their team in the future.” About Bitcoin.com ExchangeThe mission of Bitcoin.com Exchange is to empower people from all over the world to trade cryptocurrencies with ease and confidence, from first-time traders to advanced trading professionals. With high liquidity, 24/7 multilingual support and dozens of trading pairs, complemented with a high level of security, we offer an attractive platform for trading any cryptocurrency. Within one year since launch, on average, our exchange has been visited by more than 500K active traders per month, and this number continues to grow as you read this sentence. About DeFireDeFire is currently pursuing a full-stack DEX solution for the Cardano ecosystem that few of its rivals in the space are creating; a low latency smart decentralized order router; as well as offering its facilities to the growing Cardano network and associated rapidly expanding DeFi scene. Execution-wise, DeFire connects to the deepest pools of on-chain liquidity, while also building out their own dedicated liquidity pools. Their staking and liquidity mining mechanisms offer value to their CWAP token holders. Learn more at www.DeFire.fi. This is a press release.

824,Russian Court Bans Websites Explaining How to Trade Bitcoin,"Jun 11, 2021","A court in Russia’s Perm region has decided to block a number of websites describing how to exchange cryptocurrency for fiat cash. Local prosecutors claim the dissemination of this type of information is against the law in Russia as it may facilitate the laundering of illicit funds. The Kungur City Court in the Russian Perm Krai region has upheld a request filed by the Beryozovsky District Prosecutor’s Office to take down several internet sites detailing various methods of cashing out bitcoin. The prosecutors who discovered the crypto platforms insist the publishing of such content violates Russian legislation on combating the legalization of crime proceeds.“It was established that information on methods of cashing out the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was freely available for viewing and using on certain Internet resources,” a press release explained, further noting:Taking into account that the legislation considers the exchange of virtual currencies as a potential involvement in dubious transactions, the prosecutor sent an administrative statement of claim to the court demanding to restrict access to this information.The number of the affected websites as well as their domain names were not disclosed, but Forklog quoted the prosecutor’s office saying that five such requests have been submitted since the beginning of the year. One of the claims, according to the publication, concerns a Youtube video describing ways of exchanging bitcoin for Russian rubles.Access to the websites subject to Kungur City Court’s latest decision will be restricted after the ruling enters into force, the Perm Prosecutor’s Office said without providing any more details. The banned sites will join a growing number of crypto-related outlets that have been taken down by Russian authorities in the past few years.Last August, the Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor blocked a crypto exchange monitoring website, Bestchange.ru, the third time the platform went offline as Bitcoin.com News reported. The popular site helps Russian-speaking users to find the best crypto-fiat exchange rates available. Roskomnadzor’s attempts to blacklist the aggregator started back in 2017.In March 2020, the agency added five crypto websites to its register of banned internet sources. The platforms were offering various services, from crypto exchange to mobile top-ups with bitcoin, and one of them was an information portal. The forum section of the crypto news outlet Bits.media was also targeted.Crypto website operators have in the past successfully challenged some of these censorship measures in Russian courts. In March 2018, the Saint Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 websites publishing information and offering services related to cryptocurrencies. In April of that year, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation overturned a decision to block the Bitcoininfo.ru portal. In May 2019, Roskomnadzor was forced to remove Bestchange.ru from its blacklist, after prosecutors gave up efforts to block the website.What do you think of Russia’s attempts to block crypto-related websites?

With the recent approval of the “Bitcoin Law” proposed by President Nayib Bukele, El Salvador has become the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.Gerry Rice, an IMF spokesman, said during a scheduled press briefing in Washington:Adoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis so we are following developments closely and will continue our consultation with authorities. Crypto assets can pose significant risks and effective regulatory measures are very important when dealing with them.The spokesperson added that the IMF will meet with President Bukele later on Thursday to discuss the recently passed bitcoin law. El Salvador has been in discussions with the IMF seeking a near $1 billion loan.Following the adoption of the bill to make bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador announced that it will be mining bitcoin using energy from volcanoes. “I’ve just instructed the president of La Geo (our state-owned geothermal electric company) to put up a plan to offer facilities for bitcoin mining with very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos. This is going to evolve fast,” said President Bukele.What do you think about the IMF’s concerns about bitcoin being legal tender in El Salvador? Let us know in the comments section below.

827,Senator Warren Calls Out Bitcoin's Energy Consumption — Bitcoiners Bite Back,"Jun 10, 2021","U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies yesterday in a Banking Senate Subcommittee hearing. In the hearing, Warren criticized the energy consumption that Bitcoin and other proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies need to operate. Warren also thinks cryptocurrencies are the “wild west” of investments and called for a regulatory crackdown on the industry. Some on social media were quick to bite back, however, pointing out Warren’s flawed logic and perceived hypocrisy.Senator Elizabeth Warren declared her opinion on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies yesterday in a senate subcommittee hearing. The hearing, titled “Building a stronger Financial System: Opportunities of a central bank digital currency,” served as an opportunity to criticize Bitcoin’s energy consumption and its usage in criminal activities. Warren quickly stated how Bitcoin needed too much energy to settle even one transaction, stressing that:A single Bitcoin transaction uses more energy than a typical US household in a month. I think the estimate is 53 days.But Warren’s critical viewpoint of Bitcoin doesn’t end there. The former Democrat presidential candidate also thinks bitcoin as an investment vehicle is flawed. In an interview on Bloomberg TV, Warren explained Bitcoin was very volatile, being like the “wild west” of investments. She declared:If you were buying stock for speculation you’d be protected from pump and dumps, but not when you are buying Bitcoin; we need to talk with the SEC about that.To Warren, cryptocurrencies are also a tool for criminals to be used in ransomware attacks. An example of this is what happened with the Colonial Pipeline’s system hijack. As a consequence, she is calling for a stricter regulatory oversight on the system. Regarding this call for clampdown, Warren stated:Our regulators and congress are an hour late and a dollar short. We need to catch up with where cryptocurrencies are going.This barrage of criticism towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies made the community quickly move to disregard Senator Warren’s opinions. Ari Paul, CIO of Blocktower Capital, stated Warren’s use of social media was far more harmful to the environment than Bitcoin. He declared:Social media uses more electricity than bitcoin. You could do more for climate change by not tweeting.Kraken’s Dan Held sarcastically proposed canceling Christmas lights due to their energy consumption, citing a report from Phys.org, and another tweet criticized Warren’s hypocritical use of fossil fuel-guzzling private jets — instead of virtual media — to attend meetings.Warren’s statements are the latest of a series of attacks Bitcoin has faced in the last two months. Former President Donald Trump also criticized Bitcoin recently, saying he believes Bitcoin is “kind of a scam” in an interview with Bloomberg last week.What do you think about Senator Elizabeth Warren’s criticism of Bitcoin?

828,How Many People Mined BTC Alongside Satoshi? 2010 Data Shows Bitcoin's Creator Wasn't the Only Mining Whale,"Jun 10, 2021","Throughout 2021, a great number of mysterious whale movements from miners who mined bitcoins in the early days have occurred. This week, 1,000 bitcoin from 2010 were transferred, and the miner has spent 11,000 bitcoin since last year. Old school whale movements like these have made some people assume that decade-old coinbase spends could stem from Satoshi Nakamoto. However, even though estimates say Nakamoto mined over a million bitcoin, many other network participants mined millions of coins as well.On June 9, 2021, an early miner sent 1,000 bitcoin (BTC) stemming from 20 block rewards from 2010 to a myriad of different addresses. Bitcoin.com News has caught this whale six times so far in 2021, spending 6,000 decade-old bitcoin. Further, our newsdesk caught the previous five strings before 2021, when 5,000 decade-old coins were spent in 2020. Ever since we published our investigations it has been assumed by some that the whale might be Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.It is unlikely that the mystery whale is Nakamoto, and even though the inventor mined a million bitcoin, many others were mining alongside the creator’s efforts. Nakamoto likely mined bitcoin in 2010 but a great number of other miners also processed block rewards during Bitcoin’s second year. 3.39 million BTC was mined in 2010 and at this point in time, an individual could still leverage a central processing unit (CPU) to mine bitcoin up until mid-2010. This means a basic computer with a decent CPU could find block rewards out of the 67,920 blocks solved in 2010.In between that time and the latter months of 2010, graphics processing units (GPUs) were utilized to mine bitcoins up until the first quarter of 2011. Between the CPU and GPU period, a lot more people could mine bitcoin alongside the creator, who left the community in December 2010.We also know that Bitcoin’s network mining difficulty was very low during the second year of Bitcoin’s life. Analysts can estimate the total hashrate by calculating specific fields found in coinbase rewards. Essentially, this data includes version, prevblockhash, merkleroot, the timestamp, difficulty target, and nonce.The 3.3 million BTC acquired in 2010 were mined under a network mining difficulty of around 1.18 to 14,484. For comparison, today’s mining difficulty is much larger at 21.05 trillion or a difficulty increase of 145,317,112,385% since 2010.This data indicates that during the first two years the Bitcoin network operated, the difficulty to mine bitcoin was extremely low. The hashrate was very low too at this time, which means a lot more hashpower is used to mine BTC in 2021 than was needed a decade ago.Data shows that in March 2010, the hashrate was around 43 million hashes per second or a grand total of 43.5 megahash per second (MH/s). For comparison, today’s top bitcoin mining rig does around 100 terahash per second (TH/s), which is 100 trillion times higher than the entire hashrate in the spring of 2010. If there were a few hundred people or upwards of a few thousand people mining bitcoin in 2010, the hashrate was only 0.0000436 TH/s. By August 30, 2010, the overall network hashrate jumped to 0.01 TH/s. For five months better solutions toward finding bitcoin and more participants dedicating hashrate to the network caused this swell.We know from forum posts on bitcointalk.org that lots of people were mining bitcoin by July 2010. In December 2009, it was obvious that people were leveraging GPU mining rigs to mine bitcoin and people also knew that ASIC mining was on its way. Satoshi even warned about the “GPU arms race” that year when he said that maybe the community should agree not to rush this type of mining.“We should have a gentleman’s agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as long as we can for the good of the network. It’s much easier to get new users up to speed if they don’t have to worry about GPU drivers and compatibility. It’s nice how anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly equally right now,” Nakamoto said.By the summer of 2010, it was too late and in mid-July, the pseudonymous miner Artforz was rumored to be one of the earliest GPU miners alongside Laszlo Hanyecz. Artforz was seemingly the first to create an entire “farm” of GPU miners.“Artfarm,” as it was called back then, used his private code to mine thousands of bitcoin back in 2010. The infamous Artforz said that he mined 1,700 bitcoin in six days on July 25, 2010. Artforz became a pretty controversial leader in the space and it was claimed in October of 2010 that Artforz controlled roughly 20-30% of the network’s computing power.No one knows who Artforz is but we do know he created the first Scrypt coin called “tenebrix,” which eventually led to Charlie Lee’s invocation of litecoin (LTC). Just like Nakamoto, Artforz disappeared from the scene in the early days of the network. He told the public on August 25, 2011, his “Artfarm” covered less than 1% of the network hashpower due to advances in mining from certain individuals and groups. Between January 2009 and the end of 2010, it is assumed that Nakamoto gathered 1.1 million BTC. Yet between that period (Jan. 2009 to Dec. 2010), over 4.9 million bitcoin was mined into existence which leaves 3.8 million left for other mining participants.After the first quarter of 2011, it started to get tougher for participants leveraging CPU and GPU mining solutions as integrated circuit designs like a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) entered the scene. A miner probably could leverage an FPGA up until Q1 2012 and by then integrated circuit (IC) chips or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) became the dominant force in mining.All this in view, we can say that many others mined bitcoin alongside Satoshi during the creator’s time kickstarting the network, until December 2010. Just because a few thousand BTC from 2010 moved, that doesn’t mean it was Nakamoto. And as far as we know, Bitcoin’s creator has never spent any of the 1.1 million coins they are thought to have mined at that time.What do you think about the mining ecosystem in 2010? How many people do you think mined bitcoin alongside Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

829,"El Salvador to Mine Bitcoin With Energy From Volcanoes: '100% Clean, 100% Renewable, 0 Emissions'","Jun 10, 2021","El Salvador has begun exploring bitcoin mining using energy from its volcanoes, President Nayib Bukele has revealed. “Our engineers just informed me that they dug a new well that will provide approximately 95MW of 100% clean, 0 emissions geothermal energy from our volcanos,” he detailed.El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced on Twitter Wednesday: “I’ve just instructed the president of La Geo (our state-owned geothermal electric company) to put up a plan to offer facilities for bitcoin mining with very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos. This is going to evolve fast.”The president soon followed up with another tweet that says:Our engineers just informed me that they dug a new well that will provide approximately 95MW of 100% clean, 0 emissions geothermal energy from our volcanos. Starting to design a full bitcoin mining hub around it. What you see coming out of the well is pure water vapor.Many bitcoiners welcome President Bukele’s decision to use energy from volcanoes to mine bitcoin, seeing it as a bullish move. Thousands of comments flooded his tweet with tens of thousands of likes and retweets at the time of writing. Among commenters was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who wrote: “Bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy.”Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor opined: “Bitcoin mining is the world’s best technology for converting energy into prosperity.” He added, “Bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy,” tagging Elon musk. Saylor recently hosted a meeting between the Tesla CEO and North American bitcoin miners to discuss mining using renewable energy. The miners agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council.The president first revealed his bitcoin mining plans Wednesday morning on a Twitter Spaces room hosted by Nic Carter as the Salvadoran Congress discussed his bill to make bitcoin legal tender. More than 20,000 people tuned in to listen to the discussions hosted by Carter. The bill subsequently passed with a supermajority.President Bukele was asked if he had any bitcoin mining plans. He mentioned that the country had plans to expand infrastructure and stimulate development around its source of geothermal energy. “On the outskirts of the plants, we want to promote industrial parks where you can set up your factory and you will receive cheap, clean, renewable [energy],” he described. He then suggested bitcoin miners might find these parks ideal given the close proximity to cheap, clean, electricity.Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano commented: “The president of El Salvador is reporting that the country’s engineers have already dug a new well for their zero emissions bitcoin mining facility. This is less than 24 hours since the idea surfaced. Speed kills.”What do you think about El Salvador mining bitcoin with volcanic energy? Let us know in the comments section below.

831,South African Court Submissions Expose Lies and Deceptive Tactics Used to Perpetuate MTI Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme,"Jun 9, 2021","New submissions by a South African regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and liquidators have exposed the web of lies and deceptive tactics that were used by Mirror Trading International (MTI) CEO Johann Steynberg and others to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. In its report filed with the South African court, the regulator also exposes the true extent of losses that were incurred by the bitcoin investment company. For instance, in what the FSCA calls the “first period,” MTI had a “total of nearly 51 bitcoin (that) were deposited with Belize-based forex broker FXChoice, but 22 — or 43% — of these coins were lost by the traders.” However, at this point there was “no multi-level marketing involved.”Nevertheless, this would change in the second period “when Steynberg purportedly introduced a computerized trading bot” that falsely guaranteed returns of 10% each day. The report explained:FX Choice reported to the FSCA that 1,846 bitcoin were deposited with it between January and June 2020, but of this 566 bitcoin (about 30%) were lost. These trading results were completely at odds with the wild claims of success being promoted on social media by MTI. FX Choice subsequently froze the remaining 1,280 bitcoin.In the last period, Steynberg claimed all investors’ bitcoin had been transferred to a new broker, Trade 300. Still, when the FSCA investigated this claim, “it concluded that Trade 300 was a fraudulent creation of Steynberg’s and does not exist as a bona fide brokerage,” according to a report by Moneyweb.Meanwhile, MTI liquidators have similarly submitted “evidence” that exposes the bitcoin investment company’s actual shareholding structure. The liquidators’ position is paraphrased by the Moneyweb report: “Based on the evidence provided by the liquidators, MTI was owned 50-50 by Steynberg and Clynton Marks, who would divvy up 10% of the profits between them every Monday.”However, the liquidators still concede that Steynberg seems to have been the only individual in MTI dealing with a broker in Belize and an India-based server team. “He would supply trading results from the broker to the server team for capture into the back-office system,” the report notes.In the meantime, another director of MTI, Cheri Marks, is facing accusations of using her position in the organization to reward her associates. For instance, Marks is accused of appointing Monica Coetzee to the position of marketing director despite her lack of required qualifications. In addition, Marks is accused of bumping Coetzee’s salary from just over $1000 per month to one BTC per month.Following these proceedings, a Western Cape High Court is now expected to hear arguments by those that want a final liquidation to be granted and those against it. According to a report, these proceedings are scheduled to be heard in the third week of June 2021.What are your thoughts on the latest revelations about MTI’s huge losses and its shareholding structure?

Nubank says it will offer bitcoin investment following its acquisition of brokerage firm Easynvest which offers the trading of Brazil’s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has invested $500 million in the parent company of Nubank, a Brazil-based bitcoin-friendly digital bank, the South American company announced Tuesday. This is part of the bank’s Series G funding round which began in January. The bank said it also raised $250 from other investors.Founded in 2013, Nubank says it has 40 million customers, making it the largest digital bank in the world in terms of the number of clients. With the new investments, Nubank has become “the most valuable digital bank in the world and one of the largest financial institutions in Latin America,” the announcement details. Reuters noted that the new investments give Nubank a $30 billion valuation, which is only slightly less than Banco Santander Brasil SA, Brazil’s no. 3 bank. The publication previously reported that the bank is planning a U.S. stock market listing as soon as this year.The pro-bitcoin Nubank has repeatedly said it will be offering bitcoin investment to customers following the acquisition of Easynvest, a brokerage firm that offers a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nubank received authorization from Brazil’s central bank to purchase Easynvest in May. Last week, the bank rebranded Easynvest to Easynvest by Nubank.The bitcoin ETF offered by Easynvest is QBTC11 by QR Asset Management. It was the first bitcoin ETF approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (CVM). It is listed on the B3 stock exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in Latin America and the second oldest in Brazil.Nubank said Tuesday that it plans to use the money raised to fund its international expansion to Mexico and Colombia, launch new products and services, and hire more employees.What do you think about Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway investing in a bitcoin-friendly bank?

833,Report: Document Shows Specific Bitcoin Miners in Xinjiang Instructed to Shut Down,"Jun 9, 2021","An official notice stemming from the Changji prefecture government in Xinjiang details that officials from the Zhundong Economic-Technological Development Park must instruct bitcoin miners to shut down. China’s province of Xinjiang is a highly concentrated region of bitcoin miners and bitcoin activities at the park must cease by June 9, according to the document. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate has been considerably higher today than last week’s average rate. There’s been a number of reports from China that indicate Chinese government officials haven’t been too keen on the crypto mining sector in recent times. Bitcoin.com News has covered a number of reports tied to the country showing a possible crackdown on bitcoin mining taking place in mainland China.For instance, Huobi and Okex revealed the companies would restrict certain services to Chinese residents and then Btc.top and Hashcow halted services to China. Rumors of “cheap” mining rigs surfaced and talks of a massive exodus of Chinese miners migrating to Central Asia started trending.On Wednesday, Wolfie Zhao from The Block, reported on a notice seen and verified by the publication that indicates a development park shut down solely directed at bitcoin mining operations.“According to the notice seen and verified by The Block, officials in the development park have been instructed to shut down all crypto mining activities under their administration by 2:00 pm China time on Wednesday,” Zhao details in the report. The development park in question happens to be the Zhundong Economic-Technological Development Park.Statistics show that there is a deep concentration of bitcoin miners located in Xinjiang and Sichuan. How much hashpower is located in either region is unknown but many people assume that it is a lot of processing power.Interestingly, the notice obtained by Zhao follows the recent Sichuan energy official’s meeting that planned to discuss bitcoin mining implications in that province. Furthermore, a number of mining companies from China have explained that operations may move abroad if crackdowns persist.Despite the notices and government officials in China talking about bitcoin mining, the network’s overall hashrate has increased a great deal. On June 9, 2021, Bitcoin’s hashrate has ramped up to 180 exahash per second (EH/s) after hovering just above the 150 EH/s range last week.Amusingly, the top pools from China Poolin, F2pool, and Antpool have been battling for the number one position during the last few weeks with a few shuffles for the top spot along the way.Today, Poolin commands 15.2% of the Bitcoin hashrate, F2pool captures 14.5%, and Antpool has roughly 13.1%. The top five pools processing SHA256 blocks on the BTC chain today, are all from China.What do you think about the notice to bitcoin miners operating in Zhundong Economic-Technological Development Park?

834,"Mystery Whale Returns by Moving $35 Million — Miner Transfers 1,000 'Sleeping Bitcoins' from 2010","Jun 9, 2021","Two months after the mystery mining whale from 2010 transferred a string of 20 block rewards with 1,000 bitcoin on March 23, it seemed as though the entity was finished, after spending 10,000 bitcoin total. However, it took 78 days for the whale’s next move, as another 20 blocks from 2010 were transferred on Wednesday after the bitcoin sat idle for more than a decade. Despite the fact that bitcoin’s value is much lower today than a month ago, the mystery whale spent 1,000 bitcoin worth $35 million on Wednesday morning (EST) from 2010 at block height 686,865.Last year and into 2021, Bitcoin.com News has been investigating a mystery whale that spends strings of 2010 block rewards in the same pattern every time the entity transfers coins. The strings are precisely 20 decade-old block rewards that contain 50 bitcoin (BTC) each and are also spent in one block.The last time the old-school whale from Satoshi’s era moved coins was on March 23, 2021. The mining entity has now moved another concession of 20 block rewards from 2010 on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, at block height 686,865.Every block reward spent today was mined back in 2010 between the months of August through October of that year. Each block reward contained 50 BTC and when spent, the coins were consolidated into one address, which at one time held 999.99 BTC.As usual, Bitcoin.com News has been tracking this particular whale entity, and the ‘sleeping bitcoins’ that woke up on Wednesday morning were caught by Btcparser.com. The consolidated address then dispersed the $35 million worth of crypto to a myriad of different addresses.The zombie coins from 2010 spent today followed the exact same pattern as the 10,000 decade-old bitcoins spent prior. The grand total now is 11,000 coins spent since last year when Bitcoin.com News caught the whale’s first awakening.It all started on March 12, 2020. From there October 11, 2020, November 7, 2020, November 8, 2020, December 27, 2020, January 3, 2021 (Bitcoin’s 12th anniversary), January 10, 2021, January 25, 2021, February 28, 2021, March 23, 2021, and then today’s spend.Ever since the bitcoin bull run began, old school whales have been making mysterious moves, but this whale, in particular, has been quite the oddity. In addition to the 1,000 BTC spent on Wednesday, the whale also moved the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) into a consolidated address that contained 1,001 BCH.However, just like the previous patterns, the whale did not transfer the corresponding bitcoinsv (BSV) tokens as those coins still sit idle in their original coinbase addresses. The BCH spent was over $600K at the time of transfer and the BCH was also dispersed to a myriad of different addresses.The crypto community still has no idea who this particular whale from 2010 is but the whale certainly has mined a great number of coins in the early days. It’s also worth noting that the terms “spent” or “spend” in the world of bitcoin, simply mean the transfer from one address to another.The terms “spent” or “spend” do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party like a popular crypto exchange. Although, since the mysterious whale has been moving coins since ‘Black Thursday’ 2020, our onchain analysis at Bitcoin.com News indicates the 11,000 BTC may have been sent to a well-known exchange.What do you think about the mysterious whale from 2010 spending 20 blocks today?

Article 1 states:The purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction, and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons require carrying out.The bill details that the exchange rate between bitcoin and the U.S. dollar “will be freely established by the market” and the “prices may be expressed in bitcoin.”Furthermore, “tax contributions can be paid in bitcoin,” the bill adds, noting: “Exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax, just like any legal tender.” In addition, bitcoin must be accepted as payment by anyone offering goods and services.Article 12 notes that those who “do not have access to the technologies that allow to carry out transactions in bitcoin are excluded from the obligation” to accept bitcoin as payments. “The State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.”Article 14 explains:Before the entry into force of this law, the State will guarantee, through the creation of a trust at the Banco de Desarrollo de EI Salvador (BANDESAL), the automatic and instantaneous convertibility of bitcoin to USD necessary for the alternatives provided by the State.According to the bill: “This decree will take effect ninety days after its publication in the Official Gazette.” The full bill can be found here.What do you think about El Salvador making bitcoin legal tender?

836,Mike Novogratz: Bitcoin Investors Waiting for a New Narrative Shift,"Jun 9, 2021","Mike Novogratz declared institutional investors are waiting for the next narrative shift in a recent interview at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami. The CEO of Galaxy Digital thinks the market is now in a consolidation phase after the price crash last month. Novogratz also commented on what the rise of defi could mean for banking operators in the near future.Galaxy Digital’s CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin is still in a phase of consolidation after the dump in prices experienced last month. According to the entrepreneur, possible investors are waiting for the next shift in the Bitcoin narrative. This new push would entice them to start pumping money into digital assets again. Novogratz explained in an interview with Yahoo Finance that he thinks institutional investors are to blame for the recent tank in prices.Institutional investors were able to accumulate Bitcoin cheap at $9K prices, and with the sudden price hike this year, they had to take profits. Novogratz elaborates:A year later it’s at $60,000 and the urge to ring the cash register is such a deep-seated human urge that that’s what happened … We’ll see a long period of consolidation … and you’re waiting for the new narrative to arrive that brings the next wave of money and I think we’re in one of those periods right now.”Novogratz thinks the new narrative shift is already in the works. A Bitcoin or crypto ETF might bring this new blood to the market. These instruments could push crypto to older Americans, that have been traditionally skeptical of cryptocurrency investments. Galaxy Digital, Novogratz’s company, filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF back in April.Mike Novogratz also commented on the state of defi and how it will affect traditional banking in the near future. For him, the next five years will see the world surprised at the rise of defi. This means that banking services will suffer in comparison, due to the regulations they have to comply with. Defi protocols, on the other hand, are pretty much free to offer whatever yield they want according to their activities. Traditional finance service providers will fight for these to be regulated.In any case, the entrepreneur thinks banks are fighting a losing battle. He stressed:Banks are going to lobby like crazy — less against bitcoin, more against Defi — but bitcoin is the trojan horse to get everything in to digital assets and so revolutions don’t happen without a little bloodshed.What do you think about Mike Novogratz’s thoughts on the market?

837,Bitcoin Keys Cannot be Hacked: Skeptics Question the Official Colonial Pipeline Bitcoin Seizure Story,"Jun 8, 2021","On June 7, the United States Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the “recovery” of 63.70 bitcoin from the funds Colonial Pipeline sent to the hackers. The official story has a number of inconsistencies and federal investigators did not disclose how the FBI was able to confiscate the Darkside gang’s private key.The cryptocurrency space has been discussing the recent law enforcement capture of 63.7 BTC or $2.3 million worth of bitcoin at the time of seizure. There have been issues with the way the story has unfolded and people are skeptical of the official story. Bitcoin.com News reported on Monday, how the Justice Department and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco revealed the seizure story. Monaco detailed that federal authorities had “turned the tables on Darkside.”But from the very moment this story broke by a number of mainstream media outlets, there were a few discrepancies. The first was whether or not the U.S. government advised Colonial Pipeline to oblige the ransomware demands or specifically told the company to pay. If the government did tell the business to pay Darkside then it would contradict the government’s stance toward not paying ransomware hackers.The criminals used a ""Payment Server"" that was easily tracked by the FBI and their physical cloud server was just found and searched for a password.This had nothing to do with #Bitcoin itself.https://t.co/AmJsHXJRha— Documenting Bitcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) June 8, 2021Another issue with the original story is when CNN originally reported on the hack, the news outlet claimed the oil company wasn’t intending to pay the ransom. According to Bloomberg, shortly after, Colonial Pipeline did pay nearly $5 million to the ransomware gang Darkside.Besides the two contradicting elements in both CNN and Bloomberg’s stories, the articles also noted differences with the digital currency used. CNN originally reported that the payment was demanded to be paid in “bitcoin,” while Bloomberg wrote Darkside asked for “difficult-to-trace” cryptocurrencies. CNN’s article was updated after Bloomberg’s article published to reflect the same narrative.Then there’s the fact that it is impossible to crack a bitcoin (BTC) key without forcing the owner to reveal the private key. This is a constant theme on Twitter, as the crypto community discusses the situation of how the FBI agent obtained the private key. The story’s affidavit filed on June 7, 2021, explains how law enforcement leveraged “blockchain explorers” to trace the coins. But other than that the affidavit is extremely vague and contains lots of redactions.The report published yesterday on Bitcoin.com News explains that executives from Blockchain Intelligence Group (CSE: BIGG) highlight that law enforcement was dependent on “training and analysis [that] requires advanced tools and learning” Other blockchain surveillance companies also followed the ransomware coins as Elliptic recently wrote about following Darkside funds.So far between all the comments from Monaco, the Justice Department, the FBI agent’s affidavit, and comments from a few blockchain analysis teams, there are no dots that are deeply connected to how the FBI obtained ownership of the private key now in possession.A report published by NPR discloses three possible scenarios. One possibility, NPR’s Vanessa Romo notes is that maybe the federal agents were tipped off by an insider in the Darkside gang. The second theory is that Darkside was “careless” or a member of the gang slipped by releasing information tied to the key.Another theory could be that the FBI was able to shakedown a third party or possibly a cryptocurrency exchange. Some people even openly attacked bitcoin’s “key selling points” that it was supposed to be “beyond the reach of the government.”Something seems weird about this whole case. Was the BTC sent to an exchange?— Rick McCracken DIGI (@RichardMcCrackn) June 8, 2021The lawyer Jake Chervinsky who often comments on the blockchain and crypto space regularly said: “We don’t know exactly how FBI seized the Colonial Pipeline ransom [and] they’re not telling us. The warrant application suggests they got the private key. Maybe from the DarkSide server seizure? There’s no suggestion that an exchange or custodian was involved, but that’s possible.”Independent journalist Jordan Schachtel gave his opinion about the situation on Twitter and told his 123,000 followers that the “FBI did not ‘hack back’ a bitcoin wallet, despite claims that they did. It’s mathematically impossible to hack private keys.” Schachtel continued:[There is] no evidence of Russian involvement. This was all entirely avoidable if Colonial had basic security measures in place. I think it’s fair to say that it is currently impossible to hack private keys. Improbable is not strong enough language to demonstrate how unlikely it is to retain a private key through computing power. Quantum is still very much a theoretical threat.Schachtel and many others also discovered the warrant that does indicate the U.S. government obtained the key by leveraging a warrant. The journalist said that it was possibly an exchange based in San Fransico or a database server based in the state of California.Ransom hackers used a rented cloud server.FBI got a subpoena to take control of the rented serverand recover half of the total 75 #btc The FBI didn’t “crack Bitcoin.” They got the wallet encryption key (password) from the server. pic.twitter.com/WwHTRjiHod— Amy Snow (@helloamysnow) June 8, 2021The CSO at Coinbase, Philip Martin, said he saw a lot of accusations pointing at Coinbase as possibly being “involved” with the seizure. Martin and Coinbase insist that “Coinbase was not the target of the warrant and did not receive the ransom or any part of the ransom at any point. We also have no evidence that the funds went through a Coinbase account/wallet.”The election attorney, litigator, and bitcoin practice group leader, Bryan Jacoutot, reiterated the fact that bitcoin private keys cannot be “hacked.”“For those of you who think the US gov’t cracked SHA-256 and correctly guessed the private key of the Colonial Pipeline hackers,” Jacoutot said. “Here’s a fun fact: The size of bitcoin’s private key space is 10^77. For comparison, the amount of *atoms* in the observable universe is 10^80.”A Twitter account called “Cthulhu” mentioned it could be a false flag and said:So either the FBI were the hackers of the Colonial Pipeline or they don’t need a key to get anyone’s BTC. LOL. I don’t think too much thought went into doing this false flag.“The FBI either was given the private keys or they stole them,” another individual dubbed Kingt Crypto remarked on Monday. The fact is the FBI didn’t crack a bitcoin wallet. No one can crack a secure bitcoin wallet. The FBI obtained the private keys to the Darkside funds via getting an encryption key to a cloud server by obtaining a warrant issued in San Fransico.Currently, as the story continues to trend across the web, there are lots of skeptics questioning the ‘official’ tale told by the U.S. government.Do you believe the federal government’s official story about the Colonial Pipeline bitcoin ransomware case?

838,Skybridge Capital Says Bitcoin Still Has More Upside Than Gold,"Jun 8, 2021","The chief investment officer of global investment firm Skybridge Capital says bitcoin still has more upside than gold. While expecting both gold and bitcoin to rally, he said his hedge fund is sticking to bitcoin.Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer (CIO) and senior portfolio manager at Skybridge Capital, a $7.5 billion hedge fund, says gold is good but bitcoin is better, Bloomberg reported Sunday. He believes that both gold and bitcoin are likely to rally even as the Federal Reserve moves to taper asset purchases, elaborating:We’re going to stick to bitcoin and crypto because we just think there’s more upside.While acknowledging that bitcoin has more volatility than gold, the CIO noted: “you’re going to capture a little bit more juice than you will in gold from that same phenomenon.”The price of bitcoin soared to the $65,000 level in April before plunging. It currently stands at $32,512 based on data from Bitcoin.com Markets. Meanwhile, gold came close to sinking into a bear market in March but its price recovered and erases year-to-date losses.Gayeski, added:All fiat-currency alternatives — which have all gone through fairly recent substantial corrections — are in a much better place now to handle that eventual taper and gradual slowing of money-supply growth, than they were as they were making higher-highs after higher-highs.Skybridge launched its bitcoin fund in December last year with $25 million. By the time it opened up to the public in January, the fund’s assets under management had risen to $310 million. The Skybridge Bitcoin Fund is an institutional-grade fund investing in bitcoin. Fidelity Digital Assets, a division of Fidelity Investments, serves as the firm’s bitcoin custodian and Ernst & Young serves as its auditor.According to Gayeski, the Skybridge Bitcoin Fund is up 51.2% as of June 1, from its inception last December.The firm’s founder, Anthony Scaramucci, has predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $100,000 before the year-end simply due to heavy demand for the cryptocurrency and its diminishing supply.In March, the firm registered a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gayeski expects the SEC to approve the product by the fourth quarter of 2021 or the first quarter of next year.Do you agree with Skybridge Capital’s executive about bitcoin?

839,British Asset Manager Ruffer Bags $1.1 Billion Profit From Bitcoin,"Jun 8, 2021","British asset management firm Ruffer reportedly said its bitcoin investment has generated about $1.1 billion in profit. The firm says bitcoin has been “a wonderful store of value” and it is still optimistic about the cryptocurrency in the long term.London-based asset management firm Ruffer revealed that it made $1.1 billion in profit from its bitcoin investment in five months, The Sunday Times reported on June 6. The firm has about £22.4 billion ($32 billion) under management as of April 30.Hamish Baillie, an investment director at Ruffer, said the asset management firm initially invested about $600 million in bitcoin in November last year when the price of BTC was below $20,000. The director detailed:When the price doubled, we took some profits for our clients in December and early January. We actively managed the position and by the time we sold the last tranche in April, the total profit was slightly more than $1.1 billion.Baillie explained that stimulus checks have fueled some demand for cryptocurrencies, noting that younger people’s interest in them could falter as lockdowns end and economies reopen.The investment director expects institutions to keep buying BTC for their portfolios and embrace the cryptocurrency as an alternative haven asset.Regarding whether Ruffer will buy more bitcoin, the director said that it is “certainly not off the menu.” Moreover, he called out “hyperbole and misinformation” surrounding bitcoin’s energy consumption. He also pointed out bitcoin’s “huge social benefits” in countries such as Venezuela. Baillie opined:It’s been a wonderful store of value.Ruffer previously explained that its BTC investment “diversifies the company’s investments in gold and inflation-linked bonds, and acts as a hedge to some of the monetary and market risks that we see.” The firm further noted: “Due to zero interest rates the investment world is desperate for new safe-havens and uncorrelated assets. We think we are relatively early to this, at the foothills of a long trend of institutional adoption and financialisation of bitcoin.”A spokesperson for Ruffer was quoted by Reuters on Tuesday as saying:Long term, we remain interested in digital assets and the role they can play in real wealth preservation. In the short term, following the sharp increase in the bitcoin price, we felt bitcoin was exhibiting more risk.What do you think about Ruffer’s bitcoin strategy?

840,White House Tech Advisor Tim Wu Keeps at Least $1 Million in Bitcoin,"Jun 8, 2021","Tim Wu, top advisor to the Biden administration on technology and competition policy, holds more than $1 million in cryptocurrency, shows a recently filed financial disclosure. The antitrust expert, who is known as a prominent big tech critic, has in the past questioned the value of bitcoin. U.S. President Joe Biden’s tech advisor, Tim Wu, is a millionaire in bitcoin, Politico wrote in article this week, quoting his personal financial disclosure. The declaration has been provided to the publication by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, which requested the document from the White House.According to the disclosure Wu owns between $1 million and $5 million in bitcoin (BTC) as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 in filecoin (FIL), the cryptocurrency of a platform that offers decentralized crypto storage services. The official information also reveals that Wu’s bitcoin investment is the largest holding in his financial portfolio.Wu now serves as a special assistant for technology and competition policy to the president at the National Economic Council. In March, he went on leave from his position as a law professor at Columbia University to join the White House. He is considered a strong critic of the growing power large tech corporations wield.Timothy Wu is not involved in shaping the Biden administration’s cryptocurrency policy. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a White House official told Politico:Tim is recused from any particular matters involving bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally because of his financial interest, and has not worked on any such matters.The university professor hasn’t always been bullish on bitcoin. Questioning its worth, Tim Wu called it a “bubble” back in 2017.“Bitcoin isn’t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself,” Wu wrote in an article while also admitting that this “illusory quality” describes most other forms of money as well. He recognized bitcoin’s potential to “work fine” as a store of value although doubting its usability for everyday payments.Based on a BTC price of around $34,000 at the time of writing, Politico estimates Wu’s holdings at between 29 and 146 actual bitcoins. The publication notes, however, that the value of the leading cryptocurrency is now more than 40% down from its highs earlier this year. The White House advisor’s bitcoin investment accounts for 25 to 43% of his assets worth between almost $4 million and $11.5 million.The Biden administration has recently made cryptocurrency a key point in a new presidential directive on fighting corruption as Bitcoin.com News reported. A White House official emphasized that the U.S. government will focus on modernizing existing anti-corruption laws to address cryptocurrencies and cybercrime, stating that the executive power in Washington is “looking at crypto as a means of illicit finance.”What do you think of White House advisor Tim Wu’s bitcoin investment?

843,As Crypto Interest Winds Down Bitcoin's Daily Transaction Rate Plummets to Two-Year Lows,"Jun 7, 2021","Onchain data indicates that bitcoin transactions per day have plummeted to lows not seen since October 2018. Further, bitcoin transaction fees have dropped 93% after touching a high of $62 per transaction in April 2021.While bitcoin (BTC) prices have dropped to lower bound ranges, after touching an all-time high over $64K per coin, the number of daily transactions has dive-bombed as well.In fact, daily BTC transactions have been plummeting since the first week of 2021, as statistics show a high of 387K transactions on January 6. Data from bitinfocharts.com indicates that the number of bitcoin transactions confirmed on June 3 was around 249K. Between the first week of January up until now, daily transactions have slipped by more than 35%.Fork.lol stats show on June 7, the BTC network processed around 221,624 transactions on Monday. From February 14 to April 28, 2021, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network outpaced the BTC chain’s daily transaction rate during that time span.Today, the BCH chain has a lower daily transaction count than BTC, as current daily stats for June 7 show, BCH has processed around 68,973 transactions. BTC transactions per day have not been this low since October 2018, as daily transactions have been consistently higher since then.BTC’s highest daily transaction rate has only tapped 478K confirmed transactions, while BCH broke over two million confirmed transactions per day during the first week of September 2018. In addition to BTC transactions per day dropping to 2018 levels, bitcoin fees have slid as well during the last few weeks.On April 21, 2021, the average BTC transaction fee hit a high of $62.79 per transaction according to ycharts.com. The same ycharts’ data set shows fees are down to $4.38 per transaction today.The lack of interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, may have contributed to the daily transaction levels dipping to 2018 levels. The search query “bitcoin” touched an all-time high on Google Trends in May with a score of 100, but the worldwide search trend has dipped to 52 on June 5.Daily transactions for a great number of the top digital assets including BTC, ETH, DOGE, XRP, LTC, and BCH have all dipped significantly.

844,"Donald Trump Detests Bitcoin, Calls BTC a Scam, Wants Heavy Crypto Regulation","Jun 7, 2021","Former U.S. President Donald Trump says he does not like bitcoin because it is a currency that competes with the dollar, which he wants to be the currency of the world. He calls bitcoin a scam and wants cryptocurrency to be very heavily regulated.Donald Trump talked about bitcoin in an interview with Fox Business Monday. Responding to a comment that he does not like bitcoin and he would not invest in it, Trump said the cryptocurrency “seems like a scam.” He noted that when he was president, the price of bitcoin was only $6,000, much lower than it is now, adding:I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar, essentially it’s a currency competing against a dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That’s what I have always said.The former U.S. president also talked about bitcoin in response to questions regarding recent cyberattacks on major companies.Emphasizing several times during the interview that “the currency should be the dollar,” he explained that “when you have things like that out there, you know what happens is, you really lose something.” He added:It takes the edge off of the dollar and the importance of the dollar.Trump reiterated, “My opinion is that the currency of this world should be the dollar, and I don’t think we should have all of the bitcoins of the world out there,” elaborating: “I think they should regulate them very, very high.”Trump has never been a fan of bitcoin. In July 2019, when he was still the president of the United States, he commented about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general in a series of tweets:I am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.The former president also targeted Libra, the crypto project proposed by social media giant Facebook. Libra is now called Diem. Trump’s tweet says: “Facebook Libra’s ‘virtual currency’ will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations, just like other banks, both national and international.”Trump concluded his series of tweets with: “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States dollar.”What do you think about Trump’s comments on bitcoin and the U.S. dollar? Let us know in the comments section below.

845,"Asset Managers Could Violate Fiduciary Duty If They Don't Consider Bitcoin, Says Finance Professor","Jun 7, 2021","A professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California says that asset managers focusing on growth strategy could violate their fiduciary duty if they do not consider bitcoin in their portfolios.Financial researcher Nik Bhatia said last week that asset managers seeking growth returns on behalf of their clients need to consider bitcoin, the Insider reported.Bhatia is also an adjunct professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business. In addition, he is the author of the book “Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies.”He explained:Growth managers that are responsible for securing growth returns for their clients that haven’t done research into bitcoin at this point are bordering on some sort of fiduciary violation.“If you’re ignoring bitcoin now as a growth manager, you are ignoring that an alternative monetary reality has come into existence on this planet,” the professor said, clarifying that he is not referring to fixed-income managers whose mandates are capital preservation and income.Bhatia believes that asset managers should at least do their own analysis of whether bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are right for their clients. After studying the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies, they can decide whether to invest. However, he said that is not what he has been seeing, emphasizing that asset managers seem to cite old narratives, advocating avoidance of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He further noted that those who make excuses that bitcoin is a bubble have not done their research.Turning attention to the U.S. dollar, Bhatia said the USD is losing its status as the global reserve currency, noting that with inflation kicking in, assets like land are being considered almost superior reserve assets to the dollar.The researcher further said bitcoin is here to stay, not only as a store of value, but it may become “the anchor for the global monetary system in the future, replacing the US dollar,” the publication conveyed. He also believes that “bitcoin’s protocol for monetary settlement will become the system on which other systems are built.”“I worked in the bond industry for several years, and I worked in both operations and trading capacities. I was involved in emailing and faxing dollars through the wire process, and Fed wire, and repo settlement, and US Treasury securities settlements through DTC,” Bhatia shared with the publication, elaborating:I saw it every day of my life for several years up, close, and personal. I know the archaic nature of final settlement and the dollar world, it’s just old technology. And bitcoin is the technology that will underpin what we think of as final settlement in the future.Do you agree with Bhatia? Let us know in the comments section below.

847,While China's Bitcoin Miners Flock to Central Asia Canaan Sets up ASIC Mining Rig Service in Kazakhstan,"Jun 7, 2021","On Monday, the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer Canaan Inc. announced the company has established an overseas after-sales center in Kazakhstan. According to Canaan, the service center will provide local customers with after-sales services like machine testing, warranty services, maintenance, and technical consultation.Ever since China started cracking down on bitcoin miners in the region, Kazakhstan has been a target for relocation. A number of Chinese operations have focused on the Central Asian country and former Soviet republic for relocation after the clampdown.According to a recent report from Wired, quoting an anonymous source “familiar with China’s bitcoin mining industry,” Chinese miners who have “panicked” are moving to Kazakhstan “overnight.”Following a number of firms announcing migration to Kazakhstan after the Chinese government’s statements, the publicly listed firm Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) explained it has established an overseas after-sales service center for miners in the country that borders China and Russia.“Through the service center, local customers will be able to access technical support, guidance, and training services for basic mining machine operations such as firmware upgrades, Fleet Management System (“FMS”) applications for mine management,” Canaan detailed.“As well as mining pool access and configuration. To gauge computing power and machine stability, local customers will be able to test the performance of their mining machines at the service center. Customers requiring technical support for firmware upgrades, including optimisation of temperature, fan control, and start-up speeds, as well as the reduction of frequency, voltage, and bug fixes, will now be able to do so at the center,” the firm added.A few years ago, Kazakhstan officials seemed hesitant about allowing the crypto economy to flourish in the country near the Caspian Sea. In 2018, reports noted that Kazakhstan would possibly prohibit bitcoin mining and other types of crypto services. A few years out, the country’s authorities and financial regulators seem a lot more open to adopting crypto assets. Recently Kazakhstan’s central bank announced plans to pilot a central bank digital currency (CBDC) with a few private companies.The founder of the Kazakhstan-based Xive, a cryptocurrency energy contract operation, says that Chinese mining companies are regularly seeking out plots in the country to set up shop.“These people are waiting for some clarification from the Chinese government, and they are looking for a plan B in case the government restricts or somehow bans mining altogether,” Bekbauov said in an interview.Canaan’s after-sales team plans to respond to miners located in Kazakhstan working in the field in order to repair mining rigs, and to “minimise the potential revenue impact on customers.” Mining farm operators leveraging Canaan-brand machines will be able to monitor batches of rigs and Canaan’s after-sales team plans to train miners on how to use FMS tools.“The establishment of the service center in Kazakhstan is strategic in expanding our after-sales geographical coverage and providing faster and easier access to support our growing international customer base,” Canaan’s chairman and CEO Nangeng Zhang said about the company’s new venture. “This development builds on our commitment to service excellence and providing a best-in-class client experience,” the Canaan executive concluded.What do you think about Canaan setting up an ASIC mining rig service center in Kazakhstan?

851,"Out of Thousands of MIT Students That Got Free Bitcoin in 2014 - 6 Year Holders Saw 13,000% Gains","Jun 7, 2021","Over six years ago, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a couple of scholars distributed $100 in bitcoin to 3,100 students. According to testimony from a few participants who held the leading crypto asset since then, the students netted 13,000% in profit.For a very long time now, MIT has been experimenting and supporting bitcoin (BTC), the leading crypto asset in terms of market capitalization. In 2014, two computer science students Dan Elitzer and Jeremy Rubin distributed $100 worth of BTC to thousands of MIT undergraduates. After Rubin and Elitzer left MIT, they continued working in the cryptocurrency space. On Friday, a few of the students who held the BTC for over six years explained that they saw significant gains.One particular student, Mary Spanjers, told Bloomberg that she still has the BTC and has kept it tucked away. Spanjers said that the $100 worth of BTC before the May market rout could have fetched her around $20,000 or around 13,000% in profit. At first, Spanjers said many students thought it was just a joke. “It’s truly remarkable,” Spanjers detailed during her interview. “Most of us thought it was a bit of a joke.”The MBA student that started the free bitcoin initiative, Elitzer also founded the school’s Bitcoin Club but he and Rubin do not know how many people kept or sold the BTC. However, if every MIT student kept the digital asset, they would have netted around $60 million total. One student who works for a crypto firm called Ontology, Erick Pinos, ended up selling his free bitcoin. Today, however, Pinos said he keeps all of his funds in the crypto economy and further stressed:I’m all about cryptocurrencies.A former MIT student who created an application called Fireflies, Sam Udotong, eventually sold the digital asset. “If I had held on to that bitcoin, it would have been more like $300 to $400 per delivery,” Udotong remarked. Former MIT student Marilynn Bach ended up keeping her crypto and said “Sometimes if my friends or co-workers talk about cryptocurrency, I’ll be, like, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s the thing I have.’”A robotics engineer at Pendar Technologies, Selam Gano, said she sold her BTC for $300 worth of food when it increased 3x in value. “It was free money, I don’t have any regrets,” Gano said during her interview. “I got an MIT degree, which is the most important thing to me,” Gano added.Two years later, an article published in the Boston Globe noted that after the bitcoin experiment, only “14%” were still “actively using it.” When the MIT Bitcoin Club started and distributed the bitcoin a few years later the MIT COOP, a store for the public, students and faculty stopped accepting BTC for purchases. The Liberty Teller brand bitcoin ATM located inside the COOP was also removed from the building a few years later.What do you think about the MIT students who kept their bitcoin and those who sold the asset not too long after they got the free coin? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

852,Bitcoin FOMO and Paul Tudor Jones Led Stan Druckenmiller to Invest Millions in BTC,"Jun 6, 2021","Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has shared how he got into bitcoin and it involved famed hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. When bitcoin was going up, Druckenmiller said, “I just couldn’t stand the fact that it was going up and I didn’t own it … I felt like a moron.”Renowned investor Stan Druckenmiller has shared how he got into bitcoin in an interview with The Hustle published on May 26. He also shared his views on ethereum and dogecoin, as Bitcoin News previously reported.Druckenmiller founded Duquesne Capital in 1981. He managed money for George Soros as the lead portfolio manager for the Quantum Fund until 2000. He and Soros made massive profits betting against the British pound in 1992.When the price of bitcoin skyrocketed from $50 to $17,000, Druckenmiller described, “I just sat there aghast,” admitting, “I wanted to buy it every day.” The billionaire investor elaborated:It was going up and — even though I didn’t think much of it — I just couldn’t stand the fact that it was going up and I didn’t own it. I never owned it from like $50 to $17,000, I felt like a moron.When the price of BTC plummeted to the $3,000 level, two things happened that pushed Druckenmiller into investing in the cryptocurrency.The first was him realizing the problem that bitcoin fixes. He said early on that “crypto was a solution in search of a problem,” not knowing what the problem was at the time. Then, “I found the problem,” he exclaimed, adding that it was “When we did the CARES act and Chairman Powell started crossing all sorts of red lines in terms of what the Fed would do and wouldn’t do.” Druckenmiller elaborated:The problem was Jay Powell and the world’s central bankers going nuts and making fiat money even more questionable than it already has been when I used to own gold.The second thing that convinced him to buy bitcoin was after he got a call from billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. “I got a call from Paul Jones,” he recalled. Jones told him: “Do you know that when bitcoin went from $17,000 to $3,000 that 86% of the people that owned it at $17,000, never sold it?”Druckenmiller admitted: “This was huge in my mind. So here’s something with a finite supply and 86% of the owners are religious zealots. I mean, who the hell holds something through $17,000 to $3000? And it turns out none of the — the 86% — sold it. Add that to this new central bank craziness phenomenon.”While he was still mulling over whether to buy bitcoin, the price shot up to $6,000. Druckenmiller then started buying:I got to buying some just because these kids on the West Coast are already worth more than I am, and they’re going to be making a lot more money than me in the future. For some reason, they’re looking at this thing the way I’ve always looked at gold, which is a store of value if I don’t trust fiat currencies.The billionaire investor further described the obstacle he faced when trying to buy BTC. “It’s funny. I tried to buy $100 million of bitcoin at a price of $6,200. It took me 2 weeks to buy $20 million. I bought it all around $6,500, I think,” he recalled.He thought that was “ridiculous,” considering it would have taken him two seconds to buy that much gold. Druckenmiller then confessed:So like an idiot, I stopped buying it. The next thing I knew, it is trading at $36,000.Druckenmiller further shared: “I took my costs and then some out of it and I still own some of it.” He admitted: “My heart’s never been in it,” emphasizing that he is “a 68-year old dinosaur.” Nonetheless, he realized that “once it started moving and these institutions started upping it, I could see the old elephant trying to get through the keyhole and they can’t fit through in time.”In November last year, Druckenmiller said that bitcoin could be an attractive store of value that could beat gold. He also thinks that the U.S. dollar will likely lose its reserve currency status in 15 years. Jones also said last year that he saw massive upside to bitcoin, like investing in early Apple or Google. He further said, “I came to the conclusion that bitcoin was going to be the best of inflation trades, the defensive trades that you would take.”What do you think about how Stan Druckenmiller got into bitcoin?

853,Norway Finance Minister Sees Great Interest in Cryptocurrency — Says Bitcoin Could See 'Breakthroughs',"Jun 6, 2021","The finance minister of Norway believes that bitcoin may experience “breakthroughs.” He noted that “There is no doubt that there is great interest in cryptocurrency both in Norway and internationally.”The finance minister of Norway, Jan Tore Sanner, suggested in an interview last week that “cryptocurrencies will at some point move past the volatility for which they’re currently known and experience a period of ‘breakthroughs,'” Bloomberg reported. He was quoted as saying:It is clear that there may be a development over time, whereby you will be able to get more stabilization mechanisms in the currencies that can lead to greater breakthroughs and upheavals in the slightly longer term.However, he noted that for the time being, cryptocurrency is not a market he would recommend consumers to enter.The finance minister added that he does not believe crypto assets will go mainstream until they are properly regulated, mentioning that cryptocurrencies are also “popular with criminals.”Nonetheless, Sanner said people should be free to make their own decision whether to invest in bitcoin but emphasized that the cryptocurrency is not yet ready to be used as a substitute for money. He opined:There is no doubt that there is great interest in cryptocurrency both in Norway and internationally. But so far it has been unsuitable as a means of payment.Bitcoin News recently reported that a few Norwegian billionaires have gotten into the crypto space. They include Ole Andreas Halvorsen, Øystein Stray Spetalen, and Kjell Inge Røkke.What do you think about the comments by Norway’s finance minister? Let us know in the comments section below.

854,Goldman Sachs Survey: Chief Investment Officers Say Bitcoin Is Their Least Favorite Investment,"Jun 6, 2021","Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently held two roundtable sessions for chief investment officers of hedge funds. The bank found that they see bitcoin as their least favorite investment. In contrast, the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey found that “long bitcoin” was the most crowded trade.Goldman Sachs published a note Saturday after conducting a survey to find out what investments chief investment officers (CIOs) favor in the current market. Goldman Sachs strategist Timothy Moe wrote:We held two CIO roundtable sessions earlier this week, which were attended by 25 CIOs from various long-only and hedge funds. Their most favorite is growth style but least favorite on bitcoin.Besides growth style, the CIOs favored value style and then commodities. Their least favorite investment was bitcoin, followed by new IPOs, and rate-sensitive investments.Unlike Goldman Sachs, Bank of America (BofA) found that bitcoin was a popular trade among asset managers it surveyed. The bank’s Fund Manager Survey for May, in which 216 fund managers with $625 billion in total assets under management (AUM) participated, showed that “long bitcoin” was the most crowded trade in the world. In the previous month, long bitcoin was the second-most crowded trade.Unlike the surveyed CIOs, Goldman Sachs’ analysts are quite bullish on the outlook of bitcoin. They recently said that fear of missing out (FOMO) is driving institutional investors to the cryptocurrency. Moreover, the bank recently declared bitcoin an investable asset and a new asset class.Goldman Sachs has also established a cryptocurrency trading desk with the aim to offer a full spectrum of crypto investments. The firm said that institutional demand for BTC continues to grow significantly.What do you think about CIOs saying that bitcoin is their least favorite investment?

856,Square Takes a Swipe at the Bitcoin Energy Debate With $5 Million Solar Mining Investment,"Jun 6, 2021","As the conversation about Bitcoin’s energy consumption reaches a fever pitch, Jack Dorsey’s payment provider Square has unveiled plans to fund a sustainable bitcoin mining facility in conjunction with Blockstream.Bitcoin faces no shortage of consternation, but the spat over the cryptocurrency’s footprint spilled out into the public over the last few weeks following comments from Elon Musk.Although U.S. miners have come together to form the Bitcoin Mining Council following Musk’s critique by promising more transparency on mining’s energy use, Jack Dorsey’s Square plans to lead the way in terms of substantive action. Instead of jawboning the crypto up and down, Dorsey is putting Square’s reputation on the line with an investment allocation to a sustainable mining initiative.The payment giant revealed plans to invest $5 million in a solar-energy-based mining facility in partnership with Blockstream, which will be responsible for providing the infrastructure development know-how. The project will ultimately deliver a proof of concept that underlines how sustainable bitcoin mining can be accomplished at scale, paving the way for more widespread adoption of these techniques.Besides committing itself towards pushing renewable energy into the bitcoin mining conversation, Square envisions the project demonstrating how the cryptocurrency can be an accelerator for heightened sustainability in the future.This action alone contrasts sharply with the more opaque position taken by Musk. However, speculation has also grown that the entrepreneur wants to throw his hat into the ring by introducing a green mining solution of his own by leveraging his existing hardware manufacturing know-how.Square has long been a supporter of cryptocurrencies, and this latest interest in mining echoes other ambitions at the payment provider, like introducing its own hardware wallet solution. During recent tweets, Dorsey underscored that the company was considering collaborating with the community to build a bitcoin hardware wallet to focus on core features like non-custodial functionality, a user-friendly experience, reliability, and minimal setup time.Do you think Dorsey’s investment in solar-powered bitcoin mining would have come about without Elon Musks’s awakening the green sleeping giant?

857,Tony Hawk Purchased Bitcoin in 2012 After Reading About the Silk Road Marketplace,"Jun 6, 2021","Tony Hawk, the American professional skateboarder often referred to as ‘Birdman,’ discussed bitcoin at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami and told the crowd he got into the crypto economy in 2012. Hawk said he heard about the crypto asset after reading about the Silk Road marketplace and at the time, he said to himself bitcoin is the “future of finance.”The popular skateboarder Tony Hawk spent some time with bitcoiners this past weekend at the multi-day Bitcoin 2021 conference held in Miami. During Hawk’s speech at the event, he explained how he was “living the dream” when he was skating for a living. He compared this passion to people involved with bitcoin and said:I embraced the idea that skateboarding was for misfits. I felt like a misfit as a kid. I felt like I found my community, my tribe.At the conference, Hawk discussed the cryptocurrency revolution with the cofounder of Augur Jeremy Gardner. The skateboarder further revealed he is also auctioning 50 limited edition bitcoin skateboards as well for charity. There’s also a single limited edition Hawk-signed skateboard that says “End Fiat.”While speaking to the crowd in Miami, Hawk noted that he discovered bitcoin during the time when the Silk Road marketplace existed back in 2012. The skateboarder said he was reading about the Silk Road situation and was fascinated by the technology.“I was reading about the chaos of [the] Silk Road when that was all happening and I was fascinated with the payment component they had and it was obviously bitcoin,” Hawk said during his talk. “There was an anonymous side to it but it was also just the idea that it was very fast and international and to me, it was the future of finances so I immediately researched how to buy bitcoin. I wasn’t on [the] Silk Road,” he added. “But I did buy bitcoin in 2012.” The popular skateboarder continued:I held, pretty much. I didn’t do much with it. I was watching it obviously. I was holding on to my Bitcoin and charity water was the first charity that I knew of that accepted bitcoin as a donation so in my infinite wisdom I gave him four back in 2012.When Hawk donated the funds to charity water it was back in 2014, and the organization’s CEO Scott Harrison detailed it was sold to fund the charity for far less than what BTC is worth today.Hawk also did a meet-and-greet session with a number of conference attendees who held a special pass. Some of the proceeds from the meet-and-greet special passes will be donated to The Skatepark Project nonprofit, which helps build local skateparks worldwide.What do you think about Tony Hawk getting into bitcoin back in 2012?

858,"Anonymous Targets Elon Musk for Destroying Crypto Holders' Lives, Trying to Control Bitcoin","Jun 5, 2021","The decentralized group Anonymous has published a message for Elon Musk in a video where they called the Tesla CEO “nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention.” They shed light on many things people may not know about Musk, including how he treats his employees, harms the environment, where his fortune came from, how Tesla actually makes money, and his attempt to centralize and control bitcoin mining.Anonymous, a decentralized international activist and hacktivism movement, posted a video Friday directed at Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It is unknown if the people behind this video are the same Anonymous as the hacktivist group known for cyber attacks against several governments since 2003. The video begins with a message: “Greetings citizens of the world. This is a message from Anonymous for Elon musk.”The video starts by explaining why Elon Musk became popular. “For the past several years you have enjoyed one of the most favorable reputations of anyone in the billionaire class because you have tapped into the desire that many of us have to live in a world with electric cars and space exploration,” the group described, adding:But recently your carefully created public image is being exposed, and people are beginning to see you as nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention.“It appears that your quest to save the world is more rooted in a superiority and savior complex than it is an actual concern for humanity,” they declared.Anonymous then emphasized that Elon Musk’s lack of concern for humanity “has been obvious to [his] employees for a long time who have faced intolerable conditions under [his] command for years.”The group referenced an article in the Observer titled “Elon Musk, Tesla are pushing factory workers to the brink as profits soar.” The article explains that “Tesla workers and worker advocates say the company is risking the health and safety of its workers in relentless pursuit of these gaudy numbers.”In addition, Anonymous referenced a different article on The Times titled “‘Blood batteries’ fuel the fortune of Elon Musk,” stating:It is also obvious to the young children working in your overseas lithium mines, which are destroying the local environment as well.“You have been open about your willingness to stage coups in order to install dictators in places where your toxic products are being mined,” the group also said.“You have even prematurely crowned yourself ‘Emperor of Mars,’ a place where you will be sending people to die,” the group continued, pointing to an article titled “Elon Musk proclaims himself emperor of Mars.”“Your fanboys overlook these issues because they are focused on the potential good that your projects can bring to the world,” Anonymous suggested.However, the group added: “you are not the only show in town, and your competition is growing more intense with each passing day. There are plenty of other companies working on space exploration and electric vehicles. You are just the only CEO who has gained a cult following through shitposting and trolling the world on social media.”Anonymous then talked about how Tesla makes its money. “Many people are now learning that the vast majority of Tesla‘s income doesn’t actually come from selling cars. It comes from government subsidies, selling carbon tax credit for your innovation with clean energy,” the group detailed. However, they pointed out:This technically isn’t your innovation though because you aren’t actually the founder of Tesla. You simply purchased the company from two people much more intelligent than you are.The two people Anonymous referred to were Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In an interview with CNBC, Tarpenning said Musk was an investor of the company. “He was always supportive from the beginning but he wasn’t the founder. We started it,” he confirmed. Eberhard added: “He actually accomplished some amazing things … I’m not sure why he has to also said that he was the founder when he wasn’t. I don’t understand that.”Referencing an article titled “Tesla: Bitcoin sales and environmental credits boost profits,” Anonymous suspected:Tesla has also made more money holding bitcoin for two months than they did in years of selling cars. It is also more than likely that this bitcoin was purchased with money from these government subsidies.On the subject of bitcoin and Tesla’s income from the government, Anonymous said: “It is now widely believed that you have been forced to renounce your company’s involvement with bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla’s coffers.”The group noted that “The energy use argument about proof-of-work mining is a very nuanced conversation that requires a fairly complex understanding of how power grids work and how excess energy is wasted by power companies and sought out by crypto miners,” emphasizing:This is a conversation that you have been having for over a year and were intimately aware of. But as soon as your main source of income was threatened, you pretended to be clueless in an attempt to play both sides of the fence.The video then talked about Elon Musk’s attempt to centralize and control bitcoin mining. On May 24, the Tesla CEO announced on Twitter that he had met with leading North American bitcoin miners. During the closed-door meeting hosted by Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor, he said the miners have agreed to form a Bitcoin Mining Council.However, Anonymous said:[Elon’s] move to create a Bitcoin Mining Council was rightly seen as an attempt to centralize the industry and take it under your control.The group then referenced an article on Bitcoin News titled “Crypto proponents become skeptical of closed-door meeting between billionaires and bitcoin miners.”Anonymous also accuses Elon Musk of destroying crypto holders’ lives with his memes and tweets, stating in their video:Reading from the comments on your Twitter posts, it seems that the games you have played with the crypto markets have destroyed lives. Millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives.“This is something that you will never understand because you were born into the stolen wealth of a South African apartheid emerald mine and have no clue what struggle is like for most of the working people in the world,” the group further opined, referencing an article titled “Elon Musk’s family once owned an emerald mine in Zambia — here’s the fascinating story of how they came to own it.”While acknowledging, “Of course, they took the risk upon themselves when they invested and everyone knows to be prepared for volatility in crypto,” Anonymous maintained, “but your tweets this week show a clear disregard for the average working person.” They concluded:As hard-working people have their dreams liquidated over your public temper tantrums, you continue to mock them with memes from one of your million-dollar mansions.The video ends with a message to Musk that says: “You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you’ve met your match. We are anonymous. We are Legion. Expect us.” The video is shown below:What do you think about Anonymous’ video and message to Elon Musk? Let us know in the comments section below.

861,Floyd Mayweather Gets Booed at Bitcoin Event for Saying 'Another Crypto Will Be Just as Big as BTC',"Jun 5, 2021","The undefeated professional boxer Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather recently spoke at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami and was booed while speaking on stage. Mayweather’s speech wasn’t appreciated by members of the crowd because he didn’t discuss bitcoin much and toward the end, Mayweather said he believes another crypto will be “just as large as bitcoin someday.”Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather has been a fan of digital currencies for a long time now, as the boxer has participated in an initial coin offering (ICO) and recently released non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles. Mayweather is preparing to have a boxing match with the Youtuber Logan Paul, and recently spoke at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami.During Mayweather’s talk on stage, he discussed how blockchain technology and things like NFTs are changing the game. The legendary boxer did not talk about bitcoin (BTC) much, even though the event organizers had tried to keep the conference “bitcoin only.”In fact, the conference agenda notes that attendees should take alternative cryptocurrency discussions outside the event. However, the first day of the Bitcoin 2021 conference shows it was impossible to stop discussions concerning decentralized finance (defi) and topics like NFTs.Mayweather was also wearing an “Ethereummax” t-shirt while speaking, which is the ERC20 token team that is sponsoring Mayweather’s bout with Logan Paul. Toward the end of the discussion, Mayweather told the crowd that he believes at some point in time another digital asset will be just as big as bitcoin.While Mayweather said his statement, a portion of the crowd booed the undefeated boxer because they didn’t like what he had to say.“Everybody in the crypto world is competing with one another, whereas I feel like everybody should be able to choose what they want to choose and go with who they want to go with,” Mayweather said, emphasizing that people should work together. “I believe there’s gonna be another cryptocurrency just as large as bitcoin someday,” he added.As soon as he made this statement, boos from the bitcoin maximalist crowd started. However, Mayweather responded fast and said he had a right to his own opinion and others have that right as well.“Without crypto…,” Mayweather concluded. “Without no cryptocurrency, I was able to make a billion dollars. With or without any cryptocurrency, Floyd Mayweather’s going to be okay,” the famous boxer told the crowd.What do you think about Floyd Mayweather’s appearance at the Bitcoin 2021 conference and how he got booed while on stage?

862,Localbitcoins Adds Bitcoin Cash and Other Cryptocurrencies as Payment Methods,"Jun 4, 2021","Localbitcoins, one of the biggest P2P exchanges in the world, has added Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies as payment methods to acquire Bitcoin on its platform. This marks a clear departure from the earlier position of the company, which hadn’t added new payment methods and had remained Bitcoin-only for some time.Localbitcoins, one of the biggest P2P cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is now allowing its users to purchase Bitcoin with other cryptos, in a departure from its earlier Bitcoin-only approach. The company announced in a blog post last week they will now allow listings leveraging Tether (USDT), Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), USD Coin (USDC), Chainlink (LINK), and Dogecoin (DOGE) as payment methods.The exchange also added several new fiat-based payment methods that can be used internationally, and others that can only be used in specific countries. The decision marks a clear departure from the traditional Bitcoin-only stance the company has had since its creation, and effectively creates the possibility for arbitrage with altcoin prices on the platform, albeit not as directly as in a traditional exchange.Localbitcoins is one of the first P2P exchanges and, apart from the strengthening of the KYC measures associated with the use of the platform, it has not changed much. Even the user experience and webpage have remained much the same since it began operation in 2012, and the platform still lacks a mobile app.One of the reasons for this sudden change of heart could be the loss of relevance the exchange is facing in emerging markets like Venezuela, where the exchange has been moved from being the preferred way of buying bitcoin to just another good option in the market.Evidence of this is dwindling volumes of sales, which can be seen in Coin Dance statistics. This was also exacerbated by the arrival of a new P2P alternative market: Binance P2P, which is backed by the exchange, and has attracted many of Localbitcoins’ merchants and customers in the last two years. Further, other less privacy-invasive options have emerged, such as Bitcoin.com Local, where no KYC is required for direct P2P trade.Localbitcoins’ waning popularity might be just a sign of the times, as now there are tons of other ways to purchase bitcoin aside from direct, P2P exchange. However, P2P still has some key traits that make it the to-go method of acquiring cryptocurrencies for many, and Localbitcoins might be expanding its offer and payment methods to keep up with the requirements of its users.What do you think of Localbitcoins adopting new cryptocurrencies as payment methods?

863,"Payments Firm Square May Build a Hardware Wallet, Dorsey Heckled at Bitcoin Conference Over Censorship","Jun 4, 2021","The cofounder of Twitter and the CEO of the payments firm Square, Jack Dorsey, has revealed his firm is contemplating creating a bitcoin hardware wallet in collaboration with the community. Dorsey revealed this in a tweetstorm and said he wanted to share some “guiding principles” concerning this possible venture. On Friday, Jack Dorsey tweeted about the possibility of Square creating a bitcoin hardware wallet and discussed a number of principles the firm is guided by when approaching the subject. The founder of Twitter and Square explained that what the company creates needs to be “open,” as he noted that “bitcoin is for everyone.”“Square is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community,” Dorsey tweeted. “We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles. Bitcoin is for everyone. It’s important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market,” the Square CEO added.Dorsey then gave those who have already pioneered the noncustodial wallet space props, and asked his Twitter followers what the “biggest blockers to get a non-custodial solution to the next 100M people?” Numerous people answered Dorsey’s questions and a few responses discussed hardware wallets with no iOS support.“iOS support. Trezor, up until now, still doesn’t support iOS for (good reason.) If you solve this solvable problem, you gain a huge portion of the market,” one individual responded to Dorsey’s Twitter thread.“Custody doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing,” Dorsey continued. “We can probably simplify custody through ‘assisted self-custody.’ Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions?,” the Square CEO asked. He further added:Most people access the internet on mobile. Any solution we build must provide an excellent experience when using mobile, despite its shortcomings and liabilities. An uncompromising focus on mobile interaction is likely to include the most people. What are the dangers here?After Dorsey published his thread with about 12 different points, he said that Square and his team plan to “continue the conversation.” He further noted that a dedicated Twitter account would be on the way and a Github repository, as well, if the firm decides to build a hardware wallet.“We’ll update this thread with that information when we’re ready. Thanks,” Dorsey concluded.Dorsey’s hardware wallet tweet has accrued tens of thousands of likes and retweets since he announced Square’s possible hardware wallet venture. The Twitter CEO also mentioned that layer 2 capabilities and Cash App integrations with the hardware wallet are also important guiding principles.Meanwhile, after the hardware wallet announcement, Dorsey attended the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami this weekend and was heckled by a conference attendee over “censorship” and “interfering in elections.”“Why is Jack Dorsey on a stage at a Bitcoin event in the first place?” an individual tweeted in response to the heckling video.What do you think about Square thinking about creating a bitcoin hardware wallet?

864,Alternative Mining Algorithms Reap Higher Profits Than Bitcoin Mining in 2021,"Jun 4, 2021","Cryptocurrencies have jumped quite a bit in value over the course of the year and miners who verify transactions and earn digital assets have seen significant profits. While bitcoin miners have been seeing daily profits rise, a great number of other mineable digital currencies are pulling in much larger yields. The overall valuation of all cryptocurrencies in existence is around $1.5 trillion as digital asset values have risen considerably in 2021. While a great number of blockchains leverage consensus algorithms like proof-of-stake (PoS), there’s plenty of coins that can be mined with a machine like an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining rig.Mining rigs that can mine bitcoin (BTC) using the SHA256 algorithm can bring in anywhere between $7 to $16 per day in profits. That’s of course if the miner is using the latest hardware with at least 50 terahash per second (TH/s) of hashpower.Both Microbt and Bitmain produce the top BTC mining rigs on the market today because they pull in the most profits. Using today’s BTC mining difficulty and electricity costs — around $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) — the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro and the Microbt Whatsminer M30S++ get around $16 per day in profits.While that’s good, some mining rigs that mine other types of crypto assets make considerably larger profits in comparison. One such example is decred (DCR), as a mining rig that processes the Blake256R14 algorithm can make between $40 to $50 per day.The top two decred mining devices include the Strongu STU-U1++ and the Microbt Whatsminer D1. Microbt’s machine pulls 2,200 watts off the wall and produces around 48 TH/s in hashpower. Statistics indicate that the Strongu device also pulls 2,200 watts but produces about 52 TH/s.Coins that can be mined with the consensus algorithm Ethash (ubiq, ethereum, ethereum classic, pirl, and callisto) show their mining rigs rake in significant profits as well. For instance, the Innosilicon A10 Pro+ ETH miner gets around 759 megahash per second (MH/s) and $50 a day in profit.Following yields from Ethash, the consensus algorithm Equihash that mines coins like zcash, zencash, komodo and more, also sees profitable returns. The top mining rig that can dedicate hashrate to Equihash consensus is Bitmain’s Antminer Z15.The Antminer Z15 gets around $47 per day with its maximum hashrate of 420 ksol/s (solutions per second) and power consumption of around 1,510 watts. The second-best unit is a step down from Bitmain’s powerful Equihash miner — Innosilicon’s A9++ Zmaster. It does around 140 ksol/s and only pulls in $11 per day.Still, the Zmaster does better than a majority of SHA256 miners that mine BTC. Even litecoin (LTC) miners will produce better profits by mining Scrypt. At the time of publication, the Innosilicon A6+ Ltcmaster and the lower-end A6 are the top two litecoin miners.The lower-end unit gets around $16 per day, while the A6+ gets $31 per day in profit. Owners of Scrypt mining rigs don’t have to mine LTC either, as they can also mine dogecoin (DOGE), gamecredits (GAME), and verge (XVG).Behind all the profits stemming from mining rigs that produce coins from algorithms like Blake256R14, Ethash, Equihash, and Scrypt is SHA256. The SHA256 algorithm can mine bitcoin (BTC) but also coins like bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoinsv (BSV).Even though profits are lower for SHA256 devices, the number of SHA256 machines towers over the quantity of devices that mine alternative consensus algorithms. There are far more products and manufacturers that produce bitcoin miners, and the number of SHA256 machines surely eclipses all of the aforementioned mining rigs that leverage different mining rulesets combined.What do you think about the top mineable coins and the most profitable mining rigs in 2021? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

866,Bitcoin Dips as Elon Musk Tweets Broken Heart Emoji,"Jun 4, 2021","The price of the leading cryptocurrency took a hit after billionaire Elon Musk mentioned Bitcoin in a new tweet hinting at a breakup. Musk’s latest crypto post, featuring a broken heart emoji and a reference to a Linkin Park song, effectively halted this week’s market rebound. Famous entrepreneur Elon Musk has added another tweet to a string of social media posts that have deeply affected cryptocurrency markets over the past few weeks. Reasserting his role as a market influencer, this time Musk trolled Bitcoin with a hint at a possible split with the leading crypto that he has been targeting lately.In another enigmatic tweet, Musk wrote “#Bitcoin” adding a broken heart emoji and a meme of what looks like a couple discussing their breakup. The text accompanying the picture is a reference to the lyrics of “In the End,” a popular song by American rock band Linkin Park. Musk later posted a comic strip depicting a different separated couple.Following the tweet, the price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped by over 3% early on Friday to well under $38,000. After further losses, the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap was trading below $37,000 per coin at the time of writing. The drop put an end to the recent stabilization which saw the BTC price heading towards the 40k mark this week.Elon Musk’s business decisions and social media comments have boosted crypto markets in the past as was the case with Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin in February as well as his shilling of dogecoin. However, the billionaire’s attitude towards the leading cryptocurrency has been changing over time.In early May, he tweeted that his electric car company was suspending BTC payments for its vehicles, citing environmental concerns due to “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining.” The crypto-economy lost billions of dollars following the announcement.The move sparked negative reactions from the crypto community and Musk’s heated discussions with its members on social media led to speculation that Tesla may have sold its bitcoins or might be planning to do so. Its founder and chief executive later clarified that the EV manufacturer “has not sold any bitcoin.”Following the clash, Musk embarked on promoting renewable energy usage in the mining industry and Tesla stated intentions to use bitcoin as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.Musk’s comments and actions have reverberated beyond the crypto space. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez was recently quoted by CNBC as saying that the tech tycoon has highlighted an issue with bitcoin that reduces its utility as a financial asset. Suarez, who describes himself as a “big fan of Elon Musk,” suggested that one person being able to move bitcoin’s price by 20% with a single tweet is a problem showing that the crypto needs larger transactional volume and more stability to be used as a hedge against fiat currency.What do you think about Musk’s latest tweet regarding Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

867,Ron Paul Wants Bitcoin Totally Legalized to Compete With Dollar and Let the People Decide,"Jun 3, 2021","Former U.S. congressman Ron Paul says that he wants to legalize the dollar’s competition, including bitcoin, and let the people decide which money to use, not the government. “Freedom of choice will sort it out,” he said.Former presidential candidate Ron Paul discussed bitcoin as an alternative asset in an interview with Kitco News’ Michelle Makori Wednesday. Paul is an American author, physician, and retired politician. The former congressman from Texas launched The Ron Paul Liberty Report in 2015 to bring “provocative opinion and analysis to the breaking issues affecting our lives and finances,” its website details.When asked about his views on bitcoin, Paul said that he knows a lot more about precious metals being money than cryptocurrency. “I was fascinated with it for a long long time. But I’m also fascinated with what’s coming,” he opined.The former congressman added that “people ought to have as much freedom as possible to have choices.” He then describes a bill he introduced in Congress to “not only audit the Fed but also to get rid of the legal tender laws.” He explained that currently, the government will not allow anything to compete with the dollar on the national level, elaborating:My goal is to legalize the competition and the people will sort it out. Freedom of choice will sort it out.“My concern is that governments over centuries have been notoriously very eager to have control of the money. Believe me, they will not give up control of money,” he emphasized.Paul was asked to elaborate on what he meant by legalizing the competition. He replied: “Right now, if you buy and sell gold, you get it taxed, they can do that. If you make a profit in bitcoin, you read stories about people being taxed on it. You can’t tax money, you don’t tax it. If you bought a dollar a year ago and it went down 10%, you can’t take a loss because your dollar lost value.”Paul will also be speaking at the Bitcoin 2021 conference Friday. Regarding what he plans to say at the conference, he said: “I will argue more the case for the legalization of freedom of choice, and the people should make decisions and not the government.”He acknowledged that some people are very enthusiastic about bitcoin and think that it is the only money that will exist, replacing the dollar. However, in his opinion:I think the dollar is going to be around but it’s not gonna be worth much.Nonetheless, he noted: “the legal tender laws force you to use legal tender, so they won’t even allow you to replace the dollars with cryptocurrency. There will be laws against that. But, I want to totally legalize it.”He further opined: “I think our problem isn’t the technicality of the gold standards or crypto. Our problems are the dependency on government and less concern about personal liberty. What about property rights and contract rights? This is what we need to be concentrating on.”Do you agree with Dr. Ron Paul on bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

The judge reportedly said that “Youtube and its parent, Google LLC, are protected by the federal law that shields internet platforms from responsibility for content posted by users.”Steve Wozniak has lost his lawsuit against Youtube over bitcoin giveaway scams on the video-sharing platform fraudulently using his name and image. Bloomberg conveyed that Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County said in a tentative ruling Wednesday:Youtube and its parent, Google LLC, are protected by the federal law that shields internet platforms from responsibility for content posted by users.Scammers have been using Youtube to post videos claiming that famous people are giving away bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, such as ether. They promise to double the amount of bitcoin sent to them.Besides Wozniak, scammers have used the names and images of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and Richard Branson. They have also used some well-known people in the crypto space, such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. Bitcoin News reported in July last year that the Elon Musk bitcoin giveaway scam raked in millions of dollars.Wozniak and 17 other fraud victims sued Youtube and Google in July last year. They argued in the lawsuit that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should not apply to their case because Youtube not only failed to remove the scam videos but “materially contributed” to the scam.Wozniak claimed that the video-sharing platform profited from the scam by selling targeted ads, driving traffic to the fraudulent videos after falsely verifying the scammers’ Youtube channels.However, Judge Kulkarnia told Wozniak that those factors were not enough to overcome the immunity provided by Section 230. She gave the Apple co-founder 30 days to revise his complaint.Do you think Youtube is at fault for allowing bitcoin giveaway scams to persist on its platform?

The filing came as the asset management firm’s chief investment officer repeatedly made bearish bitcoin predictions, calling cryptocurrency Tulipmania.Guggenheim Funds Investment Advisors LLC filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday for the Guggenheim Active Allocation Fund. Guggenheim Investments has about $270 billion in total assets under management across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies.The filing describes the fund as “a newly-organized, diversified, closed-end management investment company.” Among the investments that the new fund can invest in are “Cryptocurrency, Digital Assets, or Virtual Currency Investments.” The filing states:The fund may seek investment exposure to cryptocurrency (notably, bitcoin) … through cash settled derivatives instruments, such as cash settled exchange traded futures, or through investment vehicles that offer exposure to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies through direct investments or indirect exposure such as derivatives contracts.After outlining the risks associated with investing in bitcoin, the company noted that the fund’s “exposure to cryptocurrency may change over time and, accordingly, such exposure may not always be represented in the fund’s portfolio.”The Guggenheim filing followed several bearish predictions by the chief investment officer (CIO) of Guggenheim Partners, Scott Minerd, who is also the chairman of Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners.While Minerd has a long-term prediction of $600K for BTC, he has been saying that the price of bitcoin will crash in the short term and could fall 50% to the $20K – $30K level. Last week, he predicted more heavy sell-off for bitcoin after warning of a major correction in April, stating that the cryptocurrency looked “very frothy.”According to the SEC filing, Minerd will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Guggenheim Active Allocation Fund’s portfolio.Minerd tweeted on May 28, “Crypto investors be warned: be prepared for a volatile holiday weekend.” On May 19, he wrote, “Crypto has proven to be Tulipmania. As prices rise, tulip bulbs and cryptocurrencies multiply until supply swamps demand at previous market clearing prices,” elaborating:This is not the death of crypto just as the collapse of Tulipmania was not the end of tulip bulbs.Some people in the crypto community speculate that Minerd made bearish predictions to allow Guggenheim to buy the dip.Guggenheim has another fund that may have exposure to bitcoin. The Guggenheim Macro Opportunities Fund may seek investment exposure to bitcoin indirectly through investing up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), its SEC filing describes.What do you think about Guggenheim launching a fund that could have bitcoin exposure after its CIO called crypto Tulipmania and predicted the price of bitcoin would crash?

870,Asset Manager Sees Bitcoin Price Bottoming out — Says Market Is Mispricing BTC,"Jun 2, 2021","Fund manager Brian Kelly says that the market is mispricing bitcoin and “when bitcoin gets that mispriced it is the sign of the bottom.” He sees a string of “all positive things” that are reflected in the pricing of the cryptocurrency.Brian Kelly, the founder and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM LLC, was asked about where he sees the price of bitcoin heading in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.Kelly manages the BKCM Digital Asset Fund and the REX BKCM Blockchain ETF (NYSE: BKC). He authored “The Bitcoin Big Bang – How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World.” In addition, he was previously a hedge fund manager at Shelter Harbor Capital, where he co-founded. He also co-founded MKM Partners, a brokerage firm catering to institutional investment managers.“For me, when you look at bitcoin, it’s all about network effect and address growth,” the asset manager said. “One of the key metrics I look at when managing crypto money is how fast addresses are growing versus what the market is expecting the addresses to grow.”Referencing his chart, he explained: “Address growth is basically flat but the market is applying we are going to have a decline of 20% in address growth. We haven’t seen that type of differential since March 2020.” Kelly elaborated:Generally, when bitcoin gets that mispriced it is the sign of the bottoming process … The market is mispricing what’s going on underneath the fundamentals underlying bitcoin.He continued: “So we look back to March 2020 when we had a massive divergence when bitcoin was $3,500 and it roared to $60,000. We are looking at the exact same type of situation where it looks like bitcoin is trying to bottom.”As for his fund’s investment, he disclosed that he “personally added to our fund this month because I think it’s that big of an opportunity. In the fund, we are long and getting longer.”The fund manager then opined, “Now what I would like to see, obviously, bitcoin is very momentum driven, so now we need to see more price follow through here and get that momentum going,” emphasizing:To me the story hasn’t changed one bit. We are getting institutional adoption. We’re getting an inflationary hedge and regulatory wise, we are getting watered down regulation. Its not going to be banned, we are talking about bringing it into the fold.He reiterated, “Those are all positive things for me and that to me is reflected in that pricing.”Kelly was then asked about how low the price of bitcoin could fall to and whether $30K was the bottom. “I don’t know if $30,000 was the low,” he admitted. “I have pretty high conviction that it was.” However, he noted that “Bitcoin has a funny way of making you look silly.” He affirmed: “If it got down to $20,000, I would be buying with both of my diamond hands for sure.”Do you agree with Brian Kelly?

He explained that they are both “risk-on” inflation hedges whereas gold is a “risk off” asset.The global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, Jeff Currie, said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that cryptocurrencies are an alternative to copper, not gold, when used as a hedge against inflation. He elaborated:You look at the correlation between bitcoin and copper, or a measure of risk appetite and bitcoin, and we’ve got 10 years of trading history on bitcoin — it is definitely a risk-on asset.He further emphasized that bitcoin and copper act as “risk-on” inflation hedges whereas gold is viewed as a safe haven or a “risk off” asset.The Goldman analyst explained: “There is good inflation and there is bad inflation. Good inflation is when demand pulls it, and that is what bitcoin hedges, that is what copper hedges, that is what oil hedges.” He described:Gold hedges bad inflation, where supply is being curtailed, which is … focused on the shortages on chips, commodities and other types of input raw materials. And you would want to use gold as that hedge.Goldman Sachs also said in a note Monday that commodities remain the best inflation hedge overall.Currie has talked about bitcoin being similar to copper as an inflation hedge before when he said that “bitcoin is the retail inflation hedge.”Goldman Sachs has recently been bullish about bitcoin. The bank said last week that BTC is now a new asset class. The firm formally established a bitcoin trading desk in early May as it sees heavy institutional demand for cryptocurrency.What do you think about bitcoin being similar to copper and not gold as an inflation hedge?

BOND was created by the Bonded.Finance team, as the driver and receipt of value within their platform. BOND will start trading with BTC and USDT pairs.What is Bonded.Finance? With nearly 7000 trackable assets and some 700 exchanges in crypto, it is an understatement to say that liquidity is scattered and that early stage projects as tradable assets make for capricious token holders. Even the meteoric rise of DeFi has done little to change this as lending/borrowing protocols and the true earning potential of tokens are realized only by a select few cryptos. Bonded Finance sees a massive opportunity in this. With crypto maturing as an asset class, there are scores of well-capitalized projects with solid volume and price histories to go with deliverables, yet, they have not been afforded the opportunity to partake in the decentralized financial services movement. Bonded has identified some fifty billion USD in untapped liquidity in this presently underserved altcoin market and has set out to aggregate these tokens to provide DeFi protocols through their algorithm-driven “smart instruments.” Bonded’s aim is to bridge the gap between established and nascent altcoin projects to provide not just traditional and DeFi services but ultimately, to create a network of shared value. What is the BOND token?The Bond token is inherent to the network as the sole driver for the exchange and receipt of value. Network fees, liquidations, collected interest, provider rewards and network incentives are all rewarded to Bond holders and liquidity providers. This stems from Bonded’s decentralized and trustless underpinnings with much of its utility derived from actual revenues. As a decentralized, eventually fully autonomous suite of products, there will be no salaries or overhead or any “off the top,” rather, this end-to-end solution for lending, borrowing, indexing and repurposing of capital and the generated revenues all the flow through the token as the sole incentivizer. Future uses include insurance for borrowers, early access to the Bond stable coin and eventually, full governance. And innovation. Beginning in June, Bonded’s “stacking rewards program,” will grant Bonded liquidity providers tokens from IDOs. These upstart projects are aiming to bolster their go to market strategies by gaining exposure to the Bond community by having the option to open lending markets, see their token represented in a basket of altcoins and ultimately, give them earning power and stability on the open market. As Bonded continues its development, new assets will be available for borrowing and lending, alongside new products including index protocols, synthetic assets and the release of the bToken, Bonded’s hybrid algorithmic stable coin.Strong EndorsementDanish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com Exchange, shared his views on Bonded.Finance, and their respective token BOND: “The team at Bonded.Finance is run by some great individuals, and with this experience have developed a marvelous incentive-heavy network architecture, and still at its infancy. Many projects aim to tackle and gain market share in the lending ecosystem, but do not tackle this in the same way the Bonded.Finance team have. I believe they will be the pioneers in algorithmic smart instruments and decentralised financial products for digital assets.”
Chaudhry continues on by saying; “We’re very excited to see how Bonded.Finance will continue to empower their vision for the future of DeFi, and gain further outreach with our outstanding community at the exchange.”“DeFi products are only as good as their network. Android may have a superior OS but that hasn’t slowed sales of the iPhone. Crypto will be no different but the opportunity is now as everyone jockeys for position in the hopes of not just capturing but keeping users—and that’s asking a lot. For us, that begins by rallying these longstanding communities, giving their token earning power and a reason to hang around. Outside the network, expanding awareness, visibility and opportunity to acquire the Bond token is something we must do in lockstep. Bitcoin.com is a longstanding name and a boutique exchange that we believe will bring in new users and we’re excited to work with them,” states Paul Mak, CEO of Bonded. About Bitcoin.com ExchangeThe mission of Bitcoin.com Exchange is to empower people from all over the world to trade cryptocurrencies with ease and confidence, from first-time traders to advanced trading professionals.

873,$1.4M in Bitcoin Remains Idle — The Curious Case of the 37-Day-Old 2009 Block Reward Spent a Year Ago,"Jun 2, 2021","Approximately 378 days ago, before the bitcoin bull market started to heat up, a unique block was spent stemming from a coinbase reward created 37 days after the Bitcoin network launched. It seems roughly ten coins from the block reward were sold to an exchange, but 40 bitcoin worth $1.4 million at today’s exchange rates sits unspent. Around this time last year, a curious block was spent that invoked a great amount of speculation. On May 20, 2020, an entity spent a coinbase reward that was minted on February 9, 2009. It was widely assumed it may have been related to Satoshi Nakamoto but this assumption has never been verified. What we do know is that it was block reward 3,654 and it was spent 627,404 blocks later, at block height 631,058.We also know that the only transaction associated with the mining of block 3,654 was the coinbase reward. The transfer that took place over a year ago saw the owner of block 3,654 move 10 BTC to one address and 40 BTC to another address. The 10 BTC, worth $372k today, was seemingly sent to an exchange, as data from block explorer oxt.me shows notes from Binance clusters. The 40 BTC, worth $1.4 million today, still remains sitting in the wallet, untouched since it was first moved last May.Of course, users have tried to message the address and send the wallet dust since it was discovered last year. The address has seen approximately 22 transactions but the owner has not sent a single satoshi since the 40 BTC was added. Observers can also see that the owner of the notorious 2009 coinbase reward has not spent the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) or the bitcoinsv (BSV) associated with the reward. When the 50 BTC was moved on May 20, 2020, the bitcoin (BTC) market suddenly dropped 7% in fiat value that day.Spending of 2009 blocks is not common and when they are spent it gets people speculating about Satoshi theories. Even 2010 and 2011 block reward transfers are very interesting, especially since these bitcoins sit idle for over ten years before moving. In 2020 and into 2021, Bitcoin.com News reported on a fascinating 2010 mining whale who spent 10,000 BTC from that year. In fact, the 2010 whale spent the coins in strings of 1,000 BTC each or 20 block rewards at a time.The oldest block to get transferred after the 2009 block processed on May 20, 2020, was mined on April 6, 2010, and transferred on January 3, 2021 (Bitcoin’s launch date anniversary). The last 2009 block reward spent before block 3,654 was transferred in January 2018 which was block 29,953. In fact, a consecutive number (at least 2-4) of 2009 blocks were processed on January 5, 2018. Additionally, the very next day a couple more block rewards mined in December 2009 were transferred.This particular two-day spending spree of 2009 coins in January 2018 was a small string of transfers. The string was preceded by another string of transfers tethered to 2009 block rewards that were moved in November 2017. At that time, blocks mined on December 17, 18, 24, and 27 from 2009 were processed in the midst of the 2017 bitcoin bull run. The most recent 2009 spend was more interesting because of how young it was.On August 7, 2017, a coinbase reward mined on the same exact day as the February 9, 2009 reward was spent, but at block height 3,607. Before that, a couple of blocks mined during that same week in 2009 were transferred in September 2015.Between 2009 and 2011, there are well over a million unspent BTC sitting in idle coinbase rewards and many of these rewards are assumed to be Satoshi’s stash. This is why when the February 2009 block was transferred last May, crypto prices dropped 7% in fear the creator was moving coins. Whoever did move those bitcoins decided that they did not need the 40 BTC worth $1.4 million today.What do you think about old ‘sleeping’ bitcoins from 2009-2011 coinbase rewards? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

874,Artists Plan to Erect a Bronze Satoshi Nakamoto Statue in Budapest to Honor Bitcoin's Creator,"Jun 2, 2021","Hungary plans to be the first country in the world to erect a statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, as a life-size bronze bust of Bitcoin’s creator will be displayed in Budapest. The bronze bust design is being constructed by two sculptors, Tamás Gilly and Réka Gergely.A statue of Satoshi Nakamoto is being created to be erected in Budapest, Hungary when the project is complete. The creators of the bronze bust, Tamás Gilly and Réka Gergely, have recently revealed design plans for the famous cryptocurrency inventor’s statue.Of course, not knowing who the anonymous Nakamoto is makes it very hard to sculpt an image of him, but that’s not stopping Gilly and Gergely.According to the initial design sketches, Satoshi Nakamoto will be a hooded figure that references both the unknown “people of the internet” and Bitcoin’s mysterious creator. The artists and the individual who came up with the idea believe Nakamoto deserves a life-sized bust displayed for all to see.The person who invoked the Satoshi statue idea, András Györfi, told the press that Nakamoto’s true identity does not matter.In fact, below the sculpted hoodie, Nakamoto’s face will be reflective in order to reinforce the concept that “we are all Satoshi Nakamoto,” the creators note.Györfi says that the mysterious cryptocurrency inventor made the world a better place and deserves a statue.Györfi and the sculptors are not the first to come up with a Satoshi statue idea, as an initiative to erect a virtual monument of Satoshi Nakamoto in Kiev took place three years ago. The same year, the first monument dedicated to “Bitcoin and Blockchain” was constructed in the Slovenian city of Kranj.Alongside this, Budapest already has a full-size statue of an anonymous character in a cloaked-hoodie as well. As pictured in the feature image of this article, there’s a bronze statue of “Anonymous” at the Vajdahunyad Castle in Budapest.What do you think about the Satoshi Nakamoto statue being designed to be displayed in Budapest?

875,Cheap Power Is Creating a Bitcoin Mining Boom in Argentina,"Jun 2, 2021","Argentina, the ailing South American country, is experiencing a cryptocurrency mining resurgence due to artificially low power rates maintained by subsidies from the national government. This fact, alongside exchange controls and the possibility of selling obtained assets at a higher exchange rate than the official one, is enticing more and more individuals to enter the mining business.Argentina is experiencing a mining boom, due to the highly subsidized power rates and exchange controls enabling miners to sell their mined bitcoins at a higher exchange rate than the official one established by the government.The surging interest in mining cryptocurrencies also has to do with the fact that Argentina is subject to capital controls that forbid citizens from exchanging more than 200 dollars for their local fiat currency, the peso; this, consequently, has also caused a rise in the demand of other convertible currency to safeguard their buying power from inflation.According to Bloomberg, the subsidies are so high that even with the recent crash in prices, Argentinian miners are still in the green. Nicolas Bourbon, a miner, declared:Even after Bitcoin’s price correction, the cost of electricity for anyone mining from their house is still a fraction of the total revenue generated.This fact has also awakened the interest of foreign mining companies in entering Argentina to take advantage of these subsidies. Bitfarms, a Canada-based mining group, secured a deal to mine using power from a local plant for a far lower rate than most comparable alternatives. Geoffrey Morphy, Bitfarms’ president, stated:We were looking for places that have overbuilt their electrical generation systems. Economic activity in Argentina is down, and power is not being fully utilized. So it was a win-win situation.Argentina is the latest country to turn to crypto and mining as a way of gaining more financial and economic freedom for its citizens while facing economic difficulties, as Iran and Venezuela did before. But this mining boom could well affect the integrity of the power grid, depending on the impact the activities have.This has been the case in Iran, which just recently had to take action banning bitcoin mining until September 22, due to the constant blackouts the power grid is experiencing. Miners in Iran need to be registered to operate legally. However, it is estimated that more than 85% of miners remain unlicensed.What do you think of the recent cryptocurrency mining boom in Argentina? Tell us in the comments section below.

They have attracted the biggest financial institutions to enter the space, including major investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which now offer crypto investments to their clients. A growing number of companies now accept bitcoin for payments, offer crypto-related services, and put BTC on their balance sheets. Goldman Sachs recently said that bitcoin has become a new asset class, seeing huge institutional demand for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s market cap recently surpassed a trillion dollars.Governor Ingves opined:When something gets big enough, things like consumer interests and money laundering come into play. So there’s good reason to believe that [regulation] will happen.Sweden’s Minister for Financial Markets, Asa Lindhagen, revealed the government is already working on tightening the standards for crypto exchanges, the publication conveyed. However, she noted that it is a “work in progress at the international level,” pointing out that cross-border cooperation with other governments is necessary to address the risk of money laundering involving cryptocurrencies.Riksbank Deputy Governor Per Jansson raised concerns on Tuesday that the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies keeps fluctuating excessively and they have “nothing concrete or substantial” underpinning their actual value.What do you think about the comments by the Swedish central banker?

877,Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model Still Intact — 'Starting to look like 2013' S2F Creator Says,"Jun 1, 2021","The creator of the popular bitcoin price model called stock-to-flow (S2F or S2FX) has added a new dot to his notorious chart. Plan B said on Tuesday that “we knew bitcoin would not go up in a straight line” and added that the market action is “starting to look like 2013.”“Plan B,” is a pseudonym leveraged by the Twitter account @100trillionusd and since March 22, 2019, he’s been documenting his popular stock-to-flow (S2F) price model. Similar to the tools and technical analysis models Bitcoin.com News has written about in recent days like the Golden Ratio Multiplier and Logarithmic Growth Curves, Plan B’s model is extremely popular and he recently updated it to the stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) model.Basically, the model quantifies BTC’s scarcity in a similar fashion to scarce assets like gold. It then leverages the bitcoin in circulation and quantifies it by yearly issuance with reward halvings as well.At the time of publication, the Bitcoin network’s inflation rate per annum is approximately 1.77% and a circulating supply of 18,723,781 BTC. Despite bitcoin losing 53% from it’s all-time high of over $64k to a low of $30k in 30 days, Plan B still confirms the S2FX model is “intact.” Moreover, current charts look awfully familiar as Plan B expressed that things are looking like 2013 right now.“New dot: May close $37,341.. -35% .. we knew bitcoin would not go up in a straight line and several -35% drops are possible (and indeed likely) in a bull market,” Plan B tweeted. “Starting to look like 2013. S2F(X) model intact,” the popular Twitter account told his 523,000 followers. Plan B further added:2nd bounce off the lower band of S2F model. Will S2F break? Or will this turn out to be an excellent buy signal? I know multiple hedge funds that actually trade this BTC-S2F ‘cointegration’ (despite that we can’t formally use cointegration tests because S2F ratio isn’t random). Moreover, Plan B also started a poll on Twitter that asked his followers if they thought the S2F model would break or will it turn out to be an excellent buy signal. Out of over 15,000 votes so far, 54.7% think it’s a “buy signal,” while 17.4% think “S2F will break.” One individual responded and said BTC would go “back to $20k and bounce.” Others who believe its an excellent “buy signal,” said the question was a “no brainer.”Plan B was also asked “How do you define break? 2stdev or 1stdev band?” The S2F creator responded and noted: “Let’s say break out of the 1stdev band and stay below $100k this year. i.e. 1 outlier will not break it, but structurally below model breaks it. Formulas and stats are in the s2f paper, so you could define it better.”Bitcoin prices tried to surpass $38k this past weekend but bulls have failed to push the value past that range. Plan B is not the only market observer that has said the current market cycle looks like “2013.” On May 23, Bitcoin.com News reported on a number of traders and crypto proponents who believe the current cycle is very similar to 2013’s double top bull run.What do you think about Plan B’s updated S2F chart with the new dot? Do you think S2F break? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

878,BNY Mellon Sets Up Crypto Unit in Ireland as Central Bank Says Bitcoin Is ‘of Great Concern’,"May 31, 2021","U.S. banking corporation BNY Mellon is gearing up to offer crypto custody services out of Dublin where it has just established a digital hub. The news coincided with a stark warning issued by a top central bank official in Ireland who said people should only buy bitcoin if they’re prepared to lose money.Following a decision to enter the cryptocurrency space announced in February, the Bank of New York Mellon has now created a “Digital Innovation Hub” in Dublin. The unit will act as a custodian for crypto assets, the Business Post reported, noting that with the move, “the banking giant, is betting on the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”The hub will allow clients to hold, transfer and issue digital assets, the Irish publication detailed. Custodial services will be provided for a variety of assets including the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, bitcoin (BTC), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).BNY Mellon is America’s oldest banking institution through its predecessor, Bank of New York, which merged with the Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007. It’s also the world’s largest custodian bank and asset servicing company. As of March 31, the bank has $41.7 trillion assets under custody or administration and $2.2 trillion assets under management.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently operates in 35 different countries, according to its website. It maintains presence in the Republic of Ireland since 1994, and its new crypto asset unit in Dublin will be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI).Soon after the news about BNY Mellon’s involvement with digital assets came out, a high-ranking official of the Central Bank of Ireland was quoted warning that the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin is “of great concern.” In an interview with Bloomberg, CBI’s Director-General for Financial Conduct, Derville Rowland, stated that “crypto assets are quite a speculative, unregulated investment.”Rowland, who is associated with the bank’s recent enforcement investigations, also stressed that people who want to invest in cryptocurrencies should be “really aware they could lose the whole of that investment.” Her department is known for imposing hefty fines on some of Ireland’s biggest financial companies.The CBI has already fined or is still investigating most Irish retail banks for mortgage overcharging. Earlier this year, the central bank fined Ireland’s biggest securities firm, Davy. The company has since been put up for sale following the resignations of its top managers. Speaking about the case, Rowland said that Davy needs to “look in the mirror” and ask itself “how things went so catastrophically wrong.”With her latest comments regarding cryptocurrencies, Derville Rowland joins a group of other central bank officials who have warned against crypto investments. Among them is Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey who recently reaffirmed his skepticism about crypto-assets and insisted they are “dangerous” to the public. Rowland is now preparing to take over as Chair of the Investment Management Standing Committee at ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority, in July.What’s your opinion on Derville Rowland’s comments about cryptocurrencies and do you think other banks like BNY Mellon will establish crypto units in Ireland? Tell us in the comments section below.

879,Marathon's Bitcoin Mining Pool Will 'No Longer Filter Transactions' — Marapool Begins Signaling for Taproot,"May 31, 2021","On Monday, the publicly-listed enterprise mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings announced the company has adopted the latest codebase offered by Bitcoin Core developers that features Taproot. Marathon is now signaling for Taproot according to the announcement. The North American bitcoin miner further noted that the firm’s mining operation Marapool will “cease filtering transactions.”The firm Marathon Digital Holdings (Nasdaq: MARA), has been making a number of business moves in the bitcoin mining sector in 2021. In December 2020, the firm announced the purchase of 70,000 Antminer S19 bitcoin miners from Bitmain for $170 million. Last week, Marathon revealed that Compute North’s mining farm in Texas will host 73,000 of Marathon’s mining rigs. Furthermore, in more recent times, Marathon made headlines for censoring specific bitcoin transactions in a mined BTC block.At that time, Marathon revealed to the public that Marapool dedicated 10.37 exahash toward mining KYC/OFAC compliant transactions only. Although, on May 31, Marathon explained in its Taproot signaling announcement that the bitcoin mining pool will “cease filtering transactions.” The company said that the North American mining pool Marapool “has adopted and implemented Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1.”The new 0.21.1 codebase hosts the Taproot feature, an addition that developers say will add privacy enhancements, scaling improvements, and other technical advancements.“Marathon is committed to the core tenets of the Bitcoin community, including decentralization, inclusion, and no censorship,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s CEO. The company’s mining pool will “no longer filter transactions” and “begin validating transactions in a manner consistent with all other miners who use the standard node,” the announcement emphasizes.“Over the coming week, we will be updating all our miners to the full standard Bitcoin core 0.21.1 node, including support for Taproot,” Thiel said during the announcement. “By adopting the full standard Bitcoin core node, we will be validating transactions on the blockchain in the exact same way as all other miners who use the standard node,” the Marathon CEO added.Taproot is in the midst of “Speedy Trial,” an activation mechanism that was initiated on May 1. Basically miners are dealing with six sub-phases between each difficulty change. During the last difficulty change, more than 95% of miners were signaling for Taproot activation. Taproot’s actual ruleset will be followed in November and enforced via soft fork at block height 709,632.“We look forward to continue being a collaborative and supportive member of the Bitcoin community,” Thiel further remarked. “And to realizing the vision of Bitcoin as the first decentralized, peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users rather than a central authority or middlemen,” he added.What do you think about Marathon signaling Taproot and detailing that Marapool will cease filtering transactions?

880,Visualizing Bitcoin's Future Price Cycles With the Power-Law Corridor Model,"May 31, 2021","There’s a number of tools, charts, and models traders use to help them forecast bitcoin price cycles and our last article discussed leveraging the Golden Ratio Multiplier. The following editorial discusses another method of bitcoin price prediction analysis by utilizing Logarithmic Growth Curves. In September 2019, a comprehensive paper published by Harold Christopher Burger describes how crypto proponents can visualize bitcoin price cycles using the Power-Law Corridor model. In order to give our readers some deeper perspective, Bitcoin.com News has been covering a few useful price models that technical analysts and crypto traders leverage to forecast bitcoin’s future prices.The previous report discussed the Golden Ratio Multiplier and how bitcoiners can use the well known golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence to predict future values. The next subject takes a look at how crypto enthusiasts can use Logarithmic Growth Curves to get some perspective on bitcoin (BTC) price cycles.Essentially, logarithmic growth is the inverse of exponential swelling and it is much slower than rapid and aggressive growth. Logarithmic growth is leveraged in biology and various sciences but exponential and logarithmic functions can be used in finance as well.Bitcoin’s price timeline can be seen from a logarithmic perspective. In fact, a log price chart is one of the most popular in the world of crypto and traditional finance technical analysis. In simple terms, a crypto asset’s log chart leverages conventional percentage rates and all spacing is equivalent to scale.Even the most basic of logarithmic BTC charts, the individual can get an entirely different look than the typical crypto price charts using candlesticks and different time frames. Additionally, bitcoin traders can look at the crypto asset’s Logarithmic Growth Curves model which gives even more perspective.This particular Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC) price model hosted on lookintobitcoin.com (chart shown above) was created by Cole Garner and @quantadelic. Further, the price model was also “inspired by the work of Harold Christopher Burger,” the website notes.Harold Christopher Burger published a comprehensive study on LGC in his paper called “Bitcoin’s natural long-term power-law corridor of growth.” When Burger wrote the paper in 2019, he mentioned a number of individuals like John McAfee ($1M), and Nouriel Roubini ($0) forecasting outlandish price predictions.In his editorial, Burger looks at bitcoin’s (BTC) full price history from a logarithmic point of view. Essentially, Burger describes BTC’s possible future price patterns with the power-law or Power Law Corridor (PLC) model.Burger said at the time, he is “quite confident in the long-term, the price will indeed evolve approximately as stated” in his article. His study notes that bitcoin follows a price corridor that can be divided into two bands.“One which lies at the lower-end of the price predictions and is rather thin, the other one being much larger and lying at the higher-end predictions,” the analyst’s paper details. “Bitcoin’s price spends about equal amounts of time in both bands. This implies that large bubbles and busts are likely to continue to exist.”The researcher that blogs for Quantodian Publications explains that the price model helps people determine the market’s entry and exit points. “This model allows us to make broad predictions concerning the long-term future price of bitcoin,” the blog post emphasizes referring to two forecasts.After doing some math, equations, and linear regression, Burger found that a basic level of support for BTC’s price followed a power-law. He performed the linear regression with bitcoin’s price peaks in 2011, 2013, and 2017.“The market tops also seem to follow a power-law,” Burger said. “If the next market top also follows this power-law, the market top will lie on this line. The slope of this power-law is 5.02927337, whereas the fit on all data gave us a somewhat larger slope of 5.84509376. This indicates a relative taming of bitcoin bull markets compared to the overall trend-line,” the author added.When Burger quantified these measurements defined by the three bitcoin market price highs and coefficient of determination, the researcher came up with two power-laws. He also leveraged random sample consensus, or RANSAC to get more data points.The researcher then found two modes, one normal and one bull, and was further able to formulate different power-law models for BTC’s price. Burger shows a chart that includes “power-law fit,” “power-law fit minus bias,” “power-law fit on only three tops,” and “robust fit.”“We now have various models to predict the future price of bitcoin. All we have to do is extend the graph,” Burger blog post notes. The researcher adds:We can further divide this corridor into two bands, one corresponding to the “normal” mode and one corresponding to the ‘bull’ mode. The price has so far spent half the time in the lower ‘normal mode’ band, and the rest of the time in the higher ‘bull mode’ band.The power-law corridor of growth blog post written by Burger has followed bitcoin’s price movements pretty well since it was published. The Quantodian Publications author does note, however, when he was modeling a support line for bitcoin’s price to follow a power-law that there was one instance in 2010, where the price of BTC breached below the line.Since the blog post was published on September 4, 2019, there is a second instance where bitcoin’s price breached the “robust fit” line.This specific time was during the financial meltdown on March 12, 2020, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday,’ when BTC and nearly every asset in the world saw values sink. March 12 was considered a freak instance and possibly an outlier because of the fear and shock Covid-19 brought to financial markets.Lastly, the current chart shows bitcoin went through a bullish cycle in recent times, but hasn’t peaked like the rest of the bull cycles. In fact, the chart shows the northbound price climax plateaued much lower than the other peaks and the price has started to head southbound.What do you think about log charts, power-law, and utilizing Logarithmic Growth Curves to predict bitcoin price cycles?

881,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Experiences This Year's Largest Epoch Drop, Global Hashrate Slips Lower","May 31, 2021","Bitcoin’s mining difficulty dropped this week at block height 685,440 and saw the largest negative drop of the year losing close to 16%. Overall the global hashrate has dropped around 2% since the price fell below the $40k handle. Currently, the mining difficulty is around 21 trillion, and it could drop another 16% in less than two weeks.The price of bitcoin (BTC) has seen better days and following the drop in price, the hashrate has also slowed down to a certain degree. On May 29, 2021, at block height 685,440 the Bitcoin network’s mining difficulty slid by 15.97%, which is the largest epoch drop of 2021.It also follows the largest difficulty rise in 2021, which occurred at block height 683,424. At that time, the mining difficulty jumped over 21.5% and the global hashrate was around 179.2 EH/s on May 13.Right now, the mining difficulty is expected to drop even more in 12 days around 15.69% according to data. That percentage drop would equal a difficulty drop from the current 21.05 trillion difficulty to 17.75 trillion. A 16% difficulty drop is a sizable swing, seeing how the largest drop in 2021 was around 12.6%. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s hashrate is around the 135 to 150 EH/s range.Overall hashrate has slid roughly 2% since dropping below $40,000 per BTC but since May 9, it’s dropped roughly 35% from 214 EH/s to 135 EH/s. With the difficulty lowered, there’s a great number of pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain. Currently, 20 mining pools are processing BTC blocks and F2pool commands the top position with 23.25 EH/s or over 15% of the hashrate.F2pool is followed by Viabtc, Btc.com, Antpool, Poolin, Binance Pool, Foundry USA, and 1thash. Since January 2018, the Bitcoin network has seen 91 consecutive difficulty changes and only 25 of them were downward drops. This means during the last three years, more than 72% of the time, the difficulty increased every two weeks.What do you think about bitcoin’s mining difficulty dropping close to 16%?

883,Sichuan Energy Officials Plan to Meet in June to Discuss Bitcoin Mining Implications,"May 31, 2021","Ever since government officials in China started talking about cracking down on bitcoin mining and reiterating crypto guidelines from 2017, digital currency proponents and the media have been focused on this region. Just recently, a Chinese state-backed online publication revealed that the Sichuan Energy Regulatory Office plans to hold a meeting on June 2, 2021, to discuss the implications of bitcoin mining. In recent times, the Chinese government has been discussing the crypto economy to a greater degree and much of the conversation has been directed at bitcoin mining.China’s officials hope to get the country carbon neutral by the year 2060 and capture a good percentage of carbon neutrality by 2030. Following a few meetings from the country’s Financial Stability Board and other Chinese politicians, a number of crypto firms stopped offering services to mainland citizens.Companies that started severing services from China included Huobi, Btc.top, Hashcow, and Okex. Three days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on statements about the situation from a number of executives from China’s pool operators and mining rig manufacturers.A recently published report this weekend details that the Sichuan Energy Regulatory Office plans to hold a meeting next week in order to tend to the implications of bitcoin mining.The columnist from the nation-state backed publication the Global Times states:The Sichuan Energy Regulatory Office announced on Thursday that the office will hold a meeting on June 2 to fully understand the situation of crypto-currency mining activities in the southwestern province, which is required by the National Energy Administration.The regional reporter, Colin ‘Wu’ Blockchain, further noted on Twitter before the weekend that there were “rumors that China will introduce a crackdown policy on Friday night.”However, these rumors never came to fruition and instead, the Sichuan Energy Regulatory meeting was disclosed to the public. Estimates say that the Sichuan province and Xinjiang region in China is a deeply concentrated area of bitcoin miners.On Sunday, May 30, 2021, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate has been hovering just above 165 exahash per second (EH/s). Stats show that the top mining pools with the most hashrate stem from China.Today’s top mining pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain include F2pool, Antpool, Viabtc, Btc.com, and Poolin. The aforementioned mining operations that reside in China command roughly 66.32% of the global hashrate on Sunday.What do you think about the upcoming Sichuan Energy Regulatory Office meeting to discuss bitcoin mining?

884,"UK Police Raid Alleged Cannabis Farm, Finds Bitcoin Mining Facility Stealing Power","May 31, 2021","Police from the UK executed a raid in an industrial unit in the West Midlands county expecting to find a cannabis farm, but instead found a big bitcoin mining facility, that was coincidentally bypassing the controls from the local power utility company to siphon energy from the main grid, stealing thousands of pounds in the process.The West Midlands Police Department got a real surprise last week when they raided an alleged cannabis farm in an industrial premise, just to find the facility was used to operate a Bitcoin mine. According to reports from intelligence, all of the signs suggested the site was used as a cannabis-growing farm. The West Midlands police department stated in its report that:We heard how lots of people were visiting the unit at different times of day, lots of wiring and ventilation ducts were visible, and a police drone picked up a considerable heat source from above. They are all classic cannabis factory signsThe mining facility had 100 S9s (one of the most popular bitcoin mining ASICs) working all day, giving the site a heated print pretty similar to the one of a cannabis farm. However, upon further inspection and after making inquiries with the local power utility company, the police found the facility was bypassing the local power utility company controls, using power directly from the source and stealing thousands of pounds of electricity in the process. Sandwell Police Sergeant Jennifer Griffin stated:We’ve seized the equipment and will be looking into permanently seizing it under the Proceeds of Crime Act. No-one was at the unit at the time of the warrant and no arrests have been made – but we’ll be making enquiries with the unit’s owner.As it is known, bitcoin mining is a very energy-intensive task, and machines used for this purpose spend big amounts of energy to secure the network. This fact has made cryptocurrency mining-related power theft a common occurrence. There have been several electricity theft cases in China and in Malaysia, where miners have stolen millions of dollars while operating their mining facilities.If miners bypass the local controls and connect their machines directly to the grids, the energy consumption might be too much for the power network to handle. Iran is now facing electricity problems, with its government banning Bitcoin mining due to the blackouts its network is facing with the high demand for electricity for these purposes.What do you think of this Bitcoin mining-related raid? Tell us in the comments section below.

885,"Chinese Economist Says if Bitcoin Is Widely Adopted: 'We're All Going to Die, This Is Not a Joke'","May 30, 2021","A Chinese economist and assistant director at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University, Qu Qiang, has predicted that “We’re all going to die” if bitcoin becomes widely adopted as a currency. He foresees our society falling into “a death spiral of deflation,” noting that “the whole society is going to shrink and self-explode.”An assistant director at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University, Qu Qiang, was interviewed on CGTN about bitcoin. CGTN is owned by the Chinese state media China Central Television (CCTV). The video of his interview was shared on Twitter Thursday by Hailey Lennon, who said she walked into her hotel room and it was playing on TV.Qu was asked: “Can you give me the worst scenario, what kind of a systemic shock it will give to the current financial system if bitcoin is widely used in China or the rest of the world?” He replied:I can tell you exactly what’s going to happen … We’re all going to die. This is not a joke.His answer was what he called “The worst scenario or the must scenario” that will happen if bitcoin were to become “the ultimate type of currency” and “adopted by all human society.”Qu then pointed out that “Bitcoin has a very, very strict, limited total number, which means this is a deflation currency,” noting that it will not expand the amount as human development grows.Consequently, he asserted that with bitcoin adoption, our society will fall into “a death spiral of deflation.” He elaborated: “The whole society is going to shrink and self-explode. That’s what happened at the end of the Ming dynasty when they were short on silver.”Qu graduated and received his doctorate in economics from Renmin University of China, where he is now a professor and a doctoral advisor. He currently serves as the external supervisor of the Bank of Beijing and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Among numerous positions he is holding is a director of the China Financial Policy Research Centre, a key research center of humanities and social sciences of the Chinese Ministry of Education.Bitcoiners had a field day over Qu’s comments on social media. Many just laughed excessively, with some calling the whole thing an “ultimate FUD” and “state-sanctioned bullshit propaganda.”Some debunked his silver theory. One person tweeted: “Ming dynasty collapsed for many reasons but a deflationary silver spiral ain’t one of them,” citing work by Richard von Glahn, who wrote, “This hypothesis rests on dubious theoretical and empirical grounds.”Many mocked his knowledge of the fall of the Ming dynasty. One person suggested: “This could easily be a SNL [Saturday Night Live] skit except funnier.” Another exclaimed: “End of the world. Beware.” A third person said, “I didn’t know bitcoin ended the Ming dynasty.” A fourth person chimed in, “Imagine if we had hodled since the 15th century.”One user got more serious and stated that “for the record, he [Qu] is clueless about Ming dynasty.” Quoting the British Museum’s history of the world, he wrote: “The Ming … state issued too much paper money, however, causing hyper-inflation. By 1425 paper money was worth only a seventieth of its original value and the use of paper currency in China was suspended.”What do you think about Qu’s comments on bitcoin?

886,"Financial Guru Dave Ramsey Advises Whether One Should Invest in Bitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies","May 30, 2021","Financial guru Dave Ramsey has given advice on whether one should invest in cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin. Ramsey sees cryptocurrency as a get-rich-quick scheme, preferring to make his money in a “methodical” and “boring” way.Dave Ramsey has given advice on cryptocurrency investing. Michael from Dayton, Ohio, called into The Ramsey Show saying that he had been looking into cryptocurrency and asked whether he should be investing in it. The episode, entitled “Should I Invest in Cryptocurrency?” was aired on May 20. Michael is 24 years old and has saved up $3,800 from working his job. He told Ramsey: “I just want to know what are the best investments to really look at and where to go about it.”The self-proclaimed personal money management expert, Ramsey calls himself “America’s trusted voice on money.” He is the author of seven best-selling books: Financial Peace, More Than Enough, The Total Money Makeover, EntreLeadership, Dave Ramsey’s Complete Guide to Money, The Legacy Journey, and Smart Money Smart Kids. Altogether, they have sold more than 11 million copies.“You have to set your investment goals with what you believe is your best path to becoming wealthy, otherwise you wouldn’t do the investment, right?” Ramsey began. Michael agreed.Ramsey proceeded to share his investment experience. “When I was 24, I made a lot of mistakes, buying things that I thought would make me wealthy, quickly and easily,” he detailed, adding that for example, he “bought a lot of nothing-down real estate” and “went broke as a result.”He also “bought gold futures,” putting all of his $5,000 he had at the time in it. He followed the strategy of a “gold guy,” who “had hit 14 times in a row on his prediction.” Ramsey stood to make $50K if this prediction hit. However, “he missed on that try and my little bitty $5,000 net worth was just evaporated based on my attempt to make $50K in 90 days off of $5,000,” he shared.Turning to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Ramsey described: “Bitcoin’s hot. Crypto’s hot. A lot of people are making a lot of money on it right now.” However, he emphasized: “It is as you said, Michael, very very volatile and so it falls for me, an old guy, under the heading of getting rich quick and I have not found many people that get rich quick. And I don’t like losing money.” Ramsay then advised:You can certainly do what you want to do but you called here. We do not tell people to invest in highly volatile, unpredictable investments. And currencies of any kind fall in that category. Bitcoin will be the most volatile among those, crypto would be the most volatile among those.Nonetheless, Ramsey acknowledged that there is a chance of making money with volatile assets. He referenced a guy who called into his show, who put $3,500 into Gamestop and made $50,000. The finance guru commented, “It was interesting to watch from the outside.”He opined: “I think you’ve got a better shot at bitcoin than you do the lotto, that’s all I’m saying, but both of them are dumb ideas in my mind and I didn’t put any money in either one of them. I’ve never bought a scratch-off ticket in my entire life.”Reiterating that he just doesn’t like giving his money away, Ramsey said that “If I’m gonna have fun that way, I’m gonna roll down the window, throw $100 bills and cause traffic jams going down the interstate. That’s more fun.” He further noted:Of course everybody that’s a bitcoin genius right now thinks Dave Ramsey’s an out of touch boomer, which is probably true, but I’m also worth several hundred million dollars so let’s go figure that out.He then discussed that the investments depend on the investor’s risk tolerance and goal. He proceeded to compare beanie babies to BTC, stating that for him, “that’s right up there in bitcoin.”“The thing is, Michael, you can invest in whatever you want but the data points tell us that people who do get rich quick don’t. That’s the bottom line,” Ramsey said.“Out of studying 10,000 millionaires, the number of them that got rich quick is very, very, very small,” he affirmed, adding that they were “methodical and boring and didn’t have a good story to tell their golf course buddy … they just were methodical, they were boring and that’s what I’ve done.”What do you think about Dave Ramsey’s advice on whether to invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?

887,EZ Blockchain Partners With Texas-Based Oil Provider to Monetize Wasted Natural Gas With Bitcoin,"May 30, 2021","While a number of media pundits and politicians have been talking about Bitcoin’s energy consumption, there’s been a myriad of firms working toward green solutions well before all the controversy. Unfortunately, critics don’t highlight the amount of renewables miners use or the cogeneration applications. One project called EZ Blockchain has partnered with the Texas-based oil and gas service provider, Silver Energy to monetize wasted natural gas with bitcoin, while reducing emissions.A firm called EZ Blockchain recently detailed that the company has partnered with Silver Energy, an oil and gas provider based in Texas. According to the firm, the team installed Silver Energy’s first mining site at the company’s Alberta, Canada location in February 2021.After the installation of Microbt Whatsminers, EZ Blockchain said that the project reached around 1 megawatt of power consumption. All of the power is “processed from 250 MCFd of stranded natural gas using a gas-electric generator,” the company’s blog post notes.“Today oil and gas producers are implementing Bitcoin mining in the oil field as a part of their ESG policy more often,” the cofounder and CEO of EZ Blockchain, Sergii Gerasymovych said in the report. Gerasymovych added:Bitcoin mining’s enormous power consumption can solve environmental problems caused by gas flaring and leaking wells. Since Silver Energy is an oil and gas service company, it was a natural symbiosis for EZ Blockchain to work with them.Natural gas is a byproduct of oil extraction and oil providers either have to flare the gas or use it in some other way. The World Bank estimates 5.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is flared annually into the atmosphere.EZ Blockchain’s manufacturing production line designs and manufactures mobile data centers that act as a flare mitigation system. The company says that the Silver Energy project took three days to construct and it was fully operational by March 2021.“We’ve had the privilege of working with EZ Blockchain over the last year. Their support in getting our mine up and running was invaluable, saving us countless hours and maximizing uptime,” Joel Gordon, Silver Energy president and CEO explained.According to EZ Blockchain’s website, the company has expanded quite a bit since it started in 2017 and now has headquarters in Chicago, LA, and Estonia. To date, EZ Blockchain has 35 MW produced and installed and 20 MW more in production.The firm is not the only company producing mobile bitcoin mining data centers, as the Canadian business Upstream Data also offers stranded gas solutions. Moreover, Crusoe Energy Systems a U.S.-based business offers similar crypto mining solutions for oil and gas producers as well.What do you think about EZ Blockchain partnering with Silver Energy to mine bitcoin with excess gas?

889,"Market Forecaster Jim Bianco Says Ethereum Has a Lot of Upside, Investor Doesn't Hold Bitcoin","May 29, 2021","On May 27, the president of Bianco Research, Jim Bianco explained during an interview that he believes there’s a lot of upside potential when it comes to the crypto economy. Bianco said since 2017 he’s owned a basket of crypto assets like ethereum, but he doesn’t hold bitcoin.Bianco Research, L.L.C. is a service provider that offers qualitative and quantitative macro investment analysis for the institutional investor. The company’s president and market analyst, Jim Bianco, sat down with the hosts of CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday to discuss the crypto economy. Bianco is a believer in digital currencies and has been investing for the last four years, collecting a basket of crypto assets since then.However, Bianco doesn’t own bitcoin (BTC) and he believes “coins like ethereum are going to be a lot higher way down the road.” Even though this may be the case, Bianco stressed that crypto investors will have to deal with some busts and booms along the way.“You’re going to have to stomach through much more of what we saw in the last week coming in the next several months or year or so,” Bianco remarked.Bianco has also been a staunch critic of the Federal Reserve’s monetary expansion over the last year and recently opposed Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s “transitory” inflation statement. The Bianco Research executive doesn’t believe it will be temporary and said America will see “non-transitory inflation.” Up until March 9, 2020, Bianco said he was a “bond bull” but quickly reconsidered the optimism after the 10-year Treasury bond dropped to 32 basis points.As far as cryptocurrencies are concerned, Bianco told the hosts of CNBC’s Trading Nation:That’s got a lot of promise, and that’s really what’s significant. The problem is the other driver is kind of an out-of-control casino with people betting on these coins going up and down.The analyst warns, however, that crypto-assets can plunge 50-70% in value because the technology is so new. Nevertheless, after crypto assets fulfill an “adoption phase,” Bianco thinks digital currencies will be a mainstay in the global economy.“That means from that point forward the gains will be a lot less,” Bianco said. “The risk and the reward is now you’ll have less risk and less reward once it gets adopted and the volatility slows down.”Furthermore, Bianco noted that crypto assets are showing correlations to other risk assets like equities and gaining exposure to these new assets is key. “That wasn’t the case three or four years ago. But it is the case now,” Bianco concluded during his interview. “If we were to get higher financial market volatility either in the stock market like the VIX index, that could help bolster the cryptocurrency space as a belief, yes, we need a new fix, and this is the fix,” he added.What do you think about Jim Bianco’s opinion about the crypto economy and his prediction that ethereum will see a lot more upside potential?

890,Spiral Out — Using the Golden Ratio and Fibonacci sequence to Predict Bitcoin Price Cycles,"May 29, 2021","The leading crypto asset bitcoin has seen its value drop more than 53% from its all-time high above the $64k handle, sliding to a low of $30k on May 19. While bitcoin is still down 25% during the last 30 days, it’s hard to forecast where bitcoin’s value is going from here. Although a number of people leverage indicators like the Golden Ratio Multiplier, Fibonacci sequence, logarithmic growth curves, and tools such as the infamous stock-to-flow (S2F) price model to predict future bitcoin valuations.Most people can’t predict the future and when it comes to bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto economy, in general, as busts and booms are common. Moreover, lots of times busts and booms are unpredictable except for a few occasions like specific news stories that shake investors. However, there’s a plethora of technical analysis tools, charts, and models that help a great number of people get ahead of the game.For instance, fans of technical analysis leverage the perspective of the golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence in order to predict future bitcoin valuations. Essentially a trader will apply mathematics to things like bitcoin’s value and moving averages. The golden ratio is also known as divine section, divine proportion, the number phi, extreme and mean ratio, and the golden number. Essentially in the “science of quantity,” two quantities reach a mathematical divine section when their ratio is equal to the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.The golden ratio is equal to 1.618 and it’s not only used in mathematics, but it also appears in architecture, geometry, and many natural elements. Then there’s the classical example of mathematics called the Fibonacci sequence, which is a sequence of quantities where a number is the addition of the last two quantities, starting with 0, and 1. The Golden Ratio Multiplier hosted on lookintobitcoin.com gives a detailed description of how the multiplier works with the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC).“Bitcoin’s adoption curve and market cycles to understand how price may behave on medium to long term time frames,” the website notes. “To do this it uses multiples of the 350 day moving average (350DMA) of Bitcoin’s price to identify areas of potential resistance to price movements.” Lookintobitcoin.com further adds:Multiples are of the 350DMA’s price values rather than its number of days. The multiples reference the Golden Ratio (1.6) and the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). These are important mathematical numbers. These specific multiplications of the 350DMA have been very effective over time at picking out intracycle highs for Bitcoin price and also the major market cycle highs.The Golden Ratio Multiplier, as it is applied to bitcoin price predictions, was invoked by Philip Swift when he published an article on the subject on June 17, 2019. The article titled: “The Golden Ratio Multiplier: Unlocking the mathematically organic nature of Bitcoin adoption,” helps a trader get more perspective on multi-year cycles.“The article starts by noting how the 350-day moving average has acted as an axis for Bitcoin’s major market cycles – once we break out, a new BTC bull run begins,” Swift tweeted two years ago. Swift continued further by saying:The new insight begins when that important moving average is multiplied by key numbers: the golden ratio (1.618) and numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21). In doing so we are able to pick out almost all the major intracycle price highs in Bitcoin’s history (coloured lines) AND each market cycle top (dotted lines). See 2015-17 bull run as a clear example of the MA multipliers acting as major resistance at the intracycle highs.Of course, not everyone agrees with using the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence to predict bitcoin busts and booms. For instance, Alvaro Fernández from the open insurance platform Nsure Network remarked: “Historically it seemed to be respected, but how much could you trust it? We might as well pass through the first accumulation high.” Other critics believe using the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence is no different than using tarot cards.Despite the skeptics, Swift’s bitcoin tool the Golden Ratio Multiplier is well respected and used by a myriad of technical analysts. The golden ratio has been utilized since the time of the ancient Greeks and many believe it’s deeply associated with the universe and nature. Similar to the golden ratio, Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is a renowned and irrational technology by design. Interestingly, bitcoin’s epic price rise since it was first traded has followed the number phi and Fibonacci sequence patterns intimately.In the same way as the Golden Ratio Multiplier, the leading asset has followed succinctly with a “natural long-term power-law corridor of growth,” according to Harold Christopher Burger. Burger published a comprehensive article that discusses bitcoin’s logarithmic growth curves. Like Swift’s Golden Ratio Multiplier, logarithmic growth curves can also give a trader an idea of when they can expect busts and booms and specific time frames. But these tools have allegedly been debunked on occasion and the golden ratio is often considered a fairytale.Similar to the Nautilus shell, bitcoin’s price has often been associated with the golden mean and Fibonacci sequence. The Nautilus shell is often compared and associated with the golden ratio, but contrarian research and further considerations say that the famous shell shape is not a good example of the golden ratio logarithmic spiral found in nature. Studies show the Nautilus shell has phi proportions but follows a 4:3 ratio.What do you think about using the golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence to predict future bitcoin prices?

891,US Sends Bitcoin ATM Operator to Prison for Illegal Operation — 17 Machines Seized,"May 29, 2021","A bitcoin ATM operator has been sent to federal prison for two years for running an illegal cryptocurrency exchange operation. U.S. authorities have seized 17 bitcoin ATMs, along with some cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday that a California man, Kais Mohammad, has been sentenced to two years in federal prison “for operating illegal ATM network that laundered bitcoin and cash for criminals.”The Justice Department said that the 37-year-old operated an illegal crypto business “that exchanged up to $25 million,” some of which were “on behalf of criminals through in-person transactions and a network of bitcoin ATM-type kiosks.”The Yorba Linda resident pleaded guilty in September last year to “a three-count criminal information charging him with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, money laundering, and failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program,” the DOJ described, adding:Mohammad has agreed to forfeit to the government 17 bitcoin ATMs, $22,820 in cash, 18.4 bitcoin and 222.5 ethereum cryptocurrency.Mohammad owned and operated Herocoin from December 2014 to November 2019 using the moniker “Superman29.” Herocoin was a crypto exchange business that charged commissions of up to 25%, which was “significantly above the prevailing market rate,” the DOJ noted.He typically met his clients at a public location and exchanged currency for them. “Mohammad generally did not inquire as to the source of the clients’ funds and, on certain occasions, he knew the funds were the proceeds of criminal activity. Mohammad knew at least one Herocoin client was engaged in illegal activity on the dark web,” the Justice Department said.Mohammad also processed cryptocurrency deposited into bitcoin ATMs, supplied the machines with cash for customers to withdraw, and maintained the server software that operated the machines.The Department of Justice said that Mohammad “intentionally failed to register his company with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)” even though he was aware of the registration requirement. He also “chose not to … develop and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, file currency transaction reports for exchanges of currency in excess of $10,000, conduct due diligence on customers, and file suspicious activity reports for transactions over $2,000 involving customers he knew, or had reason to suspect, were involved in criminal activity,” the DOJ detailed, adding:With respect to his bitcoin ATM network, Mohammad’s machines allowed customers to conduct financial transactions without requiring any identification and permitted customers to conduct multiple, consecutive transactions of up to $3,000 each without ever reporting suspicious activity to regulators or law enforcement.FinCEN contacted Mohammad in July 2018 and he subsequently registered with the regulator but “continued to fail to comply fully with federal law concerning money laundering, conducting due diligence and reporting suspicious customers,” according to the DOJ.Mohammad also conducted multiple in-person transactions with undercover agents, helping them exchange cash into bitcoin. The agents represented that they worked at a karaoke bar that employed women from Korea who entertained men in various ways, including engaging in sexual activity. “Mohammad never filed a currency transaction report or suspicious activity report for these transactions,” the DOJ said.Do you think this bitcoin ATM operator should go to jail for two years?

892,"Every Fourth Australian Willing to Be Paid in Bitcoin, Poll Finds","May 29, 2021","A new survey has established that one in four Australians would like to receive at least part of their salary in cryptocurrency. While the motives vary between the members of this diverse group, the results indicate that the Australian nation’s overall interest in decentralized digital money remains strong. The poll has been conducted among 1,000 Australian residents by the comparison website Finder. The company is actually among the first in the country to offer employees the option to take a portion of their remuneration in cryptocurrency. The platform has now found that 24% of Australians, or around 4.7 million, are ready to accept bitcoin (BTC) as part of their salaries.Of those who would be willing to be paid in BTC, Finder pointed out, 14% have said so because they are convinced it is going up in value, while another 10% admitted a bitcoin payment would help them to invest in digital currency before tax.Taylor Blackburn, personal finance specialist at Finder, notes that the cryptocurrency has seen impressive growth in the past year, “despite its recent drop and sometimes volatile nature.” Commenting on the outcome of the study, Blackburn further emphasized:With more Australians looking for inflation hedges, yield-bearing assets and alternative investment opportunities, it’s not surprising that this many people are willing to be paid part of their salary in Bitcoin.According to the survey, Generation X Australians are more likely than others to view a crypto salary as a wise investment. 22% of the respondents in this age group think BTC is going to appreciate even more over time, along with 19% of millennials. For comparison, only 1% of baby boomers and 13% of Generation Z share their optimism.The researchers also discovered that men with higher incomes ($100,000 and above) are more interested in Bitcoin in general. Furthermore, male respondents (21%) are far more likely to accept BTC payments than women (8%) because of their belief the cryptocurrency’s value will increase. 13% of men and 8% of female participants respectively think crypto wages will allow them to invest before taxation.Despite the positive trends registered in the study, over half of Australians (55%) are still not interested in crypto remuneration. Another 13% fear bitcoin’s volatility which lowers their trust in the cryptocurrency. Finder also notes that 8% of the polled Aussies have stated they need to access all the money they make each payday.Is your salary partially or fully paid in cryptocurrency?

893,Q1 SEC Filing Shows Argentinian Tech Giant Globant Invested in Bitcoin,"May 28, 2021","Globant, one of the big four tech firms in Argentina, has quietly made its first foray into the world of cryptocurrency investing, according to its latest filing to the SEC. The firm bought bitcoin during the first three months of this year, and is now part of a select number of LATAM unicorns that have taken the approach of putting some of its value in crypto assets.Globant, a software tech giant unicorn based in Argentina, has joined a select group of companies that are currently invested in cryptocurrencies, according to its latest filing to the SEC. The company, founded in 2003, reported the purchase of $500,000 in bitcoin (BTC) during the first quarter of 2021 (Q1). A small sum for a company with a valuation of more than $6.5 billion and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Globant listed the bitcoin company as part of its intangible assets, saying bitcoin is:A cryptocurrency that is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset because bitcoin lacks physical form and there is no limit to its useful life, bitcoin is not subject to amortization but it is tested for impairment.The filing states Globant purchased the aforementioned worth of bitcoin, but doesn’t specify the number of bitcoins that were purchased or the price the company paid for them. However, the filing does clarify that Globant will recognize impairment losses if the price of the assets falls behind the price of acquisition, and gains will not be recorded until the sale of the asset.While some USA-based companies like Microstrategy and Tesla, and asset managers like Grayscale have been quick to jump into the cryptocurrency bandwagon, its LATAM-based counterparts have had a more tepid approach to this new asset class. This might be related to how quickly these companies embrace innovation and how they manage the risk vs opportunity balance due to their own business models.However, Globant is not the first Argentinian company that has made inroads with cryptocurrency. Mercadolibre, an e-tailer company that has a big footprint in LATAM, bought $7.8 million in bitcoin this month, declaring it as part of their treasury strategy, potentially hinting at more bitcoin purchases down the road. Mercadolibre also launched a real estate platform that only accepts bitcoin as payment.More LATAM-based companies, and specifically Argentinian ones, are expected to embrace crypto as part of their business strategy soon, due to the devaluation of the national currency and the difficulties that they face in acquiring dollars.What do you think of Globant’s purchase of cryptocurrencies? Tell us in the comments section below.

894,Ark Invest CEO Says Impossible to Shut Down Bitcoin — Regulators Will Become More Friendly Over Time,"May 28, 2021","The CEO of Ark Investment Management (Ark Invest), Cathie Wood, says regulators cannot shut down bitcoin. She added that they will become more friendly towards cryptocurrencies over time. Wood is not the only one who thinks that governments cannot shut down bitcoin.Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood shared her view on bitcoin, its regulation, and environmental impact at the Consensus 2021 conference Thursday.The CEO said that bitcoin is “already on its way and it’ll be impossible to shut it down.” She added that regulators “will be a little more friendly over time” towards cryptocurrencies due to a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the innovation coming from the crypto sector.Wood also commented on bitcoin’s environmental impact, stating that “Half of the solution is understanding the problem.” She described: “This auditing of what miners, certainly in North America, are willing to do around how much of their electricity usage is generated by renewables is going to bring that topic into stark relief, and will encourage an acceleration in the adoption of renewables beyond which otherwise would have taken the place.”Early this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he met with North American bitcoin miners in a close-door meeting hosted by Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor. The miners have agreed to form a Bitcoin Mining Council to promote renewable energy usage in bitcoin mining.Wood is not the only one who believes that governments cannot shut down bitcoin. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said banning bitcoin is like shutting down the internet. “I don’t see how you could ban it … I think that it would be a foolish thing for the government to try to do that,” she opined, noting, “I think it’s very difficult to ban something that’s essentially a peer-to-peer technology.”Congressman Patrick McHenry said back in 2019 that bitcoin was “unstoppable,” adding: “We should not attempt to deter this innovation, and governments cannot stop this innovation and those that have tried have already failed.”Last week, the CEO of Ark Invest reaffirmed her bitcoin price prediction, stating that her firm still sees the price of BTC reaching $500K. She further emphasized that that “All of our indicators are saying this is capitulation right now.”Do you think regulators can shut down bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

895,Whistleblower Edward Snowden Says $6 Trillion in Stimulus Is 'Good for Bitcoin’,"May 28, 2021","The infamous whistleblower and privacy activist Edward Snowden commented on bitcoin on Friday, after the Biden administration said this week it was shooting for 6 trillion dollars in stimulus proposals. Following the $6 trillion in stimulus headlines, Snowden commented on the situation and said it was “good for bitcoin.”The 37-year old former computer intelligence consultant for the National Security Agency (NSA) and contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Edward Snowden, has once again commented on the leading digital asset bitcoin. Snowden’s statement on Twitter follows the last few days of reports discussing the Biden administration’s $6 trillion stimulus proposals to “build back a better” America. “Six trillion dollars? This is good for Bitcoin,” the whistleblower Edward Snowden said on Friday. The tweet already has 36,000 likes and has been retweeted more than 6,000 times. Of course, it’s not the first time Snowden has spoken about bitcoin, as the whistleblower and privacy activist has been very vocal about the subject in recent years. For instance, after the March 12, 2020 market carnage, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday,’ Snowden said: “This is the first time in a while I’ve felt like buying bitcoin. That drop was too much panic and too little reason.”Back when Snowden’s book sales were confiscated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), after the DoJ announced a lawsuit against the whistleblower, Snowden also tweeted: “In conclusion, this is good for bitcoin.” Snowden, however, hasn’t been looked at too kindly by the bitcoin maximalist crowd because he’s criticized the crypto asset on a few occasions. Snowden recently took to Twitter and knocked the Human Rights Foundation’s (HRF) Alex Gladstein’s recent statements. Gladstein wasn’t a fan of Snowden’s recent interview. “The worst part of cryptocurrency transforming into dragon-level wealth is witnessing good people emotionally devolve into dragons themselves: so intellectually paralyzed by the fear that everyone they see threatens their hoard that they lose sight of the world beyond their cave,” Snowden scathed in response to Gladstein’s Twitter statements.The whistleblower does criticize bitcoin on occasion, but also explains that he uses it regularly and once called the technology the “first free money” system in the world. He’s discussed privacy coins on various occasions like monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC). There is no doubt that Snowden is a believer in decentralized technologies and he’s mentioned many times that cryptos are a threat to the nation state’s monopoly over money.In 2016, Snowden once said that “new technologies raise the possibility of unstoppable tax protests.” Snowden has since deleted that tweet, but still talks positively about bitcoin and the crypto economy regularly to this day. What do you think about Edward Snowden’s comment about Biden’s $6 trillion stimulus proposals being good for bitcoin? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

896,BOJ's Kuroda Criticizes Bitcoin — Central Bank Governor Says Trading Is 'Barley Used for Settlement',"May 28, 2021","Following the recent developments in China and the environmental concerns about bitcoin’s energy consumption, the Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda criticized the leading crypto asset bitcoin in an interview on Thursday.Bitcoin prices have slumped again on Friday after a tumultuous week. After tapping a daily high on Thursday at $40,125 per unit, bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a low of $35,146 losing more than 12% in value. Since then, however, BTC has managed to regain some losses and climb back above the $36k handle.According to Bloomberg, some of the recent sell-off during the early Friday morning hours (ET), may have been due to comments stemming from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. The central bank’s lead criticized bitcoin and said that the crypto asset was not used much at all for settlement purposes. The criticism from Kuroda follows the recent statements from the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly that said they wanted to transform the bustling city into a cryptocurrency “trading center.” BoJ Governor Kuroda’s cryptocurrency outlook is entirely different it seems.“Most of the trading is speculative and volatility is extraordinarily high,” Kuroda said about bitcoin in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday. “It’s barely used as a means of settlement,” the central bank Governor added.Kuroda may be speaking out against bitcoin because of climate change discussions he’s been partaking in this week. Central bankers around the world are not only criticizing bitcoin, as many banking leaders are also addressing climate change concerns as well these days. The BoJ’s Kuroda said on Thursday that the central bank has a “great interest” in tackling these climate concerns.“Naturally, how we respond to this at the level of monetary policy will become a topic of discussion,” Kuroda emphasized on Thursday. Similar to the questions Jerome Powell has been getting about inflation, Kuroda was also asked about inflation this week. “That policy stance is based on the recognition that it will take time to overcome low inflation once it is entrenched,” Kuroda noted. The central bank governor further added:That is the lesson learned from Japan’s experience of prolonged deflation.Kuroda’s statements about bitcoin also follow the country’s gaming giant Nexon purchasing 1,717 BTC on April 28. Unlike the BoJ Governor’s statements, Nexon recently said: “bitcoin offers long-term stability and liquidity while maintaining the value of our cash for future investments.” Japanese regulators, on the other hand, have been following South Korea’s lead in preparing for Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines toward crypto-assets.While discussing the fear of inflation with the press on Thursday, the BoJ Governor stressed that stimulus would continue. Kuroda follows the same stability line of 2% inflation, as many other central banks reference, and noted that the BoJ’s stimulus must remain persistent.“Each central bank has to adapt its monetary policy to its own economic, price, and financial situations,” Kuroda concluded. “Our inflation rate is still quite low and so we have to be persistent in conducting our monetary easing to achieve our 2% price stability target.”What do you think about the BoJ’s Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his comments about bitcoin?

899,Veriblock Reveals Initiative to Recycle Bitcoin's Energy Consumption by Securing Dogecoin,"May 27, 2021","On Wednesday, the Veriblock project, a blockchain that leverages the implementation of proof-of-proof (PoP) consensus, announced an initiative to secure the Dogecoin blockchain using Bitcoin. The Veriblock Foundation believes the effort counters the hostile ‘Blood Bitcoin’ narrative in regard to recent environmental concerns over proof-of-work (PoW). The Veriblock Foundation, a nonprofit created to bolster the adoption of Veriblock’s PoP securitizing consensus algorithm, has revealed a new initiative dedicated to securing the Dogecoin network. Presently, Veriblock developers are in the midst of integrating PoP into the Dogecoin codebase and aim to “present an open-source beta to the Dogecoin community soon for testing and feedback.”Additionally, the Veriblock team will perform a 51% attack on the PoP-enabled version of Dogecoin in order to showcase the benefits of this technology. Veriblock’s cofounder and chief technical officer Maxwell Sanchez discussed the benefits of the organization’s PoP technology and how the BTC network’s PoW can be better utilized.“Bitcoin has been under public fire recently for the large carbon footprint of its Proof-of-Work mining protocol,” Sanchez said. “Veriblock reuses Bitcoin’s mining power to secure the world’s blockchains, amortizing the per-transaction environmental cost to levels far below what legacy financial systems provide while enabling Bitcoin to easily meet the requirements demanded by many Fortune 500 companies interested in blockchain technology,” Sanchez stressed.The Veriblock executive further added:As Bitcoin becomes better utilized through technologies like Proof-of-Proof, it has the potential to become the world’s most efficient and secure financial platform while providing solutions that transcend finance to fight police corruption, enforce digital property rights, and more. We hope that our work can help to realize Bitcoin’s potential as the security backbone for the digital ecosystem of tomorrow.Veriblock says that the PoP technology lets any blockchain inherit the powerful security offered by the BTC network’s hashpower. Sanchez believes that the integration of PoP will benefit both chains by securing Dogecoin and making Bitcoin more pleasing to environmentalists.“Dogecoin already utilizes a shared security model by merge-mining with Litecoin, making it a perfect candidate for Veriblock’s security inheritance technology,” Sanchez emphasized. “Merge-mining has several critical security issues and decoupling Dogecoin from Litecoin will significantly benefit the security profile of both projects while making Bitcoin eco-friendly,” the Veriblock executive explained.Veriblock’s project is nothing new to the crypto community, as people have been discussing PoP for quite some time. In December 2019, Veriblock was controversial for its use of block space and the usage made PoP the most used BTC-based OP_Return protocol that year.At the time Bitcoin (BTC) influencers called the Veriblock outputs “inefficient,” “abuse,” and “spam.” At the end of 2019, small block advocates grew very frustrated with the PoP outputs and even published blog posts about “Transaction Eugenics.” However, in 2020 and into 2021, controversial topics involving Veriblock’s use of the Bitcoin blockchain’s block space stopped.During Wednesday’s Dogecoin announcement, Veriblock said that even though some people are advocating for proof-of-stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus models, members of the Veriblock team argues that these “solutions are fundamentally opposed to the decentralized ethos that Bitcoin was founded upon.”“Without a Proof-of-Work component, PoS and PoC are fundamentally insecure and is more analogous to the traditional finance world where financial institutions can hold funds hostage and blackball transactions at whim,” Sanchez added.“These alternative security protocols don’t solve the same problems or provide the same benefits of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work, so comparing their ‘efficiency’ to Bitcoin is a non-starter. However, using a technology like Proof-of-Proof backstops these weakly-subjective security protocols with a Proof-of-Work component, making them viable,” the Veriblock executive concluded.What do you think about the Veriblock PoP idea and its plans to secure the Dogecoin network?

900,Executives from China's Largest Bitcoin Mining Firms Speak About Regulatory Crackdown,"May 27, 2021","During the course of the week, the cryptocurrency community has been focused on China and the country’s Financial Stability Board detailing that it aims to crack down on the bitcoin mining sector. Following the statements from Chinese officials and a few crypto businesses abandoning services in the region, executives from some of China’s largest bitcoin mining companies have openly discussed the situation.The million-dollar question right now is whether or not the Chinese government will continue to crack down on the crypto industry. It all started when Reuters published a report on May 18, that said: “China bans financial, payment institutions from cryptocurrency business.” Essentially the news publication said that “three financial industry associations” from China told financial institutions and payment processors “not to offer any crypto-related services.”Services include “account openings, registration, trading, clearing, settlement, and insurance, reiterating the 2017 ban,” Reuters further noted in a follow-up explainer the next day. Then five days ago, regional reports detailed China’s 51st meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, and the organization’s director, Liu He, discussed the bitcoin mining sector. Again, the Economic Affairs Commission and Financial Stability Board said it would crackdown on illegal bitcoin mining and monitor the sector.Following the economic affairs meeting and statements from Liu He, Btc.top’s CEO Jiang Zhuoer spoke about the situation. “According to the minutes of ‘China Financial Stability Board:’ We resolutely prevent and control financial risk…. we shall crack down Bitcoin mining and crypto trading activities in order to prevent individual risks from being spread to the social level,” Zhuoer said.“From there, we can see that the main spirit of the meeting is to ‘prevent and control financial risks,’ to restrain social capital from flowing into the crypto mining sector which might lead to risks transferring from individuals to the whole society,” Zhuoer continued. “In other words, individual mining is and has always been allowed as long as you’re responsible for your own risks and profits, whilst the mining operated by financial capital might be [forbidden].”Zhuoer also compared the minutes this year to what was said during the minutes’ definition declared back in 2013, which was repeated Zhuoer added. The Btc.top CEO spoke about September 4, 2017, that day the world watched China ban initial coin offerings (ICOs) and then the shut down of domestic crypto exchanges. As far as China’s bitcoin miners, Zhuoer says the guidelines may invoke some losses but it may not be as bad as most think.“Large [datacenters] and major veteran miners may suffer a significant loss this time, while the whole Bitcoin network will be as resilient as always,” Zhuoer stressed. “The worst scenario would be: large datacenters are shut down and we go back to old days in 2014-15. Small miners install several miners at home; Medium miners set dozens of miners in a warehouse or a few hundred miners in a factory; Veteran miners find a small remote hydroelectric power plant and locate there a couple thousand miners.”The Btc.top executive added:In conclusion, bitcoin mining will exist as normal, except the mining in China will be shifted from industrial-size datacenters to home miners, small or medium-sized miners. The entire Bitcoin network will always be strong even [if] its hashrate [declines] by 50%. In addition to Btc.top’s CEO, executives from a number of other Chinese mining firms and rig manufacturers spoke about the reported crackdowns. Reuters reported on May 26, that Chinese ASIC manufacturers “are now looking elsewhere for growth.” Alex Ao, vice president of Innosilicon Technology explained that “foreign miners will benefit.” “Places like North America and Central Asia have advantages in terms of power supply and policy support,” Ao detailed.In another statement, Hangzhou-based Ebang International remarked that “domestic customers will go overseas to mine.” “Mining machines will still be in short supply,” the Ebang spokesperson added. Edward Lu, senior vice president of Canaan Inc, added his opinion about the situation in China. “The strategy should be to strenuously develop markets such as Kazakhstan, Canada, and North Europe, where energy resources are abundant and cheap, while regulations are clear and predictable,” Lu said.Meanwhile, the Shenzhen-based firm Bit Mining announced plans this week that it will construct a 100 MW bitcoin mining data center in Kazakhstan. Formerly known as 500.com, Bit Mining owns Btc.com and the mining rig manufacturer Bee Computing. Similar to Bit Mining both Btc.com and Bee Computing are based in China and may face harsher regulations.The Sichuan Energy Regulatory Office also revealed this week that it will gather on June 2 to discuss bitcoin mining. The meeting is required by China’s National Energy Administration, according to a regional report.What do you think about the comments from Chinese mining rig manufacturers and mining farm operators?

901,GamerHash (GHX) Token Is Now Listed on Bitcoin.com Exchange,"May 27, 2021","PRESS RELEASE. Bitcoin.com Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of GHX, being available to trade on the 27th May 2021 at 10:00AM UTC. GHX (GamerCoin) was created by the GamerHash team, as an incentive for the miners within the app and as a reward for carrying out the tasks on the Play&Earn module. GHX will start trading with BTC as a pair.What is GamerHash? GamerHash is an ecosystem where gamers can use their computing power to earn Bitcoin. That is the basic functionality of the platform, created in 2017, that has brought together over half a million gamers to this day. One of the moot points behind the recent GHX token growth is the already working platform supporting over 600,000 registered users. The big number of users (mostly gamers) corresponds with the ease of crypto mining on the platform – you can earn BTC while playing games or watching Netflix. At the same time, you receive GamerCoin as a 20% bonus on top of the BTC you mine. Lower-end PC owners with computers not suitable for mining can join Play&Earn where they can still enjoy crypto rewards when completing simple tasks such as playing games or registering on a GamerHash partners platform. In a nutshell, GamerHash is a self-financing supercomputer – built in a decentralized manner with the help of gamers.Most recently, GamerHash partnered with Exeedme and became a Silver Partner to Blockchain Game Alliance – one of the most influential Crypto & Gaming associations, where among its members, there is; Sandbox, Enjin, ANRKeyX, Simplex and other top NFT projects. This all boils down to a significant preparation period for future partnerships on top of ones that GamerHash already has with Chainlink and æternity.The platform is already successful, by means of its abundance of users, but the company CMO Artur Pszczółkowski wants to go deeper and become an “Amazon of NFTs” – the team would like to convince its users to partially spend what they’ve ‘mined’ to purchase their first NFTs. More importantly, the cooperation between Chainlink and GamerHash seems to give new possibilities such as utilizing match outcomes to mint rare NFTs, which can then trade on the GamerHash Marketplace. As previously mentioned, GamerHash would like to allow gamers to trade in the P2P way of their gaming NFTs in a safe environment.What is GamerCoin (GHX)?According to Wikipedia, Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). Therefore, the high price rise of GamerCoin is not a surprise (with over 600,000 users). The native $GHX ERC-20 token is used as an incentive for the miners within the app, and a reward for carrying out the tasks on the Play&Earn module. Future use cases will consist of getting access to special events within the ecosystem, as well as creating a P2P NFTs marketplace as part of expanding the GamerHash Store (~600 products).Another strong point about GamerHash and its GHX token is legal compliance. The team managed to have the GamerCoin whitepaper registered by the Maltese financial authorities (MFSA). It’s the first project in the European Union to launch a token within this new regulatory framework of Malta’s MFSA.Strong EndorsementDanish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com Exchange, shared his views on GamerHash, and their respective token GHX: “From the beginning of the crypto industry, the gaming community has always been an integral part of the mining process, and the team at GamerHash have found a great way to target this group of individuals, and incentivise them for their hardware, and for their hobby, or work in some cases.”
Chaudhry continues on by saying; “We’re very excited to see how GamerHash will continue to empower their vision for the future of wide-scale mining via gamers, and gain further outreach with our outstanding community at the exchange.”Artur Pszczolkowski, CMO of GamerHash expressed his enthusiasm towards the listing, stating that: “The Bitcoin.com Exchange is an important and well-respected part of the crypto ecosystem around the world. It is a great opportunity for the GH community to expand their trading area. We are delighted to be working hand in hand with such a good project. I hope it’s just the beginning of greater cooperation between us in the future”. About Bitcoin.com ExchangeThe mission of Bitcoin.com Exchange is to empower people from all over the world to trade cryptocurrencies with ease and confidence, from first-time traders to advanced trading professionals.

Users exchange their idle computing power and complete Play&Earn tasks to earn Bitcoin. It can be withdrawn or exchanged for +600 digital products in the GamerHash Store. GamerCoin $GHX token is listed on top cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bithumb and KuCoin. At the same, it’s the first (EU) licensed gaming token.

902,Guggenheim CIO Scott Minerd Predicts More Bitcoin Sell-Off but Remains Bullish Long Term,"May 26, 2021","The chief investment officer of Guggenheim, Scott Minerd, has predicted more sell-off for bitcoin. He also warned that it will take a while for the cryptocurrency to return to its previous highs. However, in the long term, Minerd has predicted that bitcoin’s price could rise to $600K.The chief investment officer (CIO) of Guggenheim Partners, Scott Minerd, has made another bearish prediction for bitcoin’s price in the short term. Minerd is also the chairman of Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners. Guggenheim Investments has about $270 billion in total assets under management across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies.He told CNBC on Tuesday that bitcoin has not hit its bottom just yet, emphasizing:You can afford to be patient here. There’s more to go.He explained that bitcoin had gone “exponential” and it will take some time for the cryptocurrency to return to its previous highs. He believes that an obstacle to bitcoin will be that some investors are now moving capital away from BTC into competing cryptocurrencies.Furthermore, “Any market that goes exponential is automatically unsustainable. I just looked at it and realized that given the size of the move, which was essentially a mania or a bubble, that traditionally you get 50% to 75%, declines coming out of the top of the bubble,” the CIO opined.Minerd has been predicting a decline in the price of bitcoin for months. In April, he warned of a major correction in the cryptocurrency that could send its price down 50% to the $20K-$30K level. He said the BTC price at the time looked “very frothy.” Soon after his prediction, bitcoin’s price fell to the $30K level.In the long term, however, the CIO has predicted that the price of bitcoin could reach $600K. “If you consider the supply of bitcoin relative, let’s say, to the supply of gold in the world … You’ll be talking about $400K to $600K per bitcoin,” he said in February. “That’s an indication of what might be a fair value. That gives you a lot of room to run.” He ultimately sees bitcoin and ether as “winners” in the cryptocurrency market.What do you think about Guggenheim CIO Scott Minerd’s bitcoin prediction? Let us know in the comments section below.

903,"Beijing's Distaste for Bitcoin Mining Spreads to Inner Mongolia, Miners Could Face a 'Social Credit Blacklist'","May 26, 2021","Beijing’s recent crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry has found its way into Inner Mongolia according to a recent report. Inner Mongolian officials plan to introduce harsh penalties to bitcoin mining operations using the region’s grid without permission from authorities. A regional report published by South China Morning Post’s contributor Coco Feng explains that Inner Mongolia’s top economic planner has revealed new rules against operating bitcoin mining facilities in the region.The new draft rules are available for public review until June 1 and it recently follows Inner Mongolian authorities asking residents to report illegal bitcoin data centers to the government. Beijing wants mainland China and even the Mongolic autonomous region of the People’s Republic of China to be carbon neutral by 2060.Feng details that the authorities in Inner Mongolia plan to target “industrial parks, data centres, telecoms companies, internet firms, and even cybercafes.” Bitcoin.com News recently reported on how cybercafes in China have been mining cryptocurrencies for extra income.The news rules aim to “punish bitcoin miners or those providing resources to miners” by leveraging a number of enforcements. Transgressors could be added to China’s “social credit blacklist” which would stop them from obtaining finance loans in the country and other benefits.Other punishments include:Revoking business licenses, and even shutting their businesses down completely. Wang Juan, an associate professor on blockchain at Xi’an Jiaotong University detailed that the crypto market is slowly moving away from mainland China.“We are seeing the cryptocurrency market follow a path to ‘de-China-isation’ – first on trading and now on computing power, based on a series of stronger steps taken against cryptocurrencies and bitcoin mining last week by Beijing,” Juan explained on Tuesday.Moreover, cryptocurrency firms have been abandoning China during the last few days. Huobi and Okex stopped offering specific services to mainland customers and Btc.top and Hashcow followed suit the next day. Some have even implied that Chinese miners will be selling “cheap” mining rigs in the near future.What do you think about Inner Mongolia following Beijing’s recent crackdown on the crypto industry and bitcoin mining?

904,"Analyst Expects Bitcoin to 'Grind Down' to $15K, With a 'Periodic Dead Cat Bounce' Along the Way","May 26, 2021","An analyst from the biotech consulting group Biotechvalley Insights believes after bitcoin lost 53% from the crypto asset’s all-time high, “the party is clearly over.” The biotech consulting group analyst thinks crypto investors will witness a slow “grind down the slope of hope with a periodic dead cat bounce” and expects prices to drop to $15,000 in the next few weeks.**Editor’s note: This article was updated at 4:55 p.m. (EST) to reflect a comment from a Bitcoin.com News reader who commented on the Biotechvalley Insights’ analyst’s editorial hosted on Seeking Alpha, and said the comment was deleted. According to an analyst from Biotechvalley Insights, crypto investors should sell bitcoin and “do not look back.” The analyst said that he had warned investors in a previous article, before bitcoin (BTC) collapsed from a high of $64,895 to $30,066 losing more than 50% in value. The biotech consulting group investor stresses that people “should consider liquidating anything related to bitcoin or short it.”“[The] recent collapse proves that Bitcoin isn’t a safe haven, store of value, or a hedge against inflation/market correction, but a speculative token that can go down 50% in a week,” the article published on Tuesday notes. “Bitcoin has exhausted its exotic catalysts and is under coordinated regulatory attack by governments around the world. At this point, I don’t think there is anything that can save it from collapsing more,” the analyst’s report adds.The biotech author is a financial blogger ranked 7,211 out of 8,041 bloggers, and a -18.3% average return per rating. Nevertheless, the Biotechvalley Insights’ researcher is not the only individual who believes that “bitcoin is dead.” Two days ago, the gold bug Peter Schiff tweeted about ethereum and bitcoin with distaste.“Ethereum took out its May 19th low of $1,850. Bitcoin is less than $2K away from taking out it’s May 19th low too. On May 10th the total market capitalization of 10,000 crypto currencies hit a high of $2.485 trillion. It took less than two weeks to fall below $1.3 trillion,” Schiff said.The Biotechvalley Insights’ analyst believes that bitcoin’s downward spiral will take longer than most expect. The analyst’s target price is $15,000–$16,000 per BTC, but further says “the million-dollar question at this point would be, are we out of the woods?” The biotech consulting group researcher’s article emphasizes:I believe Bitcoin has a long way to fall from here. I think it will slowly grind down the slope of hope with a periodic dead cat bounce. As the technology is severely damaged, it is better to be the first one to sell into the bubble before the whole ship sinks.Bitcoin (BTC) and a myriad of other cryptocurrencies have been facing fierce scrutiny over environmental concerns, and governments are cracking down with excessive regulations. The biotech analyst says those are definitely issues, but cryptocurrencies also “have an extreme level of leverage.”“Any unexpected price movement downward can lead to rapid liquidations as many investors can’t meet the margin requirement,” the report notes. “Adding to that, it is no secret that bitcoin whales profit from this excessive leverage by manipulating the market and causing unexpected volatility to liquidate retail investors’ positions.”The analyst’s game plan is to short bitcoin (BTC) “until US$31k and liquidate 30-50% of the position to cover the cost base and continuously short with the house’s money.” The researcher thinks there will be key resistance in this range but after it breaks down resistance around “$19-20k” is expected.** After this article was published, an email was sent to Bitcoin.com News in regard to the analyst’s editorial from Biotechvalley Insights. The individual added a comment to his analysis article hosted on Seeking Alpha, and the biotech analyst allegedly deleted it.What do you think about the Biotechvalley Insights analyst and the target of $15,000–$16,000 per bitcoin?

905,UK Bans 'Time to Buy' Bitcoin Ads on Buses and Underground for Being Misleading,"May 26, 2021","The British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a bitcoin ad campaign put up across the London Underground network and on London buses by cryptocurrency exchange Luno. The UK advertising regulator says the ads are misleading and irresponsible.A bitcoin advertising campaign put up across London Underground and on buses has been banned by the U.K. Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ads contained an image of a bitcoin with the words “If you’re seeing bitcoin on a bus, it’s time to buy” or “If you’re seeing bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy.” They were put up in February.The ASA said it received four complaints. Three complainants “believed the ad failed to illustrate the risk of the investment” and “challenged whether it was misleading.” One complainant “challenged whether the ad took advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity,” the regulator detailed.“We considered that consumers would interpret the statement ‘If you’re seeing bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy’ as a reference to buying bitcoin as an investment,” the ASA affirmed, elaborating:The ad appeared across the London Underground and London buses networks, which were untargeted media, and was therefore likely to have been seen by consumers who did not have extensive financial knowledge and experience of bitcoin, and would expect that the exchange of bitcoin would be regulated, with legal protection in place for investment activities.“We understood that neither Luno nor the bitcoin market in general was regulated within the UK, and therefore consumers could not seek recourse to services such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service,” the ASA noted, adding:We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading.The agency further said: “We considered that consumers would interpret the statement ‘it’s time to buy’ as a call to action and that the simplicity of the statement gave the impression that bitcoin investment was straightforward and accessible.”However, the advertising regulator stated that “Bitcoin investment was complex, volatile, and could expose investors to losses and considered that stood in contrast to the impression given by the ad, that investment was simple and conventional.” The agency then detailed:We concluded that the ad irresponsibly suggested that engaging in bitcoin investment through Luno was straightforward and easy, particularly given that the audience it addressed, the general public, were likely to be inexperienced in their understanding of cryptocurrencies, and was therefore in breach of the Code.Luno Money Ltd., which put up the ads, told the ASA that “the ads would not appear again in the form complained about,” adding that “their future ads would feature an appropriate risk warning.”What do you think about the ASA’s reasons for banning these bitcoin ads?

906,Chinese Firm Bit Mining Invests $9M to Build 100 Megawatt Bitcoin Farm in Kazakhstan,"May 26, 2021","Shenzhen-based Bit Mining is planning to construct and operate a 100 MW crypto-mining data center in Kazakhstan. The project will be implemented in partnership with two local companies that will also provide the enterprise with an array of services. The total amount of the investment will exceed $9 million. Bit Mining announced this week it has entered into a binding investment term sheet with a Kazakhstani entity. The two companies will cooperate on the construction of a new crypto mining facility in the Central Asian republic. The Chinese firm will have an 80% equity interest in the new Kazakhstan Mining Data Center, with the remaining 20% held by its local partner.The bitcoin farm will launch with a power capacity of 20 MW and when fully operational it’s expected to reach a total capacity of 100 MW. Bit Mining said it’s going to invest 60 million Chinese yuan (around $9.33 million) into the joint project.The Chinese company has also concluded two service agreements for its mining equipment, one of which with its main partner and a second one with another company from Kazakhstan. They will provide a range of needed services including on-site device hosting, broadband network support, security monitoring, server management, and maintenance. The agreements will come into force on July 1, 2021.Formerly known as 500.com, Bit Mining has embarked on a rapid expansion in the crypto mining industry since earlier this year and its activities now cover cryptocurrency mining, mining pool and data center operations. Bit Mining has so far deployed bitcoin mining devices with a maximum hash rate capacity of approximately 1,031.5 PH/s. It owns three hydroelectric data centers with a total power capacity of 435 MW.In April, before its rebranding, the Chinese firm acquired the mining company Btc.com. It currently owns the entire mining pool business operated under Btc.com, including the domain name and the platform’s cryptocurrency wallet.The publicly-listed Bit Mining Limited (NYSE: BTCM) also bought Bee Computing (HK) Limited, a 7-nanometer cryptocurrency mining machine manufacturer. The acquisition aims to complete the vertical integration with its supply chain, the company noted, while increasing its self-sufficiency and strengthening its competitive position.This month, Bit Mining announced a project to establish a new cryptocurrency mining data center in the U.S. state of Texas. The investment worth $25 million is part of a binding agreement with Dory Creek, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bitdeer. The companies are planning to build and operate a 57 MW mining facility which will be powered using predominantly low-carbon energy.What do you think about Bit Mining’s latest project in Kazakhstan?

907,Shark Tank’s Kevin O'Leary Expects Flood of Institutional Money Into Bitcoin When ESG Standards Are Met,"May 25, 2021","Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, has predicted that a flood of institutional money will flow into bitcoin once miners have addressed the renewable energy and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. He said the flood will begin when bitcoin meets the ESG standards which will allow institutional investors to get into the asset class.Kevin O’Leary has reiterated his concerns about bitcoin’s sustainability and the importance of the cryptocurrency meeting institutions’ ESG standards during a webcast at the Consensus 2021 convention Monday. ESG refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business: environmental, social, and corporate governance.The Shark Tank star emphasized that institutional investors are still interested in bitcoin despite the recent sell-off. Currently, less than 1% of institutions globally invest in cryptocurrency as an asset class. He explained that one reason stopping them from getting into cryptocurrency at a faster pace is because they have sustainability committees that screen investments and only allow ones that meet ESG standards.On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that Musk talked to major North American bitcoin miners and they have agreed to form the “Bitcoin Mining Council” to promote renewable energy usage. However, many crypto proponents are skeptical.Nonetheless, O’Leary said that for the crypto industry:The fact that they’re going through this process, I consider a very positive sign.Mr. Wonderful revealed that the first question he asks a mining project before investing in it is how the project deals with ESG. Now that institutional investors are interested in gaining BTC exposure, he stressed that miners must ensure that bitcoin can meet the firms’ ESG standards.He previously said that large institutions have ESG compliance committees. “We have covenants around how assets are made, whether carbon is burned, whether human rights are involved, whether it’s made in China,” he explained. “Institutions will not buy coin mined in China, coin mined using coal to burn for electricity, coin mined in countries with sanctions on them.”The Shark Tank investor even suggested that there should be a way to “tag” a bitcoin and prove that it came from a sustainable energy source. While bitcoin proponents and developers are strongly opposed to any such data being tied to individual amounts, O’Leary claims that the technology is “being worked on,” and when it’s available, a flood of institutional money will come into bitcoin. He elaborated:It will be the reason it [bitcoin] goes to $100,000, $200,000. That’s not going to happen until institutions start to buy it. So everybody’s got to wake up and realize there’s demand, but it has to be done around ESG concerns.Do you agree with Kevin O’Leary? Let us know in the comments section below.

908,Goldman Sachs Says FOMO Is Driving Institutional Investors to Bitcoin,"May 25, 2021","Investment bank Goldman Sachs says institutional investors and asset managers are driven to bitcoin by “fear of missing out” (FOMO). Goldman now considers bitcoin a new asset class. Nonetheless, institutional investors are facing several strong barriers to entry into the crypto market.Goldman Sachs said Monday that the fear of missing out (FOMO) on potential gains from cryptocurrencies among investors has pushed crypto prices higher over the past year. Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs’ global head of digital assets, said in a note to clients:There’s no doubt that ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) is playing a role given how much bitcoin and other crypto assets have appreciated and how many interested parties of all flavors have jumped into this space.While liquidity has increased in the crypto market recently, the analyst said “it’s still difficult for institutions to gain access to the market, which remains quite fragmented.”He continued:If you’re an asset manager or running a macro fund and your closest rivals are all investing [in cryptocurrency] and seeing material returns, your investors will naturally wonder why you are not investing [in the asset class].McDermott proceeded to share key issues that Goldman clients have raised regarding what’s preventing them from increasing exposure to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.Firstly, McDermott said that “For corporates, increased involvement often depends on whether their board feels such involvement makes sense given the nature of the company and its objectives.” The Goldman analyst pointed out that “Some investment funds and asset managers don’t have the authority to invest a portion of their portfolios in crypto.”The second barrier concerns “How easily can clients gain exposure to the market, is the liquidity sufficient to meet their needs, and are they comfortable enough with the custody and security aspects of managing these assets?”In addition, some clients question whether having exposure to cryptocurrencies is the right thing to do and whether it makes sense for their investment strategies, portfolios, or balance sheets, the analyst detailed. Nonetheless, he emphasized:As evidenced by the increased inflows, more and more entities are becoming comfortable with having some exposure to the crypto space.What do you think about Goldman Sachs’ analysis?

909,Data Shows Bitcoin Addresses in Accumulation Captures Fresh New Highs,"May 25, 2021","After bitcoin prices dipped to a low of $30,066 per unit last week, lots of people have been focused on the panic sellers. Meanwhile, when bitcoin prices plunged, the number of bitcoin addresses in accumulation tapped an all-time high at 545,115 addresses.Bitcoin (BTC) prices slid from a $64,895 per unit high to a low of $30,066 per bitcoin in 30 days losing more than 53% in value. When the price plunge took place data from Glassnode’s bitcoin “accumulation addresses” spiked.The number of bitcoin addresses in accumulation shows fundamental strength signals and gives investors a perspective of long-term holders. Glassnode’s data reflects addresses with little to no incoming transactions, as opposed to addresses that are more active.Nine months ago, Glassnode reported on accumulation addresses reaching the 500k mark. “There are over 500,000 Bitcoin ‘accumulation addresses’ holding a total of 2.6 million BTC (~14%). Accumulation addresses: – have 2+ incoming txs – never spent BTC – were active in the past 7 years (accounting for lost coins) – exchanges & miners are excluded,” the analytics firm said at the time.The current number of bitcoin addresses in accumulation recorded on Monday, May 24, 2021, was approximately 545,115 addresses, according to Glassnode stats.Glassnode’s “The Week On-Chain” highlights “anecdotal indicators” from Bixen’s Mustafa Yilham recent tweet storm that alluded to miner sell pressure stemming from China.“Observing the spending of miner coins demonstrates that whilst there is an uptick in miner-to-exchange flows,” Glassnode’s report notes. “Up from 100 BTC/day to 300BTC/day, this still represents a relatively small portion of the ~900BTC/day issuance,” the researchers said.More than 16,000 addresses have been added to the sum of bitcoin addresses in accumulation since the first week of May. Following the dip to $30,066, bitcoin addresses in accumulation jumped higher.What do you think about the number of bitcoin addresses in accumulation stats?

910,Fund Manager One River Files SEC Prospectus for Carbon Neutral Bitcoin ETF,"May 25, 2021","On Monday, the crypto asset fund manager One River filed a unique bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the Form S-1 filed, One River wants to list a carbon-neutral bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Carbon-neutral bitcoin mining has been a topical conversation these days within the cryptocurrency community. One River is taking bitcoin funds to a different level by registering for a carbon-neutral bitcoin ETF with its partner the carbon credit platform MOSS. The CEO of MOSS Luis Felipe Adaime detailed in April that the “MOSS Carbon Neutral Custody allows any institutional or corporate investor a means to offset the carbon emissions associated with crypto assets.”On May 24, 2021, One River filed a Form S-1 registration with the SEC in order to disclose the company’s prospectus summary of the “One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust.” Common shares are to be listed on NYSE if the SEC approves the ETF, and performance will be measured with the MVIS One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Index. The ETF will leverage the spot price of carbon credits to offset calculations tethered to bitcoin energy consumption.“The Index is constructed using bitcoin price feeds from eligible bitcoin spot markets and volume-weighted median price average (“VWMP”), calculated over 20 intervals in rolling three-minute increments with adjustments to reflect the current spot price of carbon credits necessary to offset the estimated carbon footprint attributable to each bitcoin,” One River’s ETF filing notes. “The Index is designed to reflect the performance of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on a carbon-neutral basis,” the filing adds.The trust will hold bitcoin and offer direct exposure to the leading crypto assets in USD but on a “carbon neutral basis.” Essentially, the trust offered by One River “provides direct exposure to bitcoin, and the Shares of the Trust are valued on a daily basis using the same methodology used to calculate the Index, as adjusted to reflect the expenses associated with the offsetting carbon credits.”One River’s Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust filing with the SEC, follows the topical conversation being discussed during the past two weeks ever since Tesla stopped accepting bitcoin (BTC) for payments. More recently, Musk has been talking about working with North American bitcoin miners with the creation of a Bitcoin Mining Council. The focus on the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption has not left the limelight since, and One River’s filing comes at an interesting time.What do you think about One River’s Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust filing on Monday?

911,Crypto Proponents Become Skeptical of Closed-Door Meeting Between Billionaires and Bitcoin Miners,"May 25, 2021","After Tesla’s Elon Musk and Microstrategy CEO Micheal Saylor revealed the revelation of a newly created “Bitcoin Mining Council,” the news became a viral subject. While some crypto supporters like the idea, others have been skeptical of a couple of billionaires having closed-door meetings with North American bitcoin miners. On Monday, Elon Musk told his Twitter followers that he recently spoke with North American bitcoin miners, as he said they are “committed” to working toward using renewable energy sources.Following Musk’s statement, Microstrategy’s CEO Micheal Saylor said he hosted the meeting between Musk and the “leading bitcoin miners in North America.” Saylor further revealed some of the mining participants that have joined the “Bitcoin Mining Council.”According to Saylor’s tweet, miners such as Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, Galaxy Digital, Hive Blockchain, Hut8, Marathon, Argo Blockchain, and Blockcap have joined the initiative. Despite some people’s optimistic opinions about the Bitcoin Mining Council, not everyone was positive about this announcement.For a great number of crypto proponents, the closed-door meeting was looked at as shady and reminded them of the infamous Hong Kong and the New York Agreements. For instance, the Twitter account @altcoindailyio responded to Saylor’s tweet and said:We’ll call it the New York Agreement.The Twitter account @documentingbtc also responded to Saylor’s announcement and said:Closed-door meetings do not typically have any good outcomes in Bitcoin’s history.The Hong Kong and New York Agreements are very controversial times within the community. The Hong Kong Agreement took place on February 21, 2016, and was titled “Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus.” In that specific agreement, it said that the signatories agreed that the Bitcoin protocol would increase the block size to “2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB.”Many people signed the Hong Kong Agreement, including people who changed their positions later, and then decided to fight against any block size increase. Signatures from individuals, who in more recent times have been wholeheartedly against any block size increases, including people like Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, Peter Todd, Adam Back, and Samson Mow.Alongside a number of programmers, a large demographic of bitcoin miners also agreed to the Hong Kong Agreement’s commitments. But the Hong Kong Agreement never came to fruition, and soon led to another notorious meeting called the New York Agreement.The New York Agreement was initiated by the company Digital Currency Group and also became a controversial meeting. This meeting was dubbed “Bitcoin Scaling Agreement at Consensus 2017” after it was held during Coindesk’s Consensus conference in New York that year.Once again, a 2 MB block size increase was proposed and agreed upon by a great number of industry participants from 58 companies located in 22 countries, and 83.28% of hashing power. The only part of the New York Agreement that made it through was the implementation of Segregated Witness (Segwit), and the 2 MB increase was squashed.These prior meetings with miners have caused a lot of controversy within the cryptocurrency community, so Saylor’s and Musk’s Bitcoin Mining Council has been looked upon with the same skepticism.Some of the bitcoiners on the Reddit forum, r/bitcoin, don’t seem to appreciate the two billionaires interfering with miners and addressing carbon neutrality. One Reddit post calls the Bitcoin Mining Council a “publicity stunt to address environmental concerns.” In another post, one Redditor said:’Dirty energy Bitcoin’ is just Wall Street’s new way to slow bitcoin’s dominance since ‘only criminals use bitcoin’ stopped working.The conspiracy theories on r/bitcoin are littered all over the first few pages of the forum. One r/bitcoin post predicts that Tesla will soon announce a so-called Tesla Bitcoin mining operation and many people agreed with the theory.Despite the conspiracies, members of the Bitcoin Mining Council look forward to promoting the concept of environmentally friendly bitcoin mining operations. Executives from Argo Blockchain (LSE: ARB) said the firm discussed the situation with Musk and Saylor. Following the meeting, Peter Wall, Chief Executive of Argo Blockchain, said: “Today is a good day for the planet.”“Sustainability has always been at the heart of Argo’s mining operations and the newly-formed Bitcoin Mining Council is the next logical step in fostering a sectoral shift towards renewable energy,” Wall said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “I enjoyed speaking with Elon Musk about these issues this weekend, and look forward to joining Michael Saylor and other leading North American miners in working to future-proof an industry that must collectively improve sustainable mining practices and take ESG concerns seriously.”What do you think about the responses to Bitcoin Mining Council and the similarities between the meeting and the New York and Hong Kong Agreements?

913,Nobel Prize-Winning Economist Robert Shiller Mulls Over Getting Active in the Bitcoin Market,"May 24, 2021","Nobel laureate and professor at Yale University, Robert Shiller, is tempted by the crypto market. He is mulling over investing in cryptocurrency to experience the market. “I never bought bitcoin. Maybe I should be active in that market,” he said.Nobel laureate Robert Shiller talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with CNBC, published Sunday. Shiller won The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2013 alongside Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen “for their empirical analysis of asset prices,” The Nobel Prize’s website details. He is currently Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University.Shiller is concerned about the current housing market, stocks, and cryptocurrencies, stating that he sees a “wild west” mentality among investors in these markets.Discussing the crypto market in particular, Shiller said “That’s a very psychological market. It’s impressive technology.” However, he argued that “the ultimate source of value is so ambiguous that it has a lot to do with our narratives rather than reality.”Nonetheless, he said he has been tempted to get into crypto. The Nobel Prize-winning economist shared:I was thinking of buying them to experience the effect. A lot of people do that actually. I never bought bitcoin. Maybe I should be active in that market.Shiller has always been a bitcoin skeptic. In 2017, he said that the best example of “irrational exuberance or speculative bubbles” was bitcoin. In 2018, he said that it looks like a bubble and questioned whether the cryptocurrency will be around in 100 years. Nonetheless, he noted, “I don’t mean to be dismissive of bitcoin,” adding that something good may come out of cryptocurrency.Meanwhile, another Nobel laureate Paul Krugman said last week that he has given up predicting the imminent demise of bitcoin, stating that “There always seem to be a new crop of believers. Maybe just think of it as a cult that can survive indefinitely.”Do you think Nobel laureate Robert Shiller should buy bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

914,Ray Dalio Buys Bitcoin Despite Saying Governments May Ban Cryptocurrencies,"May 24, 2021","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has revealed that he owns bitcoin despite concerns he has long voiced about governments interfering and even outlawing cryptocurrencies. The boss of the world’s largest hedge fund said “bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success.”Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has revealed that he owns bitcoin. In an interview at the Consensus 2021 conference, which was recorded on May 6 but released Monday, he said:I have some bitcoin.Dalio is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, whose clients include endowments, governments, foundations, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds.Emphasizing that bitcoin is still small and not a threat to governments, he noted that if it succeeds, “one of the great things, I think, as a worry is the government having the capacity to control … bitcoin, or digital currencies. They know where they are, and they know what’s going on.”He continued: “The more we create savings in [bitcoin], the more you might say, ‘I’d rather have bitcoin than the bond’ … And then the more that happens, then it goes into bitcoin and it doesn’t go into credit, then [governments] lose control of that.” Dalio also said, “Personally, I’d rather have bitcoin than a bond.”As for the greatest risk he sees bitcoin facing, the Bridgewater Associates boss said:I think bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success.Dalio has come a long way on bitcoin and cryptocurrency. In November last year, he admitted that he may be wrong about bitcoin and wanted to learn more about the cryptocurrency. By December, he had learned enough to say that he saw BTC as a gold alternative. In January, he said bitcoin was “one hell of an invention.”However, throughout it all, he warned that the government could restrict bitcoin investments, such as by imposing “shocking” taxes. He believes that there is a “good probability” that governments will outlaw bitcoin and that bitcoin’s success would bring about tough regulation.What do you think about Ray Dalio buying bitcoin while warning about a government ban?

916,"Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Is Now Considered an Investable Asset, Clients Are Treating BTC as New Asset Class","May 24, 2021","Global investment bank Goldman Sachs now considers bitcoin an investable asset. “Clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable — it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class,” said Goldman Sachs’ analyst.Goldman Sachs published a research note on cryptocurrency this week stating that bitcoin has become an investable asset, a reverse of its earlier stance. Mathew McDermott, the bank’s global head of digital assets, wrote:Bitcoin is now considered an investable asset. It has its own idiosyncratic risk, partly because it’s still relatively new and going through an adoption phase.“And it doesn’t behave as one would intuitively expect relative to other assets given the analogy to digital gold; to date, it’s tended to be more aligned with risk-on assets,” he continued, elaborating:Clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable — it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class.In February, when Coinbase filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a direct listing on Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs said that bitcoin was not yet an investable asset class.The firm also initiated its coverage of the Coinbase stock (NASDAQ: COIN) on Monday with a buy rating and a price target of $306. Coinbase is currently trading at $227.88.The Goldman Sachs analyst also acknowledges in the research note that regulation of the crypto space poses a significant risk to further price appreciation. Nonetheless, McDermott said institutional clients remain keen on adding crypto exposure to their portfolios.He further noted that now “discussions with institutional clients revolve around how they can learn more on the topic and get access to the space.” In contrast, a few years ago, institutions were asking about what bitcoin or cryptocurrencies were.Goldman Sachs has been bullish about bitcoin lately. The bank formally established a cryptocurrency trading team earlier this month and said that institutional demand for crypto “continues to grow significantly.”What do you think about Goldman Sachs’ view of bitcoin now? Let us know in the comments section below.

917,Bitcoin Mining Operations Btc.top and Hashcow Cease Offering Services in China,"May 24, 2021","Following some stern warnings from a few major trade associations and regulators in China, two prominent exchanges, Huobi and Okex, have stopped offering services to Chinese residents. After the two exchanges halted specific services to residents of mainland China, two bitcoin mining operations have also abandoned the country on Monday. Btc.top and Hashcow have suspended services over “regulatory risks.”Two mining operations have revealed specific services have been suspended for residents living in mainland China. The news follows the recent announcement from Huobi and Okex when the firms announced this weekend that specific services would be halted for Chinese citizens. There’s been a flurry of government announcements stemming from China and the first warning was published on May 19.A Reuters report claimed at the time that “China has banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.” However, the report was quickly dismissed as fear, doubt, and uncertainty (FUD) by the greater crypto community. A few days later, more reports of Chinese officials discussing monitoring bitcoin mining were published by a variety of publications.Then this weekend, the two exchanges Huobi and Okex ceased offering services to customers in mainland China. Huobi has ended specific mining services like selling mining rigs and also cloud-hosting operations to Chinese residents. Okex has “stopped trading platform currency with RMB,” according to the local reporter Colin ‘Wu’ Blockchain. Following the announcements from Okex and Huobi, bitcoin (BTC) prices started to show some recovery.Now two mining operations have revealed ceasing services to Chinese residents as well. Btc.top, a large mining pool that commands 1.7% of the global hashrate, detailed that it has “suspended its China business citing regulatory risks.” In a similar instance, the mining operation Hashcow also detailed that the firm would stop purchasing mining devices.Since the initial bitcoin mining warning on May 21, the overall BTC hashrate has declined. At the time of publication, the hashrate is around 140 exahash per second (EH/s), after it was riding above the 158 EH/s zone 24 hours earlier. No other mining operations have made any announcements about ceasing operations in China besides Btc.top and Hashcow’s recent statements.Meanwhile, Primitive Ventures’ founding partner Dovey Wan and Bixen’s Mustafa Yilham have been speaking on the regulatory crackdown situation in China.“In [the] past 48 hours,” Yilham tweeted. “Chinese miners already started to accelerate [the] migrating process to other countries. There will also be large quantities of Bitcoin mining machines available for sales.”What do you think about Btc.top and Hashcow ceasing mining operations with Chinese residents?

CEO Noel Quinn says that HSBC views bitcoin as an asset class rather than a payments vehicle but the bank is not rushing into providing cryptocurrency investments for clients.HSBC CEO Noel Quinn said that the bank “has no plans to launch a cryptocurrency trading desk” or offer cryptocurrencies as investments to customers, Reuters reported Monday.Quinn was quoted as saying: “Given the volatility we are not into bitcoin as an asset class, if our clients want to be there then of course they are, but we are not promoting it as an asset class within our wealth management business … For similar reasons, we’re not rushing into stablecoins.”The HSBC executive explained that he is skeptical of cryptocurrencies partly because it is difficult to assess the transparency of who owns them and the problems with their ready convertibility into fiat money, the news outlet conveyed. Quinn further shared:I view bitcoin as more of an asset class than a payments vehicle, with very difficult questions about how to value it on the balance sheet of clients because it is so volatile.He continued: “Then you get to stablecoins which do have some reserve backing behind them to address the stored value concerns, but it depends on who the sponsoring organization is plus the structure and accessibility of the reserve.”The clarification by HSBC’s CEO regarding cryptocurrency came as China banned financial institutions from providing services related to crypto transactions and reiterated its cryptocurrency crackdown that was announced back in 2017. China is key to HSBC’s growth strategy.HSBC has not been friendly to bitcoin or any cryptocurrencies. In April, the bank changed its policy to bar clients from buying stocks of companies that hold bitcoin, like Microstrategy.Meanwhile, other major banks are launching or planning to launch crypto services, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, DBS, and Citigroup.What do you think about HSBC’s stance on bitcoin and cryptocurrency?

919,Comparing the True Costs of Gold Mining in Africa With Those of Bitcoin Mining,"May 24, 2021","When billionaire Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles, the price of the crypto asset tanked. In justifying this decision, Musk cited bitcoin mining’s inefficient use of electricity as well as its impact on the environment. In fact, before Musk waded into this debate, many opponents of the crypto had repeatedly attacked bitcoin’s energy-consuming transaction confirmation process.As expected, bitcoin maximalists and crypto supporters have been pushing back against what they see as an unbalanced argument. To bitcoiners, the environmental impact claims or electricity costs argument completely ignores the negative externalities associated with the creation/production of alternative stores of value like gold and fiat.Already, a number of reports have not only countered the BTC’s carbon footprint argument but have also exposed the environmental costs of running a conventional currency system. For instance, Bitcoin.com News recently reported another billionaire, Mark Cuban, informing Musk that his organization was going to continue accepting crypto.However, until recently, not many reports had solely focused on the negative externalities that are associated with the extraction of gold. The precious metal, which for centuries had been the traditional alternative store of value, has seen its position being challenged by BTC in the past few years. This challenge has inevitably led gold supporters and bitter opponents of bitcoin like Peter Schiff to wage a war against bitcoin. Now a new report that at least exposes the true costs of gold mining in Africa might swing the initiative away from opponents.The report, which is titled “Illicit Gold Markets in East and South Africa” is an expose of the violence, human trafficking, and corruption that accompanies gold extraction in some parts of Africa. The report—which focuses on artisanal gold mining in Kenya South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe—exposes the real damage to the environment being caused by this type of gold mining. For instance, the report notes how the trade of “illicit mercury”, a substance that has been declared “dangerous to human health and the environment,” is in fact tied to the illicit gold trade in countries like Zimbabwe.In addition, the report, which was commissioned by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GITOC), accuses certain corrupt Zimbabwean officials of “allowing mining in protected areas like Matobo and Umfurudzi national parks.”On the other hand, in South Africa, a globally reputable sustainable producer of gold, shows the presence of illegal gold miners known as the “Zama Zama” that is now adding a taint to this image.According to the report, these illegal miners, who are often foreign nationals from poor backgrounds, are being exploited by criminal gangs. In detailing how these miners are abused, the report states:They can also be forced to work underground for weeks, sometimes before resurfacing. These miners are also exposed to murder, forced migration, money laundering, corruption, racketeering, drugs and prostitution on a scale not seen elsewhere in Africa.In South Sudan, Africa’s youngest country, gold mining is dominated by tens of thousands of artisanal miners who however lack appropriate equipment and safety measures. Consequently, reports from the country reveal that collapsing trenches are responsible “for killing up to 4 miners per month.” In Kenya, mining regions on the borders with South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda are in some of “the most dangerous parts of the country and are considered to be a haven for organized crime.”Meanwhile, throughout this 73-page document, the authors attempt to highlight the true impact, as well as the hidden cost of gold production in these five African countries. Although these revelations might be nothing new to many in Africa, for crypto supporters, this document brings some fresh context to the bitcoin energy use debate. The revelations mean any future comparison of gold and bitcoin should not ignore the points that are raised in the GITOC report. For gold bugs like Schiff, trashing bitcoin while completely ignoring the precious metal’s own issues will be disingenuous.Still, this report also raises an important question: Should bitcoin be judged solely on electricity use or maybe it should be judged based on how it has been pivotal in forcing some central banks to start reforming? If crypto opponents cannot offer a different argument to support the current one, then it will be difficult to argue the case against bitcoin without being accused of bias.So while the likes of Elon Musk might want to continue to propagate bitcoin’s energy mantra, such comments will only have a temporary impact on the crypto economy, as has happened in the past weeks. Genuine interest in BTC and other digital assets will not go away based on the current argument alone. Central banks and governments will have to come up with an alternative that beats both fiat and cryptocurrencies if any efforts to kill BTC are to ever succeed.What are your thoughts on what going on in the gold mining industry in Africa? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

920,Bitcoin Adoption Picks up Steam in Peru After Presidential Ballot,"May 24, 2021","Peru, a country not commonly associated with bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, is experiencing a sizable surge in digital currency adoption following the first round of its presidential ballot process. The presidential candidate with the most vote support, Pedro Castillo, is known for his interventionist policies, so Peruvians might be preparing for what could be considered an economic downturn.The volumes of cryptocurrency traded in Peru have experienced significant growth during the week of the first phase of the presidential ballot, according to reports from Buda, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. This might have to do with how the ballot is expected to be defined, with a candidate with an interventionist take on the economy being the favorite to win.Volumes of cryptocurrency trading shot up nearly 24.14% in the weeks of the presidential ballot, compared to the week before, and it kept growing the week after the elections, increasing by 24.36%. Almost, in the same way, bitcoin trade volumes also increased by 25.10% to 23.05% respectively in those weeks.Pedro Castillo, one of the favorites to win the ballot, has an interventionist policy in regards to economic policy and has talked about nationalizing some key activities in the country, including mining operations, oil industries, and telecommunications. This has created some fears from citizens that might be turning to cryptocurrency to refuge from a currency devaluation in the future.If this political change does happen, Peru might be the next country in LATAM to experience a cryptocurrency trading boom, as Argentina and Venezuela did before. Pedro Castillo is leading the polls with a 44.8% against his opponent, Keiko Fujimori, who trails second with 34.4% of the ballot intention, according to the latest poll from the Peruvian Studies Institute.While it is still too early to predict what might happen in the country if Peru does go down the interventionist road, the currency devaluation might lead to exchange controls, which consequently might lead people to take cryptocurrency as an alternative to hedge their funds.This is what happened in Venezuela and more recently in Argentina, where ailing citizens turned to cryptocurrency in inflationary driven economies. The decentralized nature of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make them perfect for this use case because they cannot be controlled by the states seeking to thwart the economic liberties of its citizens.What do you think about the rise in cryptocurrency adoption in Peru? Tell us in the comments section below.

The economist now suggests thinking of the cryptocurrency “as a cult that can survive indefinitely.” Nonetheless, Krugman still believes that bitcoin has no fundamentals.Nobel laureate Paul Krugman said on Twitter last week that he has given up on predicting bitcoin’s demise. Krugman won The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 “for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity,” The Nobel Prize’s website shows. The economist tweed last week:I’ve given up predicting imminent demise. There always seem to be a new crop of believers. Maybe just think of it as a cult that can survive indefinitely.Krugman is still not a fan of bitcoin, however, insisting that the cryptocurrency does not have any fundamentals to discuss.“BTC isn’t a new innovation; it’s been around since 2009, and in all that time nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it,” Krugman opined. “It’s not a convenient medium of exchange; it’s not a stable store of value; it’s definitely not a unit of account.”In an opinion piece published Thursday in The New York Times, Krugman compared the crypto craze to a Ponzi scheme. “Twelve years on, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in normal economic activity. Almost the only time we hear about them being used as a means of payment — as opposed to speculative trading — is in association with illegal activity, like money laundering or the bitcoin ransom Colonial Pipeline paid to hackers who shut it down,” Krugman described, adding:Why are people willing to pay large sums for assets that don’t seem to do anything? The answer, obviously, is that the prices of these assets keep going up, so that early investors made a lot of money, and their success keeps drawing in new investors.“Its value rests on the perception that it’s a technologically sophisticated way to protect yourself from the inevitable collapse of fiat money, which is coming one of these days, or maybe one of these centuries. Or, as I say, libertarian derp plus technobabble,” the economist also tweeted.“This may sound to you like a speculative bubble, or maybe a Ponzi scheme — and speculative bubbles are, in effect, natural Ponzi schemes,” Krugman continued. “But could a Ponzi scheme really go on for this long? Actually, yes: Bernie Madoff ran his scam for almost two decades, and might have gone even longer if the financial crisis hadn’t intervened … Now, a long-running Ponzi scheme requires a narrative — and the narrative is where crypto really excels.”Nonetheless, the Nobel Prize-winning economist concluded:Are cryptocurrencies headed for a crash sometime soon? Not necessarily.What do you think about Paul Krugman’s view on bitcoin and cryptocurrency? Let us know in the comments section below.

922,"BTC Supporters Call Price Drop a Mid-Bull Run Break, 2021 Bitcoin Chart Pattern Similar to 2013 Bull Run","May 23, 2021","After the price of bitcoin touched a high of $64,895 per unit, speculators and skeptics think it might have been the top of the bull run and a 2018-like bear run is next. On Sunday, May 23, bitcoin prices have dropped to a low of $31,107 and bears have managed to take the reigns for a period. However, not everyone is convinced the current crypto bull run is similar to 2017, as a number of crypto proponents think the 2013 bull run is more aligned with present trends. BTC has seen better days and a month ago, the price reached $64k per coin but four days ago, BTC prices dropped to the lowest price point of 2021 at $30,066 per unit. That’s a massive loss of 53.66% in a month’s time, but bitcoin prices have managed to rise a hair higher than the bottom. However, on Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) prices tapped a low of $31,107 and prices have neared the bottom low once again. Since this market carnage has happened, the capitulation has once again invoked BTC haters and pessimists that have said: “bitcoin is dead.”“Pumpers who assured investors Bitcoin would never crash again now claim the crash is healthy and necessary to purge the market of excess speculation,” Peter Schiff wrote on Sunday. “They say China banning Bitcoin as other governments impose stricter regulations is bullish. Denial ain’t just a river in Egypt,” he added.Some skeptics and pessimists have said, BTC touched a top at $64k per coin, and now the market is entering another ‘crypto winter.’ Many speculators have said the 2021 bull run is similar to the bull run in 2017 and 2018’s bearish consolidation is now in the cards. Despite these theories, there are those who believe BTC’s current run is more reminiscent of 2013’s bull run. On Sunday, the Youtuber and the crypto proponent called “Colin Talks Crypto” tweeted that he believes the current trends may be similar to 2013’s bitcoin rise.“If bitcoin’s 2013 double top behavior repeats, we may be set up for a December 2021 or January 2022 final price peak,” Colin tweeted. “In 2013, we experienced a bitcoin double top, with two major peaks 8 months apart. Note that this is much less time than the 4 years between halving cycles (which is the predominant catalyst for bitcoin bull runs),” he added. Colin also wrote the recorded price of bitcoin in April 2013, which topped at $255, and December 2013 which hit an all-time high (ATH) at $1,150 per unit.Similar to 2013, this year has had some rumors from China talking about alleged crypto trade bans and stopping crypto mining. Pantera Capital co-CIO Joey Krug tweeted about the China situation on May 21 and said: For those new to crypto, we’re now mid-market cycle. We’re at the part where China ‘bans’ Bitcoin 3 times. Happens every cycle (2013, 2017, 2021).” The founder of the Stacks Ecosystem, Muneeb Ali, also tweeted:2013 called and wants its China mining ban stories back.Besides the China FUD, a number of bitcoin supporters agree with Colin Talks Crypto’s assessment, and believe this is a mid-section of the bull run similar to 2013. Bitcoin.com News wrote about Plan B discussing the similarities when he said: “Nothing goes up in a straight line. Bitcoin has gone up 6 months in a row, until this month. This looks like the mid-way dip that we also saw in 2013 and 2017.”The popular Twitter account “Crypto White Walker” also noted:I’ve been saying this run feels more like 2013 rather than 2017 but who knows, I’m just here to share meme charts.Just like Schiff said, it is true that most BTC supporters are still very optimistic about future prices, even after the value slashed in half. Most of the ardent bitcoin supporters on Reddit forums and Twitter still assume the current drop is only a mid-way cycle. The CEO of Civic, Vinny Lingham, otherwise known as the ‘Oracle,’ said on Sunday that BTC looks like a good trade.“The Sharpe ratio on going long BTC right now looks like 2.5+,” Lingham tweeted on Sunday. “Downside is backstopped at previous ATH of $20k, upside could lead to retest $63k. This looks like a good Bitcoin trade, assuming ESG narrative does not further shake the market,” Lingham added.What do you think about people’s assumptions that this run is similar to the 2013 bull run? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

923,"Iran Is Using Bitcoin Mining to Circumvent Sanctions, According to Elliptic","May 23, 2021","Iran is using Bitcoin mining to circumvent and lessen the effect of the economic sanctions that the U.S. and other countries have applied to the country since 2006, according to a new study by Elliptic, a blockchain analytics and financial crime compliance firm. The country is indirectly using bitcoin mining to export part of its energy reserves, whose exports are being hampered by the said sanctions.Iran is leveraging bitcoin (BTC) as a tool to circumvent and lessen the impact of the harsh sanctions that the country is facing, according to a new study from Elliptic, a blockchain crime analysis firm. The investigation, which estimates Iran houses 4.5% of all the bitcoin hashrate in the world, states that the country is using bitcoin indirectly to export its energy reserves.Iran is one of the few countries with abundant oil reserves in the world. However, its capacity to export and use these has been severely limited due to the almost total embargo on oil exports that the U.S. has exerted over the country during the last decade. This has made the government turn to bitcoin mining, as one potential tool for transforming its energy potential into a product the country can profit from.Seemingly, it has worked. Iran’s aging electric structure has had problems handling the load that mining puts on it. The electric tariffs are pretty cheap, a fact that has fueled the cryptocurrency mining craze. Elliptic’s report state that Chinese mining companies have been attracted by this fact, and have even partnered with the military to bring their facilities to the country in a safe way.But how exactly is Iran using Bitcoin to sidestep its limitations? As part of a globalized economy, Iran is effectively getting its energy reserves out to the world by using its oil to produce electricity that is turned into bitcoin through the action of miners in Iran. In this way, Iran is getting an indirect exposure of its oil reserves through potential bitcoin buyers and users.While Iran and Iran-based miners are benefiting from this, the report also raises important alerts about compliance, while using the Bitcoin (BTC) network to transact. Elliptic states that any institutions and individuals sending bitcoin could be breaking these international sanctions. The report states:There is a… chance that any bitcoin transaction will involve the sender paying a transaction fee to a bitcoin miner in Iran. Financial institutions should also be on the lookout for crypto deposits originating from Iranian miners that are seeking to cash out their earnings.There are a number of initiatives that are seeking to thwart this potential illegal activity down. Marathon, a bitcoin mining company based in North America, launched the first OFAC compliant bitcoin mining pool recently, which is now mining only compliant transactions. Other similar initiatives might come in the future due to the institutionalization of BTC as an asset class, that is now fueling institutions to shield themselves from carrying these illegal actions unknowingly.What do you think about Elliptic’s last report?

924,Greenpeace Has Stopped Accepting Bitcoin Donations Due to Network's Environmental Impact,"May 23, 2021","Greenpeace, the ecological NGO, has stopped accepting bitcoin donations due to the big impact the cryptocurrency network has on the environment. The organization, which was one of the first NGOs to add bitcoin to its donations arsenal, has now backpedaled due to the growing energy consumption of the underlying network powering the asset.Greenpeace has stopped accepting bitcoin donations due to the big environmental impact that the energy consumption that the Bitcoin network is having. The NGO declared in an article earlier this week that they would be scraping this payment functionality, though they didn’t receive many donations in the form of cryptocurrency. Greenpeace stressed:“As the amount of energy needed to run bitcoin became clearer, this policy became no longer tenable,”Greenpeace was one of the first environmentally-focused NGOs of its kind to adopt and embrace bitcoin as a way of getting more support behind its green flag. It announced back in 2014 it was using Bitpay as their payment provider for this action, and they didn’t have any concerns with energy consumption at the time.However, times have changed, and this is now this kind of issue the environmental activist group is rallying behind. The concerns that Bitcoin can grow too big using too many resources in the process. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, was one of the first ones that raised alarms concerning the carbon footprint of Bitcoin recently. Tesla also stopped accepting bitcoin payments due to environmental concerns surrounding the currency.However, more than Bitcoin, it is its consensus mechanism that’s being criticized as being too dirty and energy-consuming. Bitcoin is a proof of work-based currency, meaning that participants in the network musk confer a certain kind of effort to the network to operate. These participants are called miners, and they use specialized hardware to maximize their gains over others miners in the network.It’s this vast amount of specialized hardware that makes Bitcoin secure, and paradoxically, the one that spends vasts amounts of energy doing so. According to Digiconomist, the whole network has a carbon footprint comparable to Portugal’s carbon footprint and consumes as much power as the Netherlands currently.Other reports disagree with the estimates recorded by the Digiconomist and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance’s (CCAF) estimates as well. Both estimates have large discrepancies between each recorded number, and Bitcoin.com News was told that the “CBECI map hasn’t been updated for some time now,” in December 2020.But it could be worst in the long run: Digiconomist’s last report claims that bitcoin could consume as much energy as all of the data centers in the world, and have a carbon footprint comparable to London’s. Yet bitcoin advocates wholeheartedly believe that proof of work-based currencies can be energy efficient. This is also the case with Elon Musk, who is working with Dogecoin developers to achieve better energy numbers for the meme-centric currency.What do you think about Greenpeace not accepting bitcoin donations anymore? Tell us in the comments section below.

925,"Mystery Bitcoin Whale from 2010 Disappears, Dormant Address from 2013 Sees Strange Activity","May 22, 2021","Toward the latter half of 2020 and during the first quarter of 2021, a mystery miner spent 200 block rewards from 2010 by transferring 10,000 bitcoin during the year. Since the whale’s last 1,000 bitcoin spend on March 23, the patterns of 20 decade-old strings of coinbase rewards are seemingly over. Meanwhile, only eight block rewards from 2010 have been spent since the whale’s last string of spends. Alongside this, approximately 21 block rewards from 2011 have been spent since the March 23 report.60 days ago, Bitcoin.com News caught the last spend from the mega-whale miner who transferred 10,000 sleeping bitcoins mined back in 2010. The 10,000 bitcoin was spent during the course of a 12-month period with 200 blocks from 2010 moved. The mystery whale has not returned since then, and it seems that the entity may be done transferring strings of 20 consecutive block rewards that were well over ten years old in age.The whale was notable because each string of 20 block rewards from 2010 was spent in a single block and most likely stemmed from the same miner. The spending pattern of 10,000 bitcoin (BTC) from the 2010 era was always the same and never deviated from the prior spending schemes.The research in those reports was bolstered by the blockchain parsing engine Btcparser.com, members of the Telegram channel “gfoundinsh*t,” the blockchain researcher Issak Shvarts and the gfoundinsh*t leader Taisia. At the time, Shvarts had said he believed that the thousands of bitcoin from the 2010 block rewards were sold to Coinbase customers.Taisia was also instrumental during the recent move by the Bitfinex hackers. The hackers recently moved thousands of BTC from the August 2016 breach. Since the last 20 block spend on March 23, which saw 1,000 BTC mined in 2010 move to another address, only eight 2010 blocks have been spent since then.It’s also interesting to note that the mystery miner leveraged the most opportune selling times to transfer the BTC if he/she or they decided to sell the coins. BTC’s price has since retreated from a high of $64k per unit to a $30k bottom on May 18, 2021.Bitcoin’s value managed to jump back above the $40k zone, but since then the value has been riding a couple of thousand dollars below that rate. Out of the eight, 2010 block rewards spent during the last 60 days, three of the blocks worth 150 BTC total were likely mined by the same owner.In between that 60-day spread, there’s been some strange activity from coins obtained in 2013. On May 4, the Telegram channel operated by the blockchain parser known as “Whale Alert,” published dozens of messages that repeated the same messages.It said: “A dormant address containing 500 BTC (26,960,325 USD) has just been activated after 7.4 years (valued at 429,542 USD in 2013).”At the time BTC was exchanging hands at prices between $57k to $59k. Not too long after the dormant 2013 address transfer, bitcoin’s average price plummeted to roughly $53k per unit on May 12.Two-month stats also show that approximately 21 random block rewards from 2011 have been spent since the mystery whale transfer at the end of March. While 2010 block reward spends are taking place less, especially since the mega whale is ostensibly complete, coinbase rewards from 2011 have been far more prominent.Although, a 2010 block was transferred on May 21, and it was mined on September 18, 2010, while another 2010 coinbase reward mined on July 15, 2010, was spent on May 14.What do you think about the frequency of old sleeping bitcoin spends in 2021?

926,Fraudsters Impersonate a US Federal Agency by Sending Emails Asking for Bitcoin Wallet Keys,"May 22, 2021","U.S. consumers have been receiving fake emails that attempt to impersonate a federal regulatory agency which has raised alarms among crypto community members. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) warned that such bogus messages ask people for their bitcoin wallet keys.According to the alert published by the OCC, the fake email claims to be signed by senior officials of the agency. They took the opportunity to warn people that the federal entity holds no virtual currencies, such as bitcoin (BTC), on behalf of other agencies or deals with digital assets whatsoever.Scammers who elaborated the message didn’t take care of grammatical mistakes and typos notably highlighted all over the phony email, which reads as follows:US COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY: Your fund $10.5M is ready to be paid to you.Note your fund can only be paid to you VIA a Bitcoin Wallet Address ID NO:Due to too much charges/fees been demanded by the banks and government officials befoethey can sign for the release of funds belonging to foreigners,the IMF.UNITED NATIONS and WORLD BANK have made a new policy that any debt or payment belonging to an individual above $1M should be paid through a bitcoin wallet address. You are instructed to provide with immediate effect a bitcoin wallet address id no,for your fund to be credited on the wallet for you now. Signed NAME REMOVED / Director US COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCYCThe OCC issued the following comment to warn people about the spam campaign launched by fraudsters:“Do not respond in any manner to any proposal purported to be issued by the OCC that requests personal account information or requires the payment of any fee in connection with the proposal, or that suggests the OCC is a participant in the transfer of funds for or on behalf of others.”Crypto-related scams have been on the rise in the United States, as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) addressed the issue recently with a warning.The warning came in the wake of reports which unveiled that over $2 million has been taken by fraudsters impersonating the Tesla CEO Elon Musk and using virtual currencies scams.What are your thoughts on the scam impersonating the U.S. banking regulator?

He calls the bitcoin plunge a “liquidation event” that feels like capitulation.The Galaxy Digital CEO has long been pro-bitcoin. In his view, recovery will take some time. “Humpty Dumpty never gets put back together in two days … when he cracks,” he opined. “It’s going to take a while. The market will consolidate. It will find a bottom somewhere. I’m hoping it’s close to here.” However, Novogratz emphasized:The story hasn’t gone anywhere. This crypto revolution has happened, but these are certainly setbacks for the wallets and for the investor base. People lost a lot of money, so they’ll dust themselves off.Commenting on a recent JPMorgan research claiming that investors are moving away from bitcoin into gold, Novogratz remained optimistic on the long-term adoption of bitcoin.“I see a movement,” he further shared, adding that he was out with two bank CEOs last month and both were fascinated with decentralized finance (Defi). “I just see an inexorable move from financial institutions and tech companies into the crypto space,” he affirmed.Novogratz pointed to several factors behind the falling price of bitcoin in recent weeks, including comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk regarding bitcoin mining’s energy usage after Tesla decided to stop accepting bitcoin for payments.The Galaxy Digital executive concluded:A lot more people own crypto. Crypto has seeped into pockets all over our society and you had a confluence of events — a combination of tax day, Elon Musk tweets, whatnot, where you started breaking down the positivity in the price action, and now we’ve got a liquidation event.Do you agree with Mike Novogratz about bitcoin and the crypto revolution?

929,'Reiterated FUD' - Chinese Government to Continue Monitoring Bitcoin Mining Sector,"May 21, 2021","A recent report from the Chinese government’s financial committee has reiterated the country’s stance on bitcoin mining and that it would continue to monitor the sector closely. The report follows a recent article from Reuters published three days ago, which also reiterates China’s older warnings against the crypto industry.On Friday, a report stemming from China’s 51st meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission led by the organization’s director, Liu He, discussed cryptocurrency mining in the country. Liu He is also the vice-premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.On Friday morning, the regional reporter Colin ‘Wu Blockchain’ also reported on the meeting’s disclosure and said:This is the first time that the highest level of the Chinese government has clearly proposed a blow to the mining industry.Although, a great number of crypto enthusiasts disagreed with Wu’s assessment of the situation. “Reiterated fud… Law has been in place for years,” one individual responded to Wu’s tweet. The individual also pointed to older articles from 2017 that reiterated the same talking points as what was said in the recent meeting presided by Liu He.The regional reporter continued his analysis despite the detractors.“The impact of this incident is still uncertain, but it is possible that all public mining activities in China will be banned, and exchanges may face severe blows,” the Chinese journalist wrote. “Although Chinese government also stated that it will crack down on bitcoin transactions, it mainly focuses on another sentence ‘preventing the transfer of personal risks to society,’ which means that they pay more attention to social stability rather than personal transactions,” Wu said in another tweet. The journalist continued:As for cracking down on mining, it may be related to Musk’s recent attack on Bitcoin’s energy consumption. The Chinese government made a commitment to carbon neutrality to the world last year. Unfortunately, bitcoin mining was the first to hit.The price of bitcoin (BTC) did drop after this announcement went viral across social media platforms and a number of news desks. However, just as the individual who wasn’t impressed by Wu’s reporting, a large majority of the crypto community thinks this China stuff is recycled FUD. The deeper skepticism has been caused by a recent Reuters’ report published three days ago. The report’s headline said: “China bans financial, payment institutions from cryptocurrency business.”This too was a problem for the crypto community, as people believed that recent Reuters’ report was exaggerating a reiterated talking point. For instance, Qiao Wang from Defi Alliance tweeted about the situation, after Reuters published the banning report earlier this week.“3 dumb things happened within the last hour: 1) Reuters writing a misleading article on China banning. 2) People retweeting Reuters and believing it. 3) Market dumping on the Reuters news. China didn’t just ban crypto. It’s reiterating an anti-speculation law from years ago,” Wang stressed that day.Wang also seems skeptical of Friday’s bitcoin mining news stemming from China’s 51st meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission and Wu’s recent tweets.“This latest ‘China ban’ lacks details. It’s some high level guidance,” Wang said. “We’ll see if there’s any concrete actions. It feels different to the extent that I don’t recall China has ever made any serious attempt to crack down on ‘mining.’ Just ‘speculation,’” he added.What do you think about the recent update on bitcoin mining from China’s Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission?

At Cash2Bitcoin you can talk to a real person on the phone and support agents are ready to assist you Mon-Fri, 9am-6pm EST.Security is also better at an ATM as you don’t need to link a bank account or credit card like at an online exchange that can hacked – just use the amount of cash you want – and Cash2Bitcoin also works hard to keep your information secure and encrypted. It is a U.S. registered company and operates in full compliance with all federal and applicable state laws.In addition to all the above, Cash2Bitcoin also offers very competitive rates.

931,"Crypto Prices Consolidate, Analysts Blame Bitcoin Market Rout on 'Overleveraged Positions'","May 21, 2021","Digital currency markets have been consolidating after taking some heavy losses during the last few days. Billions of dollars have jumped back into the crypto economy on Thursday, as the overall market valuation of all coins in existence has jumped back to $1.75 trillion on Friday. Bitcoin is resting above the $40k handle but the leading crypto is still down 17% during the last seven days. Bitcoin and a number of digital currency markets have been healing and consolidating after taking some deep losses during the course of the last week. Currently, bitcoin (BTC) is down 3% during the past 24 hours and down 17% for the week. Reported volume on Friday shows around $71 billion in global trades, but Messari.io’s ‘real volume’ stats show BTC volume is really around $19.2 billion.The largest trading pair with bitcoin (BTC) today is tether (USDT) as it captures 51% of all trades on Friday. This is followed by the USD (19.58%), BUSD (7.04%), JPY (6.42%), EUR (5.68%), and KRW (2.51%). USDC (2.1%) and GBP (1.7%) are just below the top trading pairs with BTC this week.Meanwhile, BTC dominance has increased since dropping to a low of 41% earlier in the week. At press time BTC dominance is hovering at around 43.3% while ethereum (ETH) is down to 17.7% today.Looking at the 4-hour BTC/USD chart stemming from Bitstamp shows most oscillators and moving averages are either signaling neutral or strong sell sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is impartial at ~33.11 and Stochastic is nonpartisan as well at 31.63. The two Simple Moving Averages (SMA 100-200) show the short-term SMA 100 dipped below the SMA 200 trendline. This indicates that the path toward the least resistance is currently the downside and bulls seem to be slowing down after meeting stronger hindrances these last few days. Although, the momentum oscillator MACd suggests a stronger buy signal and some more improvement is on the cards going forward.In a note sent to Bitcoin.com News on Friday, Anatoly Crachilov, the cofounder and CEO of Nickel Digital explained that overleveraged positions catapulted the deep losses last week.“In April, bitcoin’s valuation hit an all-time high, delivering 122% gain from the beginning of the year, while ethereum has demonstrated an even more impressive run of 479%,” Crachilov said. “This rally attracted billions of dollars of both institutional and retail capital. While the former often comes in the form of portfolio allocations, the latter is often driven by speculative considerations, in most cases with the use of significant leverage,” the Nickel Digital executive added. Crachilov further said:These overleveraged positions bring vulnerability to the market, making it excessively sensitive to negative news flow. A combination of statements coming from Vitalik Buterin, Elon Musk, and Chinese authorities in a space of a week was sufficient to trigger a market correction. This was exacerbated by a cascade of auto liquidations of overleveraged positions on crypto exchanges, which amounted to over $9 billion in 24 hours, one of the largest volumes of liquidations ever. Alongside Crachilov’s commentary, Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani also spoke to Bitcoin.com News to share his insights. Balani is a UBS alumnus that gained financial, derivatives, and quantitative financial experience through his positions at Edelweiss Asset Management and Elara Capital. Balani’s market insight also discussed the overleveraged positions that were liquidated this week.“The sharp move in BTC on Wednesday was due to massive liquidations. We had pointed out in our previous weekly newsletter that Bitcoin had lost momentum and was looking weak,” Balani wrote on Friday. “There was too much leverage in the system (evident from 40%+ annual premium on bitcoin futures) and as the price started to slip these levered longs went into liquidations. Congestion on chains, downtime on exchanges etc. further added fuel to the fire as traders were not able to furnish margins on time and a cascading effect pushed the price lower.”Balani further added that his team believes that most of the leverage is out of the system now and bitcoin should start to form a foundation here. “However, the sharp fall – 40% between Sunday & Wednesday – has eroded confidence and it will take some time for BTC to regain upward momentum. Bitcoin wiped out the bulk of its gains for YTD,” Balani stressed. The Delta Exchange CEO added:The bounce has been sharp and it looks like the bottom is in but the price action till the end of the month is going to be critical. The $36,000 level has acted as good support here. A conclusive break below that would signal that this correction is bigger than a short-term bull market pull-back and all bets are off.What do you think about today’s crypto market action and recent bitcoin prices?

She says that all indicators “are all suggesting that we are in a capitulation phase, which is a really great time to buy, no matter what the asset is.”Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has shared her view about the current bitcoin market and her prediction of where the price of the cryptocurrency will rise to in an interview with Bloomberg Wednesday.Wood has previously predicted that the price of bitcoin will increase to $500K. With the current market turbulence and sell-offs across a broad range of cryptocurrencies, she was asked if she still stands by her forecast.Referencing work done by her firm’s crypto analyst, Wood replied, “We do. I do,” emphasizing:Yes, our conviction is as high.She continued: “The one thing that has changed here, however, is the environmental concerns around bitcoin, in particular, have caused people like Elon Musk to pull away and say, ‘Woah, let me make sure I understand this.'”Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, recently announced that it has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments due to environmental concerns. However, Musk has confirmed that Tesla has not sold its bitcoins. Furthermore, when the price of bitcoin plummeted this week, Musk tweeted diamond hands emojis suggesting that Tesla will not sell its bitcoins.Referring to the environmental concerns some people, like Musk, have, Wood detailed: “We believe that even this is going to change because, first of all, right now the percentage of bitcoin mined with renewables and hydroelectric power is quite substantial. I think in China it’s over 50% in renewables.”She also referenced a paper Ark Invest wrote with Square Inc. arguing that “Bitcoin is key to an abundant, clean energy future.” This week, Ark also argued that bitcoin mining could be a net positive for the environment.When asked how low the price of bitcoin could fall to from its current level, Wood said, “You never know how low is low when the market gets very emotional.” She added that “A lot of traders see bitcoin dropping below the 200-day moving average, which was at $40,000. So traders, once that happened, they just dump. Some just dump and run.”Nonetheless, the Ark Invest CEO said, “I think we are in a capitulation phase.” She elaborated that all the indicators “are all suggesting that we are in a capitulation phase, which is a really great time to buy, no matter what the asset is. A capitulation phase is buy. It’s on sale.”While acknowledging that some traders may continue to sell their crypto holdings, Wood emphasized:All of our indicators are saying this is capitulation right now.Do you agree with Cathie Wood about bitcoin?

933,Blockfi Messes up Promo Payments: Transfers up to 700 Bitcoin Mistakenly,"May 20, 2021","Blockfi, a cryptocurrency lending platform, wrongly distributed a set of payments to a group of customers, who found deposits of up to 700 BTC in their accounts. While most weren’t able to withdraw these funds, in the confusion, other customers that applied for withdrawals are now being threatened with legal actions against them.Blockfi, one of the most popular cryptocurrency lending and borrowing platforms in the cryptocurrency sphere, mistakenly overpaid bonuses to a group of customers, with some receiving up to 700 BTC in their accounts. According to reports, these payments were related to a stablecoin promotion Blockfi is running, that would give additional benefits to customers to maintain a determinate balance of dollars in their Blockfi Interest Accounts. The bonuses also included income from enrolling partners into the platform.Seems that Blockfi issued stablecoins sums of payments, but in bitcoin, sending some users BTC instead of GUSD, the currency the mentioned promotion advertised. The issue first blew up in social media, where customers of the company gloated about the payments, while others were concerned about the financial stability of the platform after issuing these oversized bonuses. It seems that a part of these funds was indeed withdrawn from the platform.But this problem has also affected customers that did not have intentions of taking advantage of this whole situation. This is the case exposed by a customer in Reddit. The client has been accused of wrongdoing, and Blockfi is allegedly threatening to pursue legal actions against him. However, this issue seems to have affected the whole operative capacity of the platform, with customers complaining about a whole slew of different issues in the subreddit of the company.After all of this happened, Blockfi addressed the fact by issuing a statement via Twitter, in which the company acknowledged the problem. It informed that the vast majority of these funds were quickly identified and reversed immediately, but approximately 100 customers were able to withdraw these funds. However, Blockfi stressed that:The company’s exposure is currently approximately $10M and decreasing quickly as clients are returning funds. We are incredibly grateful for our clients understanding the mistake and returning funds that did not belong to them.While the company declared this mistake doesn’t imply any financial risks, having over 15 billion AUM, and that customers’ funds are safe, the confidence that many had in the company has eroded for some individuals. After this troublesome affair, some users have reported they are leaving the platform altogether as a result of this issue. The company further declared it will learn from its mistakes, having “implemented procedures to prevent issues like this from occurring in the future.”What do you think about Blockfi’s erroneous promo payments mistake?

934,"Bitcoin Hashrate Slides- Low BTC Prices, Sichuan Wet Season, Upcoming Difficulty Spike to Blame","May 20, 2021","While bitcoin prices plummeted this week, the network’s hashrate has also dropped considerably since tapping a high on May 9. Since then, the hashrate has seen swings between 10-15% because of the crypto market downturn, alleged issues with power outages in Sichuan, China, and the upcoming difficulty change.Bitcoin’s hashrate has been fluctuating in recent days after the price of BTC dropped significantly in value during the last week. After some recovery, bitcoin (BTC) market data shows that seven-day stats indicate a weekly loss of 15% on Thursday afternoon (EST).The network’s hashrate or processing power has also followed the downward slide. There are numerous factors that show why the hashrate has slumped, as bitcoin’s price drop is just one of the reasons.Another reason for the hashrate fluctuations stems from reports in China. According to the reporter Colin Wu or “Wu Blockchain” on May 16, “the Bitcoin hashrate of the entire network plummeted.” Wu said that Antpool, F2pool, Binance Pool, and Huobi Pool all saw hashrate percentage losses.“People in the Sichuan industry pointed out that it should be a temporary phenomenon,” Wu remarked. In fact, the hashrate started climbing northbound again after Wu’s Twitter statements. Wu said, however, that the power consumption in China is in heavy demand at the moment. Wu further stressed:The main reason is that the local weather is hot and the industrial power consumption is large, but the water flow of hydropower is insufficient, which is 30% less than in rainy years. The power company decided to start a temporary blackout of the mine at 2 pm on the 16th.Grid issues in China have always plagued miners throughout the years, especially during the wet season in Sichuan. The wet season helps the flow of hydropower, but the natural elements can also cause flooding and power outages as well.China’s mining dominance is not the only reason the hashrate dip has been in play. Another reason why the hashrate is dropping lower might be because of the predicted difficulty spike coming up in nine days.Bitcoin’s mining difficulty tapped a lifetime high as Bitcoin.com News reported last week, and at the time of the report, the difficulty change was an estimated 13 days away. BTC miners might be ‘gaming the network’ in order to drop the difficulty to a lower metric.If BTC miners let the hashrate ride high above the 180 to 200 exahash per second (EH/s) range to this day, then the difficulty would have jumped to an estimated 30.30 trillion. At the time of writing, BTC’s mining difficulty is 25.0 trillion and instead of jumping to 30.30T, current estimates show a smaller 2.90% spike to 25.77T.What do you think about Bitcoin’s hashrate dropping following issues in China, the price drop, and the upcoming difficulty spike?

936,"Elon Musk Invented Bitcoin, if You Ask Half of Australians Polled by Finder","May 20, 2021","Australians have been learning more and more about cryptocurrencies but it turns out some myths and misconceptions are still widespread among the general public Down Under. As a most stunning example, over half of the participants in a new poll by Finder believe Elon Musk invented the first crypto network, Bitcoin. The comparison website Finder.com has recently surveyed 1,000 Australians to gauge their knowledge about Bitcoin. The study, conducted through its Consumer Sentiment Tracker, found that a staggering 98% of the respondents were unable to answer correctly a total of 8 true or false questions regarding the cryptocurrency.“Bitcoin is not taxed” produced the most obvious discrepancy with reality, with 59% of the participants determining that the statement is true. Cryptocurrency profits, Finder notes, may be treated either as income or an investment for tax purposes.“When you sell it, you’ll need to pay capital gains tax on your earnings. We recommend you seek independent advice from an accountant,” the authors add.A popular myth is that “Elon Musk invented Bitcoin,” and not some anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The founder of Tesla and Spacex denied the speculation a long time ago but 56% of Australians still agree with it. Men (62%) are more likely to make that mistake than women (51%). The famous entrepreneur turned-crypto-influencer often pushes markets up or down with his tweets, which has probably led to the false impression.Many of the respondents are also convinced that BTC is older than it actually is, with 44% backing the claim that “Bitcoin has been around for more than 15 years.” And another 44% think “There is an unlimited number of Bitcoins to be mined,” when the supply is finite, limited to a maximum of 21 million. Over half of Generation Z members (51%) believe in the false statement compared to only a third of Baby Boomers (34%).Many Australians are not aware of the great number of cryptocurrencies that have been created since the birth of Bitcoin. Of the surveyed, 39% were positive that “There are less than 100 different cryptocurrencies.” In fact, more than 9,000 crypto coins exist and the number is constantly growing. Then almost a third of participants in the study, 31%, estimate that “One Bitcoin is worth more than AU$100,000” (approx. $77,000) putting its price well above the current market rate.Another wrong assumption shared by 31% of the interviewed is that “You can’t use Bitcoin to buy things.” In reality, thousands of businesses across Australia accept cryptocurrency payments, Finder remarks.“There are Bitcoin ATMs and debit cards that make it easy to convert your Bitcoins to cash and spend them like any other currency,” the site’s report elaborates. But what’s even more surprising is that a fifth of Australians (22%) are sure that “Bitcoins are a physical currency.”The survey comes out as a Senate committee tasked to explore options to implement new financial technologies in the country is preparing to finalize an inquiry that started back in 2019. The Senate Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre is planning to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets following in the footsteps of similar jurisdictions such as Canada and the European Union.What do you think about the findings in the survey?

937,Bitcoin Pizza Initiative Launched Among Heavy Criticism: Only Fiat Accepted,"May 19, 2021","The Bitcoin Pizza initiative, a new endeavor promoted by Bitcoin influencer Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, that seeks to fund Bitcoin development while remembering Lazlo Hanyecz’s legendary pizza purchase, was launched yesterday. While being applauded by some, it also raised a lot of criticism from the cryptocurrency community due to its proposition.Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, the known cryptocurrency influencer, launched a new endeavor called Bitcoin Pizza. The business objective is to remember the now mythical purchase that Lazlo Hanyecz made 11 years ago, while helping the bitcoin developer community at the same time. The initiative includes bitcoin users, local businesses in 10 different U.S. cities, and custom packaging to create a new brand for this purpose.The pizzas will be available starting next Saturday, and users who would like to purchase these pizzas will have to order through a local vendor, that will have custom branding boxes available, preparing the pizza in six different presentations already defined on the site. These flavors are heavily influenced by Bitcoin-based memes: “Laser Eyes,” “Satoshi’s Favorite,” “No Keys No Cheese,” “Lightning Meat,” and “Capital Greens.”Bitcoin Pizza aims to deliver 10,000 pizzas this Saturday, the 11th anniversary of Hanyecz’s purchase. Pomp commented on social media that the full proceeds of this sale will go to fund Bitcoin Development via the Bitcoin Development Fund invoked by the Human Rights Foundation. The fund has collected $316,303 from 112 donors so far, supporting several devs and wallet teams linked to the cryptocurrency since its establishment.While this idea was received with enthusiasm by a part of the cryptocurrency sphere, who was eager to support this initiative, another part of it criticized the idea for a simple reason: Local vendors will only accept credit cards for its pizzas, leaving bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies out of the picture for paying.For them, the whole idea of commemorating Pizza Day is to experience the same that Hanyecz experienced back in the day when he paid for his pizza with Bitcoin. However, Pomp fired back. The influencer tweeted an answer stating:We don’t want people giving up their bitcoin for pizza, but rather we are working to raise money in the form of depreciating fiat dollars to help fund bitcoin development.Pompliano implied he is in fact protecting investors by accepting dollars instead of bitcoin.What do you think about the Bitcoin Pizza initiative?

938,Survey: Crypto Traders Predict Ethereum's ROI to 'Crush' Bitcoin's 2021 Year-End Return,"May 19, 2021","Bitcoin and a slew of digital assets have seen massive drops in value during the last few days, while the top two leading crypto assets bitcoin and ethereum have been battling for market supremacy. This week, bitcoin’s towering dominance over the crypto economy has dropped to a three-year low tapping 41.9%, while ethereum’s market cap has captured 18.6% of the crypto economy. Now a recently published Benzinga poll shows survey participants believe ethereum will “crush” bitcoin’s 2021 year-end return.Benzinga, a fintech media and data company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan has published a report called “Ethereum Predicted to Crush Bitcoin’s ROI in 2021.” The survey has obtained data from 100 cryptocurrency traders and investors and many believe ethereum will soon be the top crypto asset.80.8% polled in Benzinga’s survey indicate that ETH will outperform BTC “through the end of 2021.” Benzinga further explains that ethereum is already commanding the return-on-investment (ROI) lead in 2021 so far.Despite the favoritism toward ethereum over bitcoin, Benzinga participants are still “bullish on bitcoin,” according to the company’s latest poll. “Only 12.8% of respondents believe that Bitcoin will close the year below the $55k mark,” the Benzinga content creator Logan Ross details.Ethereum predictions were more positive, as far as the survey’s price targets were concerned.“Only 20.5% of crypto investors believe that Ethereum will close the year below $4k, while 11.8% said that Ethereum will end the year over $10k,” Ross’s report highlights. “The majority believe that ETH will end the year between $6-10k.”When Ross asked the 100 participants what the most interesting project built on top of the Ethereum network was to them, respondents spoke about ETH 2.0 staking.“The incoming ETH 2, staking is open which will cause many to buy and unable to sell if they stake to promote the new blockchain, (including myself),” a participant told Benzinga. “I believe this will drive the price higher until ETH 2 is released, then a huge sell-off creating a perfect opportunity to ‘buy the dip.’”Benzinga’s report comes at a time when bitcoin (BTC) has been threatened by ethereum (ETH) in recent months. Bitcoin.com News reported earlier this week that BTC was getting its market dominance siphoned by ETH and a number of other digital assets.The website called “The Flippening Watch” has been gathering data in real-time as well in order to record the event if it comes to fruition. As far as data from daily mining rewards are concerned, ETH has already beat BTC in this arena.There are two other metrics ethereum is gunning for which include overall market valuations and 24-hour trade volumes. At the time of publication, BTC still commands these positions, but ETH is getting awfully close to flipping the leading crypto asset. Currently, ETH captures 68.2% of BTC’s daily trade volume today, and 44.6% of BTC’s overall market cap. If ETH outperforms BTC in 2021 and captures a higher market valuation, then a flippening will unfold before the crypto community’s eyes.What do you think about the Benzinga recent survey with 100 crypto traders?

939,'Bitcoin Is Dead'- Crypto Market Carnage Invokes Haters and BTC Obituaries,"May 19, 2021","Digital currency markets have shed billions in value over the past week and during the market carnage, bitcoin haters have come out in flocks. Moreover, according to numerous crypto skeptics, bitcoin has officially died 21 times this year and this week’s downturn is sure to provide another eulogy.On April 14, 2021, the price of bitcoin (BTC) tapped an all-time price high at $64,895 per unit, and then slid to a low of $30,066 a touch over a month later on May 19. That’s a percentage loss of 53% down from the high.BTC has regained some of the losses it has taken on Wednesday morning, but is still down quite a bit from yesterday’s price highs. Market trauma like this causes numerous bitcoin haters to come out of the woodwork, as many feel the need to explain to the public that crypto is nothing more than speculative ‘tulip mania.’On Wednesday, the bitcoin hater Nouriel Roubini tweeted about BTC after the prices plunged to new 2021 lows.“Bitcoin falls more than 40% from its peak in less than one month. Which institutional investors are reckless enough to invest in such a risky and volatile pseudo-asset with no intrinsic value? Roubini asked. “They should be fired on the spot if undertaking such a reckless speculative gamble,” the skeptic further added.The gold bug and economist Peter Schiff believes that this is a full-fledged “bitcoin bear market.”“The most bearish aspect of the Bitcoin bear market is that it’s been slow and steady, at least by Bitcoin standards,” Schiff’s tweet noted on Wednesday. “So far there hasn’t been a crash that would indicate capitulation. Instead, Bitcoin bulls remain steadfast, their faith unshaken as they confidently buy every dip.”Meanwhile, droves of BTC supporters are unshaken it seems, and many believe the bad times will soon be over. “For those new to crypto, please let me introduce our old friend honey badger. Honey badger don’t care,” Watchdog Capital’s Bruce Fenton said on Wednesday.“Not concerned,” the host of the Youtube show ‘Colin Talks Crypto’ stressed. “Bull run is still on. I sold a small bit of BTC and ETH yesterday. Going to re-buy lower,” the Youtuber added on Wednesday.2021 has seen all-time highs (ATH) as far as a number of crypto assets are concerned and BTC spiked 2x higher than 2017’s previous ATH. However, 2021 has seen a number of “Bitcoin Obituary Stats,” as approximately 21 deaths have been recorded on the web portal 99bitcoins.com.BTC had a recent obituary published on May 18, 2021, which was written by The Independent author Tim Mullaney. The death sentence called “The Harsh Truth About Crypto” explains why Mullaney truly believes BTC is “basically nothing.” The Independent author adds:And that’s why the world’s most-traded cryptocurrency is worth basically nothing… Don’t even start on the notion that bitcoin is a currency or a store of value, or a hedge against inflation. The unstable price chart belies all of those notions, as does exposure to bitcoin advocates, none of whom will be running the Federal Reserve soon.Mullaney’s opinion highlights that bitcoin isn’t much of a ‘revolution’ unless someone can tell him what the “revolutionary technology does in the real world.” The author concludes that “Amusing Elon doesn’t count. For crypto, t’aint much.”In addition to Mullaney’s opinion editorial, there’s 20 more obituaries that stress bitcoin is sitting in a casket while this article is written. At the time of publication, at 11:30 a.m. (EST) on Wednesday, bitcoin (BTC) is exchanging hands for $36,979 per unit.What do you think about the recent hate toward bitcoin’s market downturn and the 21 bitcoin obituaries published on 99bitcoins?

940,Sony Files Patent for Bitcoin Wagering on Playstation and Other Consoles,"May 19, 2021","Sony, the electronics giant, has revealed a patent that would introduce bitcoin wagering in its consumer electronic products and consoles, like the Playstation system. Spectators of a game could wager about what will happen next in an e-sports competition, and odds would be calculated by a machine algorithm depending on rankings or previous match history. This could be tied to some movements Sony made earlier this year.Sony, the consumer electronics company, has revealed it filed a patent for gambling or wagering in e-sports competitions that would include bitcoin as a usable currency. The patent, which was filed back in 2019, would include a machine algorithm to calculate the odds of every bet based on the abilities of the players or in the previous match history.The filing mentions this system might be run in a slew of consumer electronic devices, mentioning Sony’s crown jewel, the PlayStation. But it also includes other systems, like consoles made by Microsoft and Nintendo, VR-based entertainment systems, and even personal computers, suggesting the patent has a big scope of implementation. The filing states that:Wagers may be pecuniary, e.g., money or bitcoin, or may be non-pecuniary, e.g., game assets, digital rights, and virtual currency.The filing implies the system would also let users bet in-game currency or assets, or even NFT’s. However, some caveats apply: it’s difficult to ascertain how these wagers would be paid, due to the difficulty of determining the real market value of an NFT or a game asset.This could be another stream of revenue for Sony and the organizations that host e-sports competitions, that have gained popularity during these last years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These competitions and tournaments are followed by millions of players worldwide, and if just a tiny part of this following uses the system, it could transform into a significant form of revenue for the future.While the patent has received some criticism for possibly encouraging gambling in the gaming community, Sony might be betting on gaming becoming more adult, and allowing for this kind of side activities that go with the new trends of gaming and wagering online.This new patent disclosure could have something to do with some of Sony’s previous acquisitions. Sony acquired the Evolution Championship Series, one of the biggest e-sports competition, earlier this year so this might be a part of a coordinated plan to test the system in a comfortable way, with Sony owning all of the elements in the chain. The 2019 edition of the event had more than 9000 participants and was broadcasted to hundreds of thousands of viewers online through Twitch.However, thousands of patents are filed daily and most of them are never implemented, so this could be all speculation. Sony itself introduced the idea of using bananas as controllers in another recent patent, disclose last March.What do you think about Sony’s Bitcoin wagering patent?

941,"Bitcoin Drops Below $40K, Crypto Economy Down 17%, Markets Lost $250 Billion Last Week","May 19, 2021","On Wednesday, cryptocurrency markets continue to drop lower in value, as the entire crypto-economy has plunged 17% below the $2 trillion mark and now rests at $1.801 trillion. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, touched a high of $40,770 per unit at 4:48 a.m. (ET). A few hours after hitting that price range, the crypto asset tapped a low of $36,250 dropping over 11%.Bitcoin (BTC) has lost considerable value during the last few days, alongside a great number of other digital assets that have seen price drops as well. The entire crypto-economy has slid over 17% during the past 24 hours and rests under the $2 trillion range at $1.801 trillion.BTC is currently exchanging hands for $37,544 per unit after tapping a low of $36,250 at around 7:30 a.m. (ET). Seven-day stats show BTC is down over 20% and 30-day records show BTC lost over 30%. Data during the last three months shows BTC is also down 24% on Wednesday.The second-largest crypto asset in terms of market cap, ethereum (ETH) has shed 23% during the last day and 26% for the week. ETH is currently trading for $2,545 per ether but ETH’s market cap still commands 18% of the entire crypto economy. Out of the top ten coins, the two biggest losers today include binance coin (BNB), a top ten coin that lost over 26% in a day, and dogecoin (DOGE), which lost 26% as well. While BNB is swapping for $385 per unit, DOGE is trading for $0.34.Following the BTC drop below the $40k zone, a number of crypto executives and market strategists commented on the price slide. Monark Modi, the founder and CEO of Bitex says that there is heavy profit-taking at the moment and negative market sentiment in the air.“Price volatility in bitcoin has been observed for a while now and the drop from the previous high of $63k down to $40k was expected,” Modi wrote. “Some other factors contributing to the drop are also recent U-turn of Tesla in accepting the most popular cryptocurrency as payments. The investment scenario across the globe has been subdued owing to either government regulations like the ban on crypto trade by China or even closer home in India where investors are facing deposit and withdrawal challenges owing to rumours of financial institutions restricting transactions,” the Bitex CEO further stressed.My #Binance portfolio. Last week vs this week.#Bitcoin #cryptotrading pic.twitter.com/77okD0k1Lx— Shehryar Bukhari (@ShehryarBukhar8) May 19, 2021Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36 also spoke about BTC’s price dropping below the $40k region. “Crypto markets are currently processing a cascade of news that fuels the bear case for price development,” Lykke explained. “Last week, more than 250 billion USD evaporated from the Bitcoin market alone. In absolute terms, such a number may seem astronomical. In terms of percentages, though, such market moves are frequent and we have seen similar ones in the past. In 2017, price dives in the range of 35%+ happened several times before the price topped out,” the ARK36 director said.Meanwhile, on Twitter, the hashtag trend #cryptotrading is trending on Wednesday with thousands of tweets about people getting “rekt” or otherwise “buying the dip.”Crypto investors in APRIL vs MAY #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency #cryptotrading pic.twitter.com/Wmz4OFjffb— Anshu K (@AnshuK10839564) May 19, 2021Quite a few crypto participants tweeted before and after images of themselves going from rich to poor in a month.Ruud Feltkamp, CEO at crypto trading bot Cryptohopper says the leg down was to be expected and there’s been trading opportunities in altcoin markets.“Bitcoin’s current selloff is something that we expected,” Feltkamp said in a note to Bitcoin.com News. “Every year we see that the trading activities decline from May and only really increase again from September. Bitcoin going down like this presents excellent opportunities for traders trading altcoins. If this bull run is a bit like that of 2017, then we expect the real peak of the bitcoin price at the end of this year around New Year’s Eve, after which we will see another Alt season in early 2022,” Feltkamp further noted.Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital said his team is focused on ethereum (ETH) markets. “The shakeup in crypto markets has intensified into Wednesday, with Bitcoin dropping back below $40,000 for the first time since early February and ether (ETH) sinking below $3,000,” Kruger told Bitcoin.com News. “Bitcoin and ether are now off some 40% and 30% respectively from recent record highs,” the LMAX executive said. Kruger further added:Our biggest concern with respect to the outlook right now, and particularly in reference to the price of ether, is that the monthly chart, as referenced in this report, is still showing the price of ether trading at severely overbought readings. This suggests there could be plenty more room for decline before ether finds its feet again.What do you think about today’s cryptocurrency market action?

942,"There's Close to 300,000 Bitcoin-Pegged Tokens Hosted on ETH and BSC, Value Exceeds $12 Billion","May 18, 2021","For quite some time now cryptocurrency traders have been leveraging bitcoin-based assets tethered to alternative blockchains. Mid-May statistics show there’s more than 299,000 bitcoin, worth over $12.8 billion today, tied to wrapped or synthetic bitcoin projects hosted on Ethereum or the Binance Smart Chain.Collateralized crypto tokens with underlying assets like fiat currencies or stocks, bonds, and commodities have been around for years now. In fact, with just fiat currencies alone, the stablecoin market valuation today is around $97.5 billion. During the last two years, bitcoin-pegged tokens have been all the rage, and a significant number of collateralized BTC is tied to alternative chains today.Bitcoin-pegged tokens are hosted on a variety of blockchains and bitcoins are also utilized in the layer 2 solution called the Lightning Network (LN) as well. The LN total-valued locked (TVL) statistics for Tuesday shows there’s around 1,300 BTC or $56.3 million worth of bitcoin used within the layer 2 network.The smart contract project RSK also features bitcoin-pegged tokens called RBTC and there’s 1,594 RBTC ($69 million) in circulation today. 2,914 bitcoins ($126 million) are currently being used as L-BTC for Blockstream’s Liquid network. All three of these platforms combined hold a total of $251 million worth of BTC using today’s bitcoin exchange rates.The aggregate total of Lightning-BTC, RBTC, and L-BTC is child’s play compared to the $12.8 billion dollars in bitcoin tethered to Ethereum (ETH) and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).Ethereum commands the most bitcoin-pegged tokens out of all the schemes deployed today.Data from Dune Analytics shows that 225,975 BTC is connected to Ethereum via a myriad of projects. Deployed BTC-pegged tokens on Ethereum include WBTC (178,865), HBTC (31,906), RENBTC (12,009), IMBTC (1,327), SBTC (1,149), TBTC (1,039), and PBTC (648).The Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) project is by far the largest BTC-pegged platform with over $7 billion in value using today’s BTC exchange rates. WBTC is also the 25th largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization. The Wrapped Bitcoin project’s collateralized BTC is maintained by the project’s custodian Bitgo.Another strong contender in the land of bitcoin-pegged tokens is the BTC token issued on the Binance Smart Chain. Binance’s Bitcoin BEP2 or BTCB is a collateralized bitcoin-based asset with a market valuation just below WBTC’s market cap.At the time of writing, there is 54,598.02 BTCB circulating on the Binance Smart Chain according to stats stemming from coinmarketcap.com. That’s a fully diluted market cap of over $2 billion worth of bitcoin-pegged tokens. During Tuesday’s trading sessions, BTCB had around $159 million in 24-hour trade volume, according to market statistics.Statistics on bscan.com are a touch different than the data that’s been recorded on coinmarketcap.com on May 18, 2021. Records from bscan.com show a total of 80,501 BTCB and a circulating supply of 73,105.515028 BTCB. If bscan.com stats are correct, the number of ETH on BSC stands at 299,080 bitcoin-pegged tokens in circulation today.In terms of decentralized exchange offerings, ETH and BSC also destroy the competition, as far as the number of these trading platforms is concerned. Ethereum dex applications are plentiful, but BSC dex platforms like Pancakeswap have been moving very quickly up the trade volume ranks.ETH-based bitcoin-pegged tokens can be traded on a variety of dex platforms like Uniswap, Sushiswap, 0x Native, Curve, Balancer, Bancor Network, Tokenlon, Dodo, Synthetix, Dydx, Kyber, and Airswap. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has EVM capabilities and BSC tokens can also be swapped on Pancakeswap and Binance Dex. Pegged-bitcoin tokens not only give users the ability to perform cross-chain trading schemes, but BTC tokens on alternative chains can save users money on network fees as well.After Q1 2021 has finished, statistics show that Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain have towered over competitors when it comes to moving BTC on alternative networks, and even layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. It will take a massive effort for any layer 2 solution or sidechain competitor to catch up to these networks, as ETH and BSC continue to fortify their decentralized finance (defi) supremacies.What do you think about the 280,000 bitcoin used on the Ether and BSC networks? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Last month, long bitcoin was the second-most crowded trade, with the most crowded trade being “long tech.”Bank of America surveyed 216 fund managers with $625 billion in total assets under management (AUM) between May 7 and May 13.According to the results, fund managers say “long bitcoin” is the most crowded trade at 43%. The survey notes that being identified as crowded has historically been associated with tops.This was not the first time bitcoin topped the list as the most crowded trade in a Bank of America Fund Manager Survey. It was also the most crowded trade in January before the BTC price hit record highs. The cryptocurrency also topped the chart during the 2017 bull run.Other popular trades among fund managers are long technology, long ESG, and short U.S. treasuries. The survey also found that inflation was identified as the top tail risk.Meanwhile, 75% of the fund managers surveyed said bitcoin is in a bubble zone. This was a slight increase from the previous month when 74% of fund managers said BTC was a bubble. Bank of America itself has also warned about the cryptocurrency being in a bubble.

The company’s CEO Michael Saylor told his Twitter followers that Microstrategy now holds 92,079 bitcoins.Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) has stepped in and bought the dip once again. On Tuesday morning (ET), the firm’s chief executive officer Michael Saylor shared the announcement on Twitter as he usually does. Alongside the CEO’s statements, he also shared the Form 8-K filing that was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On Twitter, Michael Saylor wrote:Microstrategy has purchased an additional 229 bitcoins for $10.0 million in cash at an average price of ~$43,663 per bitcoin. As of 5/18/2021, we hodl ~92,079 bitcoins acquired for ~$2.251 billion at an average price of ~24,450 per bitcoin.The announcement comes after the company purchased $15 million worth of BTC on May 13, 2021. Following the purchase of $10 million worth of BTC on Tuesday, the CEO of the exchange Binance tweeted a response to Saylor’s announcement. “Legend,” Changpeng Zhao otherwise known as “CZ” tweeted.Microstrategy has accumulated a lot of BTC since it started adding the crypto asset to its balance sheet in mid-August 2020. At that time, the business intelligence company said that BTC was “superior to cash” and a “dependable store of value.” Ever since then Microstrategy has been on a bitcoin buying spree and the company’s CEO Michael Saylor has been put on a pedestal by many crypto advocates.The Nasdaq-listed stock MSTR, however, has seen better days. MSTR shares tapped a high on February 9, 2021, but have dropped 62.3% since then. The company’s shares have been seemingly correlated in line with BTC’s price changes. As Bitcoin.com News reported earlier, stocks exposed to digital assets like COIN, RIOT, and CAN have all seen losses since the recent crypto market rout.While crypto markets have recovered some losses, MSTR shares have seen a small increase in value after the opening bell on Tuesday morning.What do you think about Microstrategy’s recent bitcoin purchase worth $10 million?

945,"'Chartmaster' Expects BTC Price to Tap $29K, Delta Exchange CEO Says 'Bitcoin Hasn't Found a Floor Yet'","May 18, 2021","The price of bitcoin has dropped to a new low for the month of May, sliding to $42,100 per unit during Monday evening’s trading sessions. While a few analysts see bitcoin rebounding and gathering new highs in the coming weeks, a few crypto market strategists believe bitcoin prices could sink much lower than today’s current values.The other day, Bitcoin.com News reported on Plan B’s stock-to-flow bitcoin (BTC) price model and how the model’s creator is still positive about the bull run moving forward. A number of other crypto proponents believe that BTC will climb back again and think that a correction was in the cards even before Tesla’s recent announcement.However, a few analysts are talking about much lower BTC prices coming in the weeks ahead as Cornerstone Macro’s Carter Worth believes bitcoin could hit $29k.Cornerstone Macro’s Carter Worth appeared on CNBC this week and stressed that he thinks the current price is a top support region. Worth, who is also called the ‘Chartmaster’ sees BTC dropping 55% from the crypto asset’s high. The ‘Chartmaster’ told “Fast Money” hosts Melissa Lee, Guy Adami, Tim Seymour, Dan Nathan and Brian Kelly “were we to go down 55%, we’d be in the lower end of support.” A 55% drop from BTC’s highs would land just below the $30k region according to stats. Worth further stated:I think we’re in support— it’s fighting, but my hunch is it goes lower. Worth is not the only crypto analyst expecting lower prices. The crypto derivatives trading platform Delta Exchange’s CEO Pankaj Balani also sees BTC sliding lower.In a note sent to Bitcoin.com News, Balani wrote that the leading crypto asset hasn’t hit bottom yet. “Despite a sharp correction and BTC price trading in the support zone of $42,000-$44,000, we don’t think bitcoin has found a floor yet,” Balani said. The Delta Exchange executive added:Unlike the previous dips in bitcoin – in the last 9 months – this time, we are not finding any buyers looking to bottom fish on a sharp move down. Most traders are convinced of further downside and are looking at 35,000-38,000 levels on BTC. The 200 DMA at ~38,000 should act as strong support for bitcoin, but the recovery is going to be slow and we might spend the next few weeks around current levels. Tony Sycamore, APAC market analyst at Stonex Retail Division, City Index spoke about current BTC charts as well on Tuesday.In another note sent to Bitcoin.com News, Sycamore said he reported in early May that the leading crypto asset was due for “another leg lower (Wave c) towards support at $42,000 where signs of basing will be watched for as an opportunity to buy bitcoin, in anticipation of the uptrend resuming.”“While there is nothing concrete yet in terms of a base at $42,000, it’s encouraging to see the support level highlighted in our previous article well-defended thus far,” Sycamore told Bitcoin.com News. “Not far below, is support from the 200-day moving average at $39,700. Should this support region hold, a daily close above $48,000 would be an initial indication the uptrend has resumed, looking for a retest of the April $64,895 high,” the APAC market analyst added.What do you think about bitcoin prices dropping lower than they are today?

The electric car company has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments citing environmental issues. “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” Tesla wrote.Ark Invest’s analyst Yassine Elmandjra wrote:In our view, the concerns around Bitcoin’s energy consumption are misguided. Contrary to consensus thinking, we believe the impact of bitcoin mining could become a net positive to the environment.The analyst added: “With real-world data, we demonstrate how mining could impact the amount of renewable energy provisioned to the grid by transforming intermittent power resources into baseload generation by way of energy storage.”This is not the first time Ark Invest has tried to explain bitcoin’s energy consumption. The firm recently published a report in collaboration with Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. arguing that “Bitcoin is key to an abundant, clean energy future.” As explained in the report, the analyst detailed:We illustrate that renewables would be able to satisfy only 40% of the grid’s needs in the absence of bitcoin mining but 99% with the commercial ‘subsidies’ associated with bitcoin mining.While Musk and Tesla have voiced their concerns over bitcoin’s environmental impact, both said that they have not sold their BTC despite speculation that Tesla may have so over the weekend.Elmandjra further explained that Tesla’s decision to drop bitcoin as a payment method “seems to have been triggered by private equity firm Greenidge’s plans to revive a coal power plant to mine bitcoin.” He noted that “Elon Musk referenced the announcement in a tweet.”However, the analyst noted:Subsequently, Greenidge clarified not only that its plant is powered by natural gas and feeds the grid but also that it bought carbon credits to offset the emissions.Do you agree with the Ark Invest analyst about bitcoin mining’s impact on the environment?

Bitcoin’s dominance index hasn’t been this low since June 2018.At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency economy is worth roughly $2.06 trillion, as far as the value of all 9,869 digital currencies in existence is concerned. Furthermore, bitcoin’s (BTC) market valuation captures 40% of the entire crypto market capitalization.This measurement is much lower than it has been in a while, as the first week of January saw BTC dominance at 69.7%. Bitcoin’s dominance index has been steadily dropping since then, even after the crypto asset tapped all-time price highs weeks later. The reason for this loss in BTC dominance stems from a number of digital currencies competing for the crypto asset’s market position. In fact, most of the top ten digital currencies in terms of market cap, have gathered a great deal of value against BTC. It is well known that ethereum (ETH) has been eating BTC dominance in recent weeks and ETH’s overall valuation captures 19.15% of the economy’s market valuation on Monday. Ethereum continues to gain on BTC and the U.S. dollar, and some people think ETH’s market cap could flip BTC’s overall market valuation in due time.Besides ETH, three other tokens capture 3-4% of the crypto economy’s market valuation on Monday. This includes BNB, ADA, and DOGE, while bitcoin cash (BCH) down to tether (USDT) commands 1-2% of the crypto economy’s capitalization.The decentralized exchange (dex) Uniswap and its native token UNI holds the tenth market position today and around 0.95% of the entire economy. In fact, the top ten market positions all the way to the fifteenth position all have between .50-0.94% of the whole global crypto capitalization. It is interesting to note, that up until February 26, 2017, bitcoin (BTC) held an above-average dominance level between 84% to 95% since the day the Bitcoin network came to life. Bitcoin’s dominance level dropped significantly after the second month of 2017, and dipped to 37% on June 18, 2017.Bitcoin’s market dominance level also dropped lower than that on January 14, 2018, when it slid to 32%. Hardcore BTC supporters are convinced the coin will never lose the top position, while others believe a ‘flippening’ is inevitable. What do you think about bitcoin’s dominance level dropping to 40% while ethereum’s climbs past 19%? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

948,"Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Still 'Intact' Says Creator, Crypto Fear Index Taps 12-Month Low","May 17, 2021","The leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has dropped 20% in value after Tesla announced on May 12, the electric car firm would not be accepting bitcoin for purchases. Two days later, the creator of the notorious stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) price model, Plan B, shared his model and said the S2FX was still “intact.” Plan B still shows confidence in the bitcoin bull run and expects another 5x in the next six months.Despite the recent crypto market downturn, Plan B still seems positive that the bitcoin bull run is not quite over. “Plan B,” is a pseudonym leveraged by the Twitter account @100trillionusd and also the creator of the popular stock-to-flow (S2F) price model. This particular model leverages a ratio of bitcoin’s scarcity (BTC in circulation) to BTC issuance. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin network’s inflation rate per annum is approximately 1.77% and will continue to drop lower as time passes.Plan B first published his paper called “Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity” on March 22, 2019. The stock-to-flow model or S2F, quantifies scarcity similar to assets like gold and silver. It takes the BTC in circulation and divides it by the annual issuance rate. When Plan B published that paper, bitcoin (BTC) had a market capitalization of $70 billion and today, the market valuation is $844 billion. Moreover, Plan B has updated the S2F model and now calls it the “BTC S2F cross-asset (S2FX) model.”“S2FX model enables valuation of different assets like silver, gold and BTC with one formula,” Plan B S2FX description explains.The day after Tesla announced it was not accepting BTC for purchases, Plan B took to Twitter sharing an S2FX chart and said: “S2FX intact … this is starting to look like 2013 bull market.” The following day Plan B shared another chart and gave his 467,000 Twitter followers another S2FX update:Net result (after Turkey ban, US tax FUD, Faketoshi law suits, Elon/Tesla energy FUD) is that bitcoin is 5x higher than ~6 months ago. And both S2FX model + onchain data indicate that we are only halfway this bull market. I would not be surprised to see another 5x next ~6 months.Furthermore, on May 17, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index (CFGI) shows a score of 27 pointing to “fear” and sentiment is the same as it was over a year ago today.The index, a metric that “analyzes the emotions and sentiments from different sources and crunches them into one simple number,” reached this same region on April 28, 2020. 30 days ago, CFGI data shows that the sentiment analysis was “extreme greed” or a score of 76. Seven-day statistics show that the CFGI score was 72 or “greed.”On Saturday, Plan B discussed bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and his thoughts on the next few months. The technical analysis tool dubbed the “Relative Strength Index” (RSI) is essentially a momentum indicator that can help analysts define oversold or overbought conditions in a market.“Bitcoin relative strength index (RSI),” Plan B said sharing another chart. “We are at the typical mid-bull-cycle drop in RSI (yellow circles), in between 2013 and 2017. Excited about [the] next couple of months,” Plan B added.What do you think about Plan B’s current market assessment? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

949,Elon Musk Discloses 'Tesla Has Not Sold Any Bitcoin',"May 17, 2021","Amid speculation over the weekend that Tesla may have sold its bitcoins, CEO Elon Musk has clarified that the electric car company “has not sold any bitcoin.” The Technoking of Tesla got into a heated debate with the bitcoin community Sunday after he announced that Tesla has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments due to environmental concerns.Tesla CEO Elon Musk got into a string of heated discussions with bitcoiners on Sunday which led to speculation that Musk’s electric car company may have sold its bitcoins or is planning to sell them shortly. The discussions started after Musk announced that Tesla has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments due to environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin plummeted.To end speculation, Musk confirmed early Monday morning that Tesla has not dumped its bitcoins. He wrote: “To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any bitcoin.”This clarification concurred with the statement made by Tesla when it announced that it has suspended accepting bitcoin as a means of payment. The company wrote: “Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Tesla cited environmental issues as the reason. The company began accepting bitcoin for payments in late March.The speculation that Tesla may have sold its bitcoins started when Musk replied to a tweet by Twitter handle @cryptowhale which states: “Bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their bitcoin holdings. With the amount of hate Elon Musk is getting, I wouldn’t blame him.” Musk then replied: “Indeed.”Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in the first quarter as disclosed in the company’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the end of April, the company’s bitcoin stash was worth $2.5 billion. Musk confirmed on Twitter at the time: “I have not sold any of my bitcoin,” adding that “Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.”Do you think Tesla will sell its bitcoins?

950,"Banking System Uses Significantly More Energy Than Bitcoin, Research Shows","May 16, 2021","A new report shows that the banking system consumes more than twice the amount of energy that bitcoin does. The authors analyzed bitcoin’s energy usage and compared it to the banking and gold industries.Galaxy Digital published a report last week entitled “On Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption: A Quantitative Approach to a Subjective Question.” The authors described, “This report took a quantitative approach, comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to that of other industries.”Within the report was an energy consumption comparison between the banking system, gold, and bitcoin.According to the report, the Bitcoin network consumes an estimated 113.89 TWh/yr in total. The estimate comprises miner demand, miner electricity consumption, pool electricity consumption, and node electricity consumption.While the report estimates that the gold industry utilizes roughly 240.61 TWh/yr, it says that the banking system consumes the most energy.The authors noted that “The four key areas of electricity consumption associated within the broader banking system with enough data to establish acceptable estimates are banking data centers, bank branches, ATMs, and card network’s data centers.” They wrote:We estimate the banking system uses 263.72 TWh of energy each year.In conclusion, the report highlights bitcoin’s features that can offer financial freedom to people worldwide. Moreover, “The network can benefit the energy sector by creating perfect use cases for intermittent and excess energy. And the network will only scale further if network adoption warrants it.”Emphasizing that “Energy utilization is not necessarily a bad thing,” the authors noted that “Humans will continue to find new technologies that require more energy that challenge the status quo. Bitcoin is yet another example.” They then revisited the original question:Is the Bitcoin network’s electricity consumption an acceptable use of energy? Our answer is definitive: yes.What do you think about this research? Let us know in the comments section below.

951,Mark Cuban to Elon Musk: Accepting Bitcoin Will Actually Benefit the Environment,"May 16, 2021","Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has made an argument that accepting cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, will actually help the environment. He told Elon Musk, whose electric car company Tesla has suspended accepting bitcoin, citing environmental problems.Billionaire entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban has a message for Elon Musk after the Tesla CEO announced that his electric car company has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments. Cuban tweeted Wednesday:We at Mavs.com will continue to accept BTC/ETH/DOGE because we know that replacing gold as a store of value will help the environment.Tesla cited environmental issues as the reason for the suspension of bitcoin payment acceptance. “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” Tesla wrote.In his tweet to Musk, Cuban cited an article by The New York Times published back in 2005 that shed light on the gold mining industry based on the publication’s months-long examination, including tours of gold mines in the American West, Latin America, Africa, and Europe.“Some metal mines, including gold mines, have become the near-equivalent of nuclear waste dumps that must be tended in perpetuity. Hard-rock mining generates more toxic waste than any other industry in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency estimated last year that the cost of cleaning up metal mines could reach $54 billion,” the article details.Another article Cuban referred to was published by Moneyweek in January this year entitled “Bitcoin does consume a lot of energy — but here’s why it’s worth it.” The article points out that much of the energy bitcoin mining consumers is renewable, noting that half of the global bitcoin mining takes place in Sichuan, China, because of hydroelectricity.“Roughly 5% of Sichuan bitcoin mining power comes from nuclear or burning coal. 95% is from renewables,” the article says. Moreover, Coinshares’ research found that the Bitcoin network obtains 74% of its electricity from renewable sources.In conclusion, Cuban further told Musk:Shrinking big bank and coin usage will benefit society and the environment.Do you agree with Mark Cuban or Elon Muk?

952,Norwegian Billionaire: Bitcoin Becoming Mainstream Is Inevitable — Elon Musk's Comments 'Haven’t Changed Anything',"May 16, 2021","Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke says bitcoin becoming mainstream is inevitable. Unlike Tesla, which stopped accepting cryptocurrency, Rokke’s company is now considering accepting bitcoin as a means of payment, emphasizing that Elon Musk’s comments about the cryptocurrency’s environmental issues have not changed anything.Norwegian oil billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke believes that bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars. He owns almost 70% of the industrial investment company Aker ASA, which owns oil producer Aker BP that recently branched out into green technology and renewable energy.Rokke’s enthusiasm for bitcoin has made an impact on Aker, which now says it is open to the idea of accepting payments in BTC, Bloomberg reported Saturday. “We’re curious about this technology,” Aker CEO Oyvind Eriksen was quoted as saying.He explained that the payment system has not been configured to accept cryptocurrency yet, but noted that “things happen very quickly here.” In addition, Eriksen emphasized that he is “no stranger” to the idea of receiving payments in bitcoin.Aker’s comment followed the announcement by Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments. “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” Tesla said.In response to comments by Tesla and Musk about bitcoin’s environmental issues, Aker affirmed that Musk’s latest comments “haven’t changed anything.”In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Rokke said that bitcoin’s entry into the mainstream economy is inevitable. Despite the cryptocurrency’s volatility, he wrote:The question is not if, but when … We have to ex­pect a lot of volatil­i­ty. But we don’t care, because we be­lieve in the long-term functionality.In March, Rokke established a bitcoin investment company called Seetee AS with an initial capital injection of 500 million kroner ($60 million). He explained that Seetee’s liquid assets will be in bitcoin.Rokke’s enthusiasm about bitcoin has also attracted another Norwegian billionaire to the cryptocurrency. Øystein Stray Spetalen said in April that he bought some BTC after he read that “Røkke had gone into bitcoin.” He admitted, “I cannot bear to see that Røkke makes money and not me.”What do you think about Rokke’s bitcoin comments and Aker’s strategy?

953,John Lennon's Son Defends Bitcoin- Musician Highlights Carbon Footprint Tied to Consumerism,"May 16, 2021","Over the course of the last week, the concern tied to the environmental impact bitcoin mining produces continues to be a very topical discussion. On May 14, the musician and activist, Sean Ono Lennon, the son of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, said that he’s more concerned with consumerism than those complaining about bitcoin’s use of electricity. Sean Ono Lennon, the son of the Beatles’ John Lennon, is a fan of the leading digital currency bitcoin (BTC). Back in November 2020, Lennon discussed the subject on the “Orange Pill” podcast with hosts Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. During the interview, Lennon told the “Orange Pill” podcast hosts that he felt like “bitcoin is something that empowers individuals.” The British-American musician further added that bitcoin “empowers people in a way they’ve never been empowered before.”This week on Twitter, Lennon has made another statement about bitcoin, after the recent Elon Musk and Tesla controversy that sparked concerns over the network’s carbon footprint. It seems that Lennon understands that bitcoin miners use a great deal of renewable energy and the musician thinks there are bigger issues humans should consider. On Friday Lennon tweeted:Ppl wearing jeans and drinking coffee and eating almonds and avocados and driving cars and taking flights and using cellphones and buying new computers while complaining that #bitcoin uses electricity (70% of which is renewable).Lennon’s bitcoin tweet, which criticized the very fabric of mindless consumerism, was quite popular receiving thousands of likes and retweets. Some individuals replied to Lennon and discussed how humans eat a lot of meat, as they believe this causes quite a bit of greenhouse gases that could be curbed. Some people attacked bitcoin and one person called the cryptocurrency a “pyramid scheme.” Lennon responded to the pyramid scheme commentary and said:Ppl tend to completely misuse the terms Ponzi and pyramid scheme. #bitcoin has none of these features, not even vaguely.Some individuals in Lennon’s Twitter thread also mentioned the ‘proof-of-violence’ that backs the petro-dollar. “You missed the most obvious one – Using the petro-dollar every day of their life. Backed by the biggest polluter in the world,” the individual said, referring to the U.S. military as the world’s biggest polluter.A few other individuals responding to Lennon’s statement about bitcoin said it wasn’t about the environment and more about control. “Let’s be honest, it has nothing to do with their concern for the planet. They don’t like it as they have no control of crypto,” the person said to Sean Ono Lennon on Twitter.Sean Ono Lennon also sports a bitcoin hashtag on his Twitter bio and following his tweet about consumerism being a bigger problem, Lennon made another carbon footprint remark.“Newsflash: rocket fuel has a pretty big carbon footprint. Just saying…,” Lennon tweeted the next day.Do you agree with Sean Ono Lennon’s views about bitcoin and the environment? Let us know in the comments section below.

954,Bitcoin Cash Upgrades Successfully: Network Works as Intended,"May 16, 2021","On May 15, the Bitcoin Cash upgrade was applied successfully to the blockchain, bringing a slew of features directed toward improving the overall experience of users. This particular upgrade marks the start of a new upgrade schedule that will allow developers to invest more time in testing new features added to the protocol in the future.The latest Bitcoin Cash update, which proposed a set of important changes, was applied successfully to the network Saturday afternoon. This specific upgrade provided improvements that would tackle user experience and offer better security against double-spending.The new features were applied to the chain with no problem, and at the time of writing, 82 blocks have been mined with the new rules, according to Coin Dance. This update marks a new era in how developers manage protocol updates, contrasting with how things were done before.It brings two new proposals that seek to standardize and improve protocol development: A new yearly update schedule, that will help developers to write and test new features more thoroughly, and CHIPs (Cash Improvements Proposals), whose objective is to present these features to users and miners before being applied.Additionally, the removal of the unconfirmed chained transaction limit has been applied and users have been testing the feature in the wild.Bitcoin Cash has had a convoluted story when applying updates. Just last year, the network faced a contentious hard fork when the most dominant node’s developers, Bitcoin ABC, proposed a new ruleset.This ruleset changed how mining rewards were distributed, giving Bitcoin ABC a percentage of them. A majority of the community including alternative node software teams decided to let the ABC development team fork away. Bitcoin Cash retained its ticker and the hashrate majority at that time, and the Bitcoin ABC separated entirely, creating its own chain.But even before that, Bitcoin Cash faced another contentious hard fork that pitted Bitcoin ABC’s lead dev Amaury Sechet against Craig Wright over specific changes. This schism gave birth to bitcoinsv (BSV), through what was called at the time a “hash war,” that faced miners supporting one chain against the miners supporting the other.Developers have now learned from the past mistakes, acknowledging these problems, and are betting for a more off-centered, independent development process with CHIPs at the center of it. CHIPs are now the to-go structure to propose changes, and to find consensus to enable or reject them and avoid now familiar pitfalls that have gone together with centralized development.What do you think about the new Bitcoin Cash Update? Let Us Know In the comments section below.

955,Major Music Festival Exit Takes Bitcoin for Tickets,"May 16, 2021","A popular international music festival, Exit, is now accepting cryptocurrency for tickets, products, and services. This year’s 20th-anniversary edition of the European event will be held in early summer and the festival’s online store already offers discounts for impatient music fans and visitors. Bitcoin, the organizers say, is a fast and secure currency that has dramatically challenged the current norms of finance and governance. That’s why the festival now offers crypto enthusiasts among music fans the option to pay for tickets and passes, airport transfers, camping accommodation, and more using their digital coins. In a press release on the introduction of crypto payments, Exit stated:With the growth of blockchain, digital currency and non-fungible tokens, Exit recognizes that festivals should adapt and embrace new technologies to cater for their audience needs.“The potential of blockchain, digital exchange, and currency is exciting and we wanted to make sure we are at the forefront, utilizing new technologies and able to engage with our tech-savvy audience as technology evolves and changes,” Exit CEO Dušan Kovačević was quoted saying. To spend some BTC, customers need to select the items they want to buy in the festival’s store and proceed to checkout, where they’ll be offered the “Pay with Bitcoin” option.Exit is not only among the first music events of this caliber to accept cryptocurrency but also on course to become the first major music festival of the 2021 season in Europe. Its 20th-anniversary edition will be held July 8 – 11 at the Petrovaradin Fortress in Serbia’s second-largest city, Novi Sad. It will feature famous music artists in the region and beyond, creating in various genres including rock, techno, metal, hip hop, and punk, who will perform on 40 different stages.The festival was first held in 2000 when it was organized as a pro-democracy event by the Serbian student movement. It has since grown into a major international summer music festival with numerous awards over the years, including for Best Major Festival at the European Festivals Awards in 2013 and 2017. Exit was also recognized as a Champion of Regional Cooperation by the Regional Cooperation Council of South-Eastern Europe.At least 200,000 people from dozens of countries attended the festival in 2019. Last year, Exit was planning five major events across the region but all of them were canceled due to the spreading coronavirus epidemic. This year, the organizers have expressed confidence that the festival will take place on the scheduled dates. The team is following closely the Covid-19 situation in Europe and is preparing the event in accordance with government guidelines to ensure the health and safety of all visitors and artists.Do you know of other major music festivals selling tickets for cryptocurrency? Tells us in the comments section below.

956,"While Bitcoin Energy Concerns Grow, Nobody Discusses the Carbon and Military Violence Backing US Dollars","May 16, 2021","This week a great number of bitcoin supporters and skeptics have been arguing over whether or not bitcoin mining is harmful to the global environment. However, crypto supporters have been saying that concerns over the Bitcoin network’s energy supply are absurd, in contrast to the carbon used and the military violence that backs a number of fiat currencies including the U.S. dollar. One could even go as far as to say that the American dollar alone has left boot prints on large groups of humans over the years and desecrated entire countries.Elon Musk and his electric car company Tesla ignited a ferocious debate over bitcoin mining and how it affects the global environment. Similarly, the founder of Square and Twitter, Jack Dorsey, added fuel to the argument when his company’s CFO said the payment firm has no current plans to buy more bitcoin (BTC).Dorsey then tweeted that “changes *everything*…for the better” and further added, “we will forever work to make bitcoin better.”However, people have been questioning Musk and Dorsey’s stance, as the two have not discussed the carbon used by the U.S. dollar or the military violence that is tethered to the American currency. Despite the dollar’s obvious problems, Musk and Dorsey’s companies have accepted USD without hesitation.Moreover, Musk himself has been called out over hypocrisy. The popular stock-to-flow creator “Plan B” shared a photo with Musk of a Tesla car using energy that derived from power stemming from a coal facility in North Dakota.It is well known that the U.S. dollar is tied to violence and manipulation that is bolstered by the military-industrial complex. In fact, most people believe the American military occupation abroad and more specifically in the Middle East has been kept there to maintain the U.S. hegemony and petro-dollar.After Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) quite literally flipped the American economy upside down, global financiers invoked the Bretton Woods pact which was the first step in establishing the petro-dollar. These days a great number of economists and analysts have said on multiple occasions that the petro-dollar and the U.S. hegemony is over.People should ask if Musk and Dorsey have contemplated the proof-of-work behind the U.S. dollar and the petro-dollar’s effects on the global economy. It’s well documented that the American dollar’s consensus algorithm is backed by violent measures and sanctions.The U.S. dollar has made it so America has been a bully of other nations and feels the need to step in as the world police. But environmentalists have added zero concerns about the U.S. dollar and they gladly accept USD to fund their goals. The founder of Watchdog Capital, Bruce Fenton tweeted about this hypocrisy on Friday. Fenton said:An M1 Abrams tank uses jet fuel that costs $5 a gallon (3-10x delivered). It burns a gallon a minute when driving, a gallon every 5 min when idle. In Afghanistan, they leave the tanks on all night. The war has been going for two decades. Don’t @ me about Bitcoin energy usage.Fenton’s critique is quite valid, but people like Elon Musk or Jack Dorsey have yet to address such subjects. The U.S. military, which keeps the dollar going strong, depends on massive amounts of fuel and has one of the largest carbon footprints on earth. This fact is well documented and the U.S. military cannot escape the massive amounts of carbon it uses on a daily basis.“U.S. military spending is greater than the total military spending of the next seven countries combined: China, Saudi Arabia, India, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and Germany,” explains data from Street Smart Economics. In fact the “price we pay for militarism” is colossal but the U.S. government sweeps it all under the rug.“This kind of information is readily available,” Street Smart Economics’ author Martin Hart-Landsberg details. “The military’s contribution to global warming is not. One reason is that because of U.S. government pressure, the governments negotiating the 1992 Kyoto Protocol agreed that emissions generated by military activity would not count as national emissions and would not have to be reported. As a consequence, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces one of the world’s most trusted reports on the rate at which climate change is occurring, does not include national military emissions in its calculations.”On June 24, 2019, the website theconversation.com tried to initiate a conversation about U.S. military spending and its carbon footprint. The three authors Benjamin Neimark, Oliver Belcher, and Patrick Bigger show data that indicates “the U.S. military is a bigger polluter than as many as 140 countries.” The researchers’ study highlights how the U.S. military leverages carbon-based fuels more so than any entity in history.“The U.S. military is one of the largest polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries,” The researchers’ study insists. “If the US military were a country, its fuel usage alone would make it the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, sitting between Peru and Portugal.”There is countless evidence that shows the U.S. military is used to bolster the country’s currency and keep it in place as the world reserve currency. Historical records show that the U.S. government’s proof-of-work system for the U.S. dollar was not a fairly distributed peer-to-peer currency system.For 300 years or more now the global elite has manipulated ledgers and created an immoral social and financial ranking system. Elon Musk and the rest of the so-called environmentalists speaking out against the Bitcoin network should really consider what the U.S. dollar has done and what the fiat currency continues to do.Do you think concerns over the Bitcoin network’s energy use are overblown? Do you think people should be discussing the carbon and violence that backs USD? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

957,Square CEO Says 'Bitcoin Changes Everything for the Better',"May 15, 2021","The CEO of Square Inc. says that “bitcoin changes everything for the better.” His comment followed one from Square’s CFO reaffirming the company’s corporate bitcoin strategy. The CEO also made a commitment to “forever work to make bitcoin better.” Meanwhile, Square and Ark Invest have published a report arguing “for bitcoin as a key driver of renewable energy’s future.”Following a comment from Square’s chief financial officer, Amrita Ahuja, stating that the company has not changed its bitcoin strategy, CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Friday: “Bitcoin changes ‘everything’ … for the better. And we will forever work to make bitcoin better.”Dorsey’s statement followed CFO Ahuja’s tweet that says: “Our bitcoin strategy hasn’t changed. We’re deeply committed to this community, including working towards a greener future through our Bitcoin Clean Energy initiative.” She emphasized that “as shared in February, Square continues to access its bitcoin investment strategy on an ongoing basis.”Dorsey then participated in a discussion thread that started with a tweet stating: “Neither Jack, nor Elon, nor anyone else can change Bitcoin. Bitcoin will change Jack, Elon and everyone else.” Another Twitter user asked about institutions, questioning: “Is that the threat that we all are concerned about?”Dorsey responded by saying:No single person (or institution) will be able to change it, or stop it.This week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his electric car company has suspended accepting bitcoin for payments. The company cited environmental issues, stating, “We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.” The price of bitcoin took a hit following Musk’s comment.In April, Square and Ark Invest authored a white paper “to argue for bitcoin as a key driver of renewable energy’s future,” Square explained.In the report, Ark wrote: “With real-world data, we (Ark Invest) demonstrate that bitcoin mining could encourage investment in solar systems (solar grid + batteries), enabling renewables to generate a higher percentage of grid power with potentially no change in the cost of electricity.”What do you think about the Square CEO’s comments about bitcoin?

958,Chinese Police Return Bitcoin to Victim in 3 Million Yuan Theft Case,"May 15, 2021","Police in China’s Jiangxi province have reportedly recovered bitcoins stolen from a victim and returned them to the owner. The case involves the theft of 8.236 bitcoins, worth approximately 3 million yuan.Police in China’s Jiangxi province have reportedly solved a case involving the theft of bitcoins worth almost 3 million yuan ($466,000), local media reported this week.A man, referred to only by his last name Shan, filed a police report stating that he was unable to access his email account linked to his cryptocurrency wallet after someone changed his password. His account contained 8.236 BTC, worth approximately 2.96 million yuan. At the time of writing, this amount of bitcoin is worth $406,949.Preliminary investigations showed that the email account was linked to more than 20 telephone numbers that had been illegally obtained by the suspect to avoid police detection, the authorities say.However, the police eventually located the suspect, who is referred to only by his surname Zeng, from East China’s Jiangsu province through mass data screening and analysis, He was arrested on April 20 in Nanning, South China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.Zeng confessed that he got greedy when the price of bitcoin soared. The publication described that he then conspired with others to trick the victim into giving him the password to the email account allowing him to gain access to the victim’s bitcoin.The police said that Zeng has been put under criminal detention while the case is still pending.What do you think about this bitcoin theft case?

959,"As Bitcoin Drops in Value, Proof-of-Stake Tokens That Use Less Energy See Double-Digit Gains","May 15, 2021","Crypto markets have been very volatile in recent times and a great number of digital assets have dropped more than 30% in value during the last three days. Although, not all the coins in the crypto economy are doing badly, as coins that do not leverage proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms have actually done well after the recent Tesla controversy. Distributed ledgers that use delegated validation nodes and proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains have made double-digit gains in recent days. As soon as Elon Musk and Tesla sparked the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm controversy, a few blockchains that use less energy and alternative consensus algorithms have seen massive gains. For instance, cardano (ADA) tapped an all-time high at $2.37 per unit on Saturday.ADA is up a whopping 4,362% against the U.S. dollar during the last 12 months. Seven-day stats show ADA has gained 40% and more than 18% during the last 24 hours. The Cardano network leverages proof-of-stake and the project is backed by the Ethereum cofounder Charles Hoskinson.Meanwhile, XRP, which also does not use a PoW consensus algorithm, hasn’t gained massive percentages but has remained stable during the downturn. Ripple Labs cofounder Chris Larsen recently explained that BTC would lose its dominance if it didn’t address the energy problems just before Elon Musk stirred the controversy.Polkadot (DOT) is also a proof-of-stake blockchain and it has remained profitable after Musk’s environmental concern statements. The PoS crypto-asset DOT has seen a 40% gain during the last seven days.Stellar (XLM) has done well, polygon (MATIC) is up 25% today, and dogecoin (DOGE) markets held steady because Musk recently said he was working with DOGE developers. The biggest gainers on Saturday include kicktoken (KICK +132%), stakenet (XSN +91%), origin sport (ORS +42%), and peercoin (PPC +40%).In fact, the Peercoin project is the first PoS blockchain to pioneer distributed ledger systems without using massive energy. The token peercoin (PPC) was invoked in 2012 and the website calls it a “green cryptocurrency for a sustainable future.” For years now PPC floundered as an old and mostly forgotten PoS coin but since the recent concerns over PoW, the Peercoin project has made a strong comeback.What do you think about all the PoS coins that are seeing gains because they don’t leverage PoW?

961,Low Energy Proof-of-Work: Bitcoin Improvement Proposal Wants to Change Network's Algorithm,"May 14, 2021","The most topical conversation in the world of cryptocurrencies right now is the effects of bitcoin mining on the global environment after Elon Musk heated up the conversation. Following the recent Tesla announcement, the cofounder of Siphox and Powx, Michael Dubrovsky, revealed the nonprofit Powx has recently submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to produce a “durable, low energy” Bitcoin Proof-of-Work (PoW) system.This week Tesla’s Elon Musk ignited the conversation surrounding bitcoin mining and the effects on the global environment. Musk’s company also said that it was choosing not to accept bitcoin (BTC) for electric car purchases. Following the statements from Tesla, the fintech payments firm Square told the public it would not purchase bitcoin going forward and also cited environmental concerns.Then Musk tweeted that he truly cared about the crypto ecosystem and said: “To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal.” Although, this tweet was followed by responses showing a Tesla car being charged by electricity which obtained power from coal in North Dakota.Meanwhile, a great number of developers, from alternative blockchains that utilize little to no energy to secure and confirm transactions, shilled their projects. Programmers behind proof-of-stake (PoS) projects and other types of blockchains that are less energy-intensive.But after Musk tweeted about his concerns about coal, he also said he was working with the developers behind the Dogecoin network. “Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising,” he said on Friday.On the same day, Michael Dubrovsky cofounder of the nonprofit Powx tweeted that his team submitted a low-energy PoW proposal to the Bitcoin developer’s mailing list.“We (at powx.org) have had a draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal— Durable, Low Energy Bitcoin PoW—for a while now,” Dubrovsky remarked on Twitter. “Looks like the energy issue is finally getting some attention. Bitcoin can be made compatible [with] low-energy optical compute,” the Powx cofounder added.Bitcoin.com News has reported on the Powx project before, back when Michael Dubrovsky, Marshall Ball, and Bogdan Penkovsky published a paper that described a “novel PoW algorithm.” The researcher’s paper details how the algorithm dubbed “Optical Proof-of-Work (OPOW)” could annihilate energy dependency by leveraging photonics. The project’s website says Powx is a nonprofit “dedicated to developing PoW cryptography compatible with ultra-energy-efficient optical computing.” In Powx’s BIP summary the developers’ note:From a practical perspective, bitcoin adoption by companies like Tesla (which recently rescinded its acceptance of bitcoin as payment) has been hampered by its massive energy consumption and perceived environmental impact.The team has developed a cryptographic algorithm called “Heavyhash,” which would take the place of Bitcoin’s SHA256 algorithm. The BIP summary written by Powx further says that the algorithm Heavyhash is compatible with “ultra-energy-efficient photonic co-processors.” The products are specifically developed for machine learning, Powx’s proposal details.“Heavyhash uses a proven digital hash (SHA3) packaged with a large amount of MAC (Multiply-and-Accumulate) computation into a Proof-of-Work puzzle,” the proposal adds. “Although Heavyhash can be computed on any standard digital hardware, it becomes hardware efficient only when a small digital core is combined with a low-power photonic co-processor for performing MAC operations.” Likewise, the OPOW mining rigs would be equipped with a “small digital core flip-chipped onto a large, low-power photonic chip.”The solution Dubrovsky and the Powx team created has been discussed in the past and so far, it hasn’t gained much traction. Further not everyone agreed with Dubrovsky’s recent tweet and one individual said: “Wasting chips is also bad for the environment.” However, Bogdan Penkovsky, a “researcher in brain-inspired/neuromorphic computing,” disagreed with the individual’s wasting chips response.“Accelerating development of low-energy computing can be hardly called a waste,” Penkovsky replied. “This technology has potential to drastically reduce data centers energy use in the future,” the researcher who co-authored the “Optical Proof-of-Work” paper added.What do you think about the Powx project and Michael Dubrovsky’s recent tweet?

962,Bitcoin Mining Operation Greenidge Generation Plans to Be Carbon Neutral Next Month,"May 14, 2021","On Friday, the bitcoin mining operation Greenidge Generation has announced that starting June 1st, the firm will be “carbon neutral” for the rest of 2021 and beyond. Greenidge’s announcement follows the recent statements from Tesla and Square after the companies cited environmental concerns over bitcoin mining.Ever since Tesla cited environmental concerns over bitcoin (BTC) mining and told the public it would not be accepting BTC for electric cars, the topic has spread widely across social media and crypto forums. After Tesla’s announcement, the fintech payments firm Square also told the public it would not make future bitcoin purchases. Now a mining operation based in Dresden, New York has announced that it plans to be “carbon neutral” after June 1, 2021.Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. detailed on Friday that the company will offset all greenhouse gas emissions from BTC mining through a portfolio of fully accredited offset credits this summer.Moreover, Greenidge is exploring alternative green energy sources and other locations across the nation that showcase a strong environmental reputation. Basically, Greenidge aims to buy “voluntary carbon offsets from a portfolio of U.S. greenhouse gas reduction projects.” Further, the New York company says it plans to invest portions of BTC mining profits into renewable energy projects.The company highlights that each reduction project “has been reviewed and certified by one of three well- recognized Offset Project Registries, the American Carbon Registry (ACR), the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) and Verra, ensuring that any projects funded by Greenidge reduce emissions or increase sequestration of greenhouse gas in a manner that is real, permanent, and verifiable.”Jeffrey Kirt, the CEO of Greenidge Generation Holdings believes that the firm is demonstrating the ability to keep BTC mining green.“Our bitcoin mining capability is already best-in-class and seamlessly integrated with our electricity generation that powers thousands of homes and businesses,” Kirt said during the announcement. “By taking the bold and unique step of making our cryptocurrency mining fully carbon neutral immediately – as opposed to at some distant date in the future — Greenidge is once again leading in environmental efforts,” he added.The Greenidge executive continued:We are demonstrating we can provide the same critical transaction verification and processing services to secure the bitcoin network while maintaining a fully carbon neutral footprint. We call on others to join us in significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions now.The company remarked that Greenidge is also participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The RGGI program allows states to engage in CO2 allowances via auctions and renewable energy benefit programs.“The reason our Finger Lakes region loves Greenidge is simple: we are part of the community and we care,” the CEO of Greenidge’s Upstate New York site, Dale Irwin concluded. We have kept our commitment to stop running on coal forever, we operate a clean natural gas plant with modern emissions controls, and we have created a data processing center that offers high-paying tech jobs and spends millions on businesses across our state.”What do you think about Greenidge Generation going carbon neutral by June 2021?

963,"Lawsuit Claims Onecoin's 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova Holds 230,000 Bitcoin","May 14, 2021","One of the ringleaders of the largest crypto Ponzi schemes, Onecoin’s Ruja Ignatova, otherwise known as the “Cryptoqueen,” allegedly owns 230,000 bitcoin worth over $11 billion today. Court documents filed by victims of the Onecoin scheme indicate that she received the bitcoins from a member of an Emirati royal family in Dubai.Onecoin’s Ruja Ignatova is a mysterious woman who has been on the run for over three years now. Ignatova founded Onecoin in concert with Sebastian Greenwood and her brother, Konstantin Ignatov. The Onecoin Ponzi was a multi-level-marketing (MLM) venture that featured packages that were ostensibly tethered to a blockchain network.Ignatova and her cohorts told the public that Onecoin would be the most dominant crypto asset and eventually be a “bitcoin killer.” Due to its organizational structure and fraudulent claims, the crypto community immediately warned people about Onecoin’s operations.Onecoin started on September 16, 2014, and by 2015, Bulgaria’s Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) issued a warning about the project. The Ponzi’s headquarters was Bulgaria-based, however, it was registered as an offshore company in Dubai and its subsidiary Onelife Network was registered in Belize.At the end of 2016, cracks started to show and investigators said the project never used any type of blockchain technology. In 2017, U.S. law enforcement sent a secret warrant for Ignatova’s arrest and the Cryptoqueen disappeared.Sebastian Greenwood was arrested in 2018 and her brother Konstantin Ignatov was arrested in Los Angeles in March 2019. Since then, the founders have been dealing with a few court cases as U.S. prosecutors alleged Onecoin fraudulently took in $4 billion from global participants.Konstantin Ignatov pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering in November 2019 but the Cryptoqueen has never been caught. Now a court filing from victims of the Onecoin scheme shows that Ruja Ignatova may have billions in bitcoin.Reports indicate that the Cryptoqueen may have an account in Dubai worth $500 million but documents also allege that Ruja Ignatova could have obtained 230,000 BTC. The reports claim that she got the $11 billion worth of bitcoins from Sheik Saoud who is the son of one of the wealthiest individuals in Dubai.The exact details of the transactions are unclear but the deal allegedly took place in October 2017 when BTC was trading for around $6k per unit. Behind MLM says that the Cryptoqueen’s alleged relationship with Sheik Saoud “came with perks.”Ruja Ignatova had been able to obtain “Diplomatic credentials” from the Intergovernmental Collaborative Action Fund for Excellence (ICAFE) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Behind MLM’s report stresses “Ignatova was able to travel with impunity.” An article published by financial columnist Rick Steves explains that former real estate agent Mimoun Madani was also involved.“The Ponzi scheme funneled billions to banks and real estate in Dubai where they were allegedly aided by His Excellency Sheikh Saoud bin Faisal Al Qassimi and a former real estate agent Mimoun Madani,” Steves wrote. The reporter also described the transaction between the wealthy individuals based in the UAE who allegedly gave her thousands of bitcoins. The article notes:Sheikh Al Qassimi, in a well-documented and witnessed transaction, handed four hard wallets (USB devices) containing 230,000 Bitcoins then worth about $50 million in exchange for the now frozen [Onecoin] bank accounts, other assets, and real estate in the UAE worth perhaps $1 billion.Behind MLM researchers say that Ignatova’s disappearance has been attributed to a few locations and possibly death. A myriad of reports over the last few years assume Ignatova could be located in the UAE region, Russia or Greece. The researchers further explain that the United Arab Emirates and the United States do not share an extradition treaty.The attorney representing the victims Dr. Jonathan Levy blames the situation on the digital currency ecosystem in general.“Regulators seems oblivious to the fact the cryptocurrency’s main purpose is to facilitate and reward criminals like Ruja Ignatova. It is no coincidence that Ignatova is the main beneficiary of the Bitcoin bubble,” Levy, the plaintiff’s attorney stressed.What do you think about Onecoin’s Ruja Ignatova possibly owning 230,000 bitcoin?

964,Square CFO Says Company Has No Current Plans to Buy More Bitcoin,"May 14, 2021","Square, a fintech and digital payments company, has declared earlier today it doesn’t have plans to purchase more bitcoin in the near future. In an interview, the company’s CFO also referred to the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network and how it is a real issue that needs to be tackled in the future.**Editor’s Note: On Saturday, May 15, 2021, this article’s headline has been updated to better reflect statements made by Square’s CFO Amrita Ahuja. The company’s stance is also mentioned in Amrita Ahuja’s tweet here.Square, one of the most popular fintech payment processors in the industry, has declared it doesn’t plan to buy more bitcoin in the foreseeable future. The declarations were made by Square’s CFO Amrita Ahuja in an interview with Financial News. Ahuja stated:“We don’t have any plans at this point to make further purchases. There are no plans at this point to re-evaluate where we are from a treasury standpoint.”The company, which was one of the first ones to jump into the bitcoin bandwagon, is holding 5% of its cash holdings in Bitcoin. Square, whose CEO is big Bitcoin proponent Jack Dorsey, bought $50 million worth of bitcoin last October, and doubled down on its bet this February, spending $170 million in Bitcoin this time. During its last earnings calls, Square accounted for a bitcoin impairment loss of $20 million on its bitcoin investment during the first quarter of 2021.Ahuja also referred to the environmental concerns that the Bitcoin network has awakened recently. She stated:Our position has always been that this is an area that needs innovation in terms of renewables and clean energy, and we want to be a part of that. There’s a broader supply chain question around how renewables and clean energy become a greater part of the blockchain in general, and a greater part of the overall mining and transaction network…It’s the overall fixed footprint of the network that we need to address.The company outed a research paper last month, showing that Bitcoin could act as a catalyzer for miners to embrace new, cleaner forms of energy in the long run.However, there has been an overall concern for the carbon footprint the Bitcoin network uses to function properly. Bitcoin mining, the process that is key to secure and transact with the Bitcoin blockchain, is an energy-intensive task. This fact has fueled a barrage of critics coming from environmental advocates, who argue there are better equivalents alternatives than Bitcoin.This week, Tesla, the electric automobile company, announced they would stop accepting Bitcoin as payments due to environmental concerns. Its CEO, Elon Musk, also referred to this fact in a tweet, stating he was a big supporter of crypto, but he couldn’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuels like carbon.What do you think about Square not planning to purchase more Bitcoin?

965,Bitcoin Whale Count Shrinks- Speculators Assume Trickle Distribution or Possible Address Reorganizations,"May 14, 2021","The price of bitcoin has seen better days, as the coin’s value hit $59,600 four days ago and then saw the exchange rate tumble to a low of $45,700 per unit on May 12. There have been talks of whales selling coins and data shows that there’s been some large wallet inflows. However, onchain data shows that the whales are either dispersing funds into multiple wallets or bitcoin is being distributed more evenly to smaller fish.While cryptocurrency markets approach the weekend, traders and speculators are wondering what will happen next with these volatile price changes. During the last 48 hours, bitcoin (BTC) and a myriad of other digital currencies have seen massive fluctuations in fiat value.As usual, cryptocurrency participants have been looking at the count of “bitcoin whales,” and have been assuming these large market players have been making massive waves.Most people consider a bitcoin (BTC) whale to be a holder that owns 1,000 bitcoin or more. A summary from bitcoinwiki.org states that a whale owns 1,000 to 5,000 BTC. A “humpback whale” or “mega whale” is classified as a BTC owner with 5,000 coins or more.Now some whales are individuals, and other types of whales are entities like crypto investment funds such as Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust. During the last few days, a few reports have said that the number of BTC whales in the crypto ocean has been dropping considerably.People often speculate on BTC whale action, but crypto market spectators only have a few tools they can use to whale watch. Recent reports have leveraged Glassnode’s “Number of Addresses with Balance ≥ 1k” chart in order to visualize bitcoin whales and watch them closely.Glassnode’s data shows on Wednesday, just over 2,100 whales (addresses holding 1,000 BTC or more) exist, and last year during the same month, 100 more whales existed. This data does not mean whales are selling, as any owner of 1,000 bitcoins in one address can simply split the funds into two addresses or more.Some articles claim that BTC is being distributed more to holders with less bitcoin than massive whales, which suggests that whales are selling. Despite these claims, data suggests that whales are distributing bitcoins but could be whale address reorganizations.For instance, onchain data from whalemap.io shows signs of whale movements in recent days and large wallet inflows in greater detail. Like Glassnode’s stats, data from whalemap.io implies a decline in whales (balance ≥ 1k) and a downward distribution cycle.We also have data stemming from a Bitcoin.com News report published on May 1, 2020. This article also covered the topic of whale counts and noted that whales obtained hundreds of BTC from “small fish.”It is interesting to note, that three addresses have 100,000 to 1 million BTC held in a single address. This number has not changed in May 2021, and there are still three colossal whale addresses with 100k BTC or more. However, “humpback whale” or “mega whale” addressees have dropped in number and there’s not as many this year.Data from the 2020 article and the current “Bitcoin Rich List” published on bitinfocharts.com, indicates whale addresses with 10,000 to 100,000 bitcoins dipped from 106 addresses to 85. Similar to the concept of “trickle-down economics,” data from bitinfocharts.com alludes to whale addresses dispersing bitcoin to addresses with lower quantities of BTC.One could insinuate that whales are distributing coins to “sharks (500 BTC),” “dolphins (100 BTC),” and “fish (50 BTC).” Or the whale addresses could simply be reorganizing into multiple lower quantity addresses that are still maintained by the same owners.What do you think about the bitcoin whale count dropping?

966,The Aspiring Answers to Bitcoin’s Enormous Energy Footprint,"May 14, 2021","Following a tweet from Elon Musk highlighting Tesla’s suspension of bitcoin payment acceptance due to sky-high energy needs, the industry quickly responded by highlighting the capable solutions that already address this drawback.Ever the commentator on all things crypto, Elon Musk took to Twitter on May 13th to explain that Tesla would suspend customer purchases of cars with bitcoin (BTC), pinning the decision on the network’s power consumption as the catalyst.Although he has been one of crypto’s biggest advocates over the last few months, Musk’s latest comments sent bitcoin prices into a tailspin, quickly sparking a steep selloff that has erased nearly 13% of its value over the last 24 hours at the time of writing. Yet, his comments overlook one of the most critical arguments for cryptocurrency’s actual usage: the veritable pantheon of suitable solutions and alternatives that address precisely this point.Despite his energy consumption comments, there are viable solutions already designed to address his point. Although aimed at resolving transaction throughput, the Lightning Network was amongst the first to address the scalability problems of Bitcoin, and since then, others have joined the fray.Among the projects focused on energy consumption is Polygon, which has built an eco-friendly layer 2 solution for Ethereum. In terms of powering the network, the platform’s plasma and sidechains purportedly require several orders of magnitude less power than both Ethereum or Bitcoin, making it a viable answer to Musk’s search for a cryptocurrency that requires less than 1% of the comparable power per transaction.Proof-of-stake (PoS) has emerged as the clear challenger to the proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains that initially dominated the arena. The idea behind PoS is that coin holders stake nodes responsible for validating transactions, reducing the need for the enormous power consumption and computational resources required by existing PoW blockchains.The Twitter hivemind was quick to point this out, and among the respondents was Elrond CEO Beniamin Mincu. Elrond operates on a Secure-Proof-of-Stake (SPoS) blockchain that involves adaptive state sharding to keep the network operating at an optimal level.Tezos, which runs a Liquid-Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) consensus model was also quick to prepare a sharp response to Musk, again highlighting a network with power consumption many orders of magnitude lower than competing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Not to be left out of the conversation, Jelurida CEO Lior Yaffe, the creator of Nxt, the original PoS-based open-source blockchain, opined on the matter, highlighting that the networks he maintains already address the very issue Musk raised. Yaffe explains,As one of the core developers of the first pure PoS coin Nxt, and its multichain spinoff Ardor, I’m happy to see that Elon has finally realized that there is no need to burn fossil fuels in order to maintain a decentralized token of value.So why the sudden focus on Bitcoin’s energy consumption? Perhaps Musk is leveraging his enormous platform to catalyze meaningful change and raise the bar. Moreover, his use of the word “suspended” possibly indicates that he isn’t letting go of the idea of Bitcoin altogether but rather pushing for a more desirable outcome.However, for all his posturing on the lack of Bitcoin’s green-ness, Musk should take heed of the fact that Tesla doesn’t always reach the bar he set for Bitcoin. Consider for one that most Tesla’s are still powered by fossil fuels underpinning the grid. And don’t get us started on the pollution caused by lithium batteries. To counter his point even further, data compiled by Coinshares estimates that renewable sources generated nearly 74.1% of the energy used to mine Bitcoin.What’s most surprising is that given Musk’s resources and stature, why isn’t he more familiar with the existing innovations already advancing significant changes in the blockchain universe?What do you think is Musk’s play here? Does he have an ulterior motive? Let us know in the comments section below.

967,While Bitcoin's Price Slumps the Network's Mining Difficulty Reaches a Lifetime High,"May 13, 2021","After bitcoin prices took a hit following Tesla’s recent u-turn, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty jumped over 25 trillion, the highest the metric has seen during the protocol’s lifetime. The mining difficulty spike follows the recent 12% difficulty drop the network experienced two weeks ago. After some issues with the Xinjiang grid in China three weeks ago, the overall SHA256 hashrate used by the Bitcoin (BTC) network dropped considerably. This in turn caused the BTC network’s mining difficulty to drop 12.6% when the hashrate lowered.Essentially, BTC’s mining difficulty is the measurement of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. The more hashpower there is, then the more the difficulty increases, and when the hashrate lowers, the difficulty drops as well. The difficulty system Satoshi Nakamoto crafted is meant to keep equilibrium within the mining system and fairly consistent 10-minute block intervals.On Wednesday, BTC’s mining difficulty jumped to 25.05 trillion and this metric is the highest the difficulty has ever been. This means it is harder than ever before to find a Bitcoin block and reap the coinbase rewards and fees.BTC’s hashrate has been chugging along much higher since the issues in China and on May 9, 2021, it tapped 214 exahash per second (EH/s). However, since the difficulty increased and the price dropped from Tesla’s announcement, hashrate has also dropped.At the time of writing, the Bitcoin network hashrate is around 170 to 180 exahash per second according to daily onchain statistics. Further, in 13 days if the hashrate was to remain at current levels, another increase could happen. BTC’s network difficulty could jump to 30.30 trillion in less than two weeks’ time.Still, at current BTC prices and with the 25.05 trillion difficulty jump, most ASIC mining rigs are still profitable at $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). A 100 terahash ASIC mining rig still can get between $30 to $40 per day, with current difficulty metrics and $0.12 per kWh.On May 13, 2021, there are approximately 18 mining pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain. Interestingly, for months on end, F2pool was the top mining operation with the most hashrate, but Antpool has recently taken the lead.Poolin follows Antpool at the time of writing and F2pool is now the third-largest mining pool on Thursday afternoon. Bitcoin proponents and investors will be watching the hashrate and mining difficulty very closely, as many believe that the hashrate follows BTC’s price and vice versa.What do you think about the recent mining difficulty spike on Wednesday? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Bitcoin.com Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of STC, being available to trade on the 13th May 2021 at 10:00AM UTC. STC was created by the Student Coin team, as the reference currency for all tokens created on its terminal. STC will start trading with USDT, BTC and ETH pairs.What is Student Coin? The aim of the project is to put the tokens and blockchain into the mainstream. Student Coin is the first platform that allows to perform the wide-scale tokenization for people, organizations, corporations, startups and decentralized finances (DeFi). Wide-scale tokenization is a process that needs an easy-to-use and universal ecosystem that is constructed by the Student Coin. With the STC ecosystem, everyone will be able to easily create any kind of token and develop it in the long run. Student Coin will allow for tokenizing people, firms and organizations, as well as, manage token utilities, perform crowdfunding and easily list new projects.University is an environment for innovation, new technology research, and the source of great ideas. Moreover, universities around the world are now more connected than ever before and have a lot of external value transfers. Finally, the global educational market is one of the fastest-growing sectors, creating a great environment to build disruptive blockchain-based solutions such as the Student Coin. These three factors made universities a perfect place to create the first wide-scale tokenization platform, similar to how the Internet and social media began.Student Coin is run by students, faculties, and entrepreneurs from over 20 universities, including the Kozminski University, New York University, and Harvard University. The global educational market is one of the fastest-growing sectors, creating a great environment to build the first wide-scale tokenization platform, similar to how the Internet and social media began.What is the STC token?The blockchain-based Student Coin ecosystem has its own currency – STC Token. The utility and the usage of the STC Token are corresponding to the amenities of blockchain technology and tokenization. STC works as a reference currency for the equity flow in the whole ecosystem, powering the STC Terminal usage, STC Exchange trading and STC App applications.The key role of the STC Token is being the reference currency for all of the tokens ever created at STC Terminal, the personal, DeFi and startup tokens will be traded at STC Exchange only to STC, making it the measure of the worth.

970,"Bitcoin Markets Blood Red After Tesla Announcement, Crypto Economy Sheds Billions","May 13, 2021","Digital currency markets have seen better days, as billions of dollars were shaved off the entire crypto-economy after Tesla revealed it would not be accepting bitcoin over environmental concerns. The entire market capitalization of all the crypto assets in existence has dipped under the $2 trillion mark, and most coins are down between 5-30% during the last 24 hours.Bitcoin (BTC) and a large swathe of other digital assets have been under selling pressure ever since the Tesla announcement. The original announcement that took place a few weeks ago, when Tesla said it would accept BTC for payments, initially pushed the price up. The reconsideration and decision to stop accepting BTC over environmental concerns caused prices to slide. On Wednesday evening, bitcoin dropped to a low of $45,700 per unit but quickly regained some of the losses.At the time of writing, BTC is exchanging hands for $49,722 per coin and is down close to 12% today. Seven-day stats show bitcoin is down 10% but monthly data shows BTC is still up a touch over 5%.The second-largest market held by ethereum (ETH) is also down over 12% today and but is up 104% during the last 30 days. The two coins’ market caps are more than 60% of the entire crypto-economy with BTC holding 42% dominance and ETH capturing 19.6%.The biggest gainers today include hydro (HYDRO), sai (SAI), and bnktothefuture (BFT). Thursday’s biggest losers include tokens like agrello (DLT), latoken (LA), and ripio (RCN). Currently the entire market cap of all the coins in existence is $1.99 trillion down 8% over the last day. The crypto economy currently has $233 billion in global trade volume and the economy’s stablecoins are getting lots of demand.During the course of the evening on Wednesday and into Thursday, a great number of executives wrote to Bitcoin.com News and made statements about Tesla’s recent decision. Stephen Kelso, the head of markets and crypto expert at ITI Capital explained that the decision had a significant impact.“Elon Musk has had a significant impact on bitcoin once again, but this time by causing its price valuation to plummet,” Kelso wrote. “This will inevitably lead to some short-term cold feet from the retail investors who were influenced to adopt bitcoin at the behest of Elon Musk’s initial appraisal of the cryptocurrency in the first place. However institutional investors better understand the relevance of time frames when looking at the correlations and covariances within multi-asset portfolios.”In another note sent to Bitcoin.com News, London-based fintech investor and VP Capital founder Viktor Prokopenya also discussed the Tesla situation. “Tesla’s value has increased more than all the automotive companies in the world, and its founder Elon Musk is now the richest man on earth,” Prokopenya said. “Cryptocurrencies have emissions now; but in the future – when things will move to proof of stake – then it will have zero emissions. It is true that many cryptocurrencies are at the moment based on ‘proof of work’ or mining, and are not using energy very effectively,” Prokopenya added.The VP Capital founder continued:However, this will change. One hundred years ago, people made the first car. Those cars had very big carbon emissions, but that did not mean we stopped creating cars – we improved the technology. Society has now created a zero-emissions car, and we are moving towards a world where all cars will be clean. Another analyst, Etoro’s Simon Peters, gave Bitcoin.com News some more perspective. “Bitcoin, ethereum, and other crypto assets are entering correction territory now, having dropped more than 20% from peak in most cases,” Peters said. “The sell-off is being driven by a number of factors; valuations were at or near all-time highs earlier this month, so there will naturally be some profit-taking, while we are also seeing a general sell-off among risk assets – such as technology stocks – as economies start to unlock post the pandemic and investors fret over potential rate rises and higher inflation.”Peters added:However, for many crypto assets such as bitcoin and ethereum, the long-term story has not changed. This emerging asset class continues to revolutionise many aspects of financial services, and while nothing goes up in a straight line, the long-term fundamentals for crypto assets remain as solid as ever.Overall most are confident that markets will rebound and over the long term cryptocurrencies, in general, will be fine. Elon Musk has become an enigma in crypto circles and there are those that love him and there are those that dislike him a great deal. Crypto community members were pleased, however, that Tesla plans to keep its BTC reserves.What do you think about all the market action after Tesla’s announcement?

He said that crypto is a solution to the lack of trust in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell “and the rest of the world’s central bankers.” The billionaire investor further said that it will be very difficult to unseat bitcoin as a store of value.Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller talked about the U.S. economy, bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in an interview with CNBC Tuesday. He said that he has “no doubt, none whatsoever, that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”Druckenmiller founded Duquesne Capital in 1981. He managed money for George Soros as the lead portfolio manager for the Quantum Fund until 2000. He and Soros made massive profits betting against the British pound in 1992.He explained that the Fed’s policies and heavy debts and deficits will threaten the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” he described, adding:If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it.He also mentioned that five or six years ago, he said that “crypto was a solution in search of a problem.” He emphasized: “The problem has been clearly identified. It is Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers. There is a lack of trust.”Druckenmiller explained that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford.” However, he conceded, “I don’t know what it will be.”When asked specifically about bitcoin, Druckenmiller first noted that “I’m a 68-year-old dinosaur.” Noting that “Ethereum has the lead in terms of smart contracts, in terms of commerce,” he then opined:It’s going to be very hard to unseat bitcoin as a store of value assetIn conclusion, he clarified that it is too early to know which currency will replace the dollar, but reiterated that “It will be tough to unseat bitcoin.”What do you think about Stan Druckenmiller’s comments about the USD and bitcoin?

972,Bitcoin Cash Argentina Runs Flipstarter to Boost Adoption in the Country,"May 12, 2021","Bitcoin Cash Argentina, a nonprofit organization whose objective is to promote the use of Bitcoin Cash, has started a flipstarter campaign that seeks to raise funds to explain the use cases of this cryptocurrency in the country and boost its adoption. Argentina’s economy has been severely affected by inflation and devaluation, the reason why interest in cryptocurrencies and how these can be used is growing fast.Bitcoin Cash Argentina, an organization that deals with promoting the use and adoption of the said cryptocurrency in the country, is now raising funds to further increase their reach and boost adoption through a series of activities. The fundraising is being conducted through Flipstarter, a BCH-specific tool that allows anyone to collect funds for a determined objective. The funds won’t be released until a certain goal is reached.While Bitcoin Cash Argentina started just six months ago, it has managed to grow as a team capable of organizing meetups and onboarding merchants, growing the Bitcoin Cash user base significantly. According to its Flipstarter PR statement, the team was keen on doing this to show the community what they could do, to fundraise then with a proven record.And it managed to do so. Bitcoin Cash Argentina’s first goal proposed to onboard 50 merchants in the country with self-provided funds. This goal was partially met, with 45 merchants onboarded between March and May. The team also hosts monthly meetups where they explain how Bitcoin Cash works to new users and the benefits of using it on a daily basis.If its campaign succeeds, BCH Argentina plans to ramp up its activities, expanding its first phase goal to reach 100 merchants onboarded. Part of these funds would be donated to users who would have the experience of spending them on local merchants. This would encourage the creation of a circular economy.The campaign has been well received by the community, reaching more than 80% of the goal with 12 days still left to be completed. Key members of the community like Roger Ver and Marc De Mesel have already chipped in substantially, adding to the legitimacy of the project.Argentina is a country that’s relatively new to the cryptocurrency scene. Interest in cryptocurrencies started booming just recently, due to the economic hardships the country has faced. The currency exchange control was one of the main reasons for Argentinians to seek an alternative to the U.S dollar. Citizens accustomed to changing their wages and savings to dollars were now unable to do so due to these controls.Now, hit with Covid-19 related problems, and fighting inflation rates of 50% annually, Argentina is a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption. Key exchanges like Ripio and Bitso have reached record levels of users, and this trend is unlikely to change in the short term.What do you think about Bitcoin Cash Argentina’s flipstarter campaign?

The company cited concerns “about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter Wednesday that his electric car company has suspended accepting bitcoin for vehicle purchases. The message reads:Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.The notice continues: “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the Environment.

Musk has also changed his official title from CEO to Technoking of Tesla.

975,"Ethereum Options Trade Volume Exceeds Bitcoin's, Deribit Introduces a $50K ETH Strike for 2022","May 12, 2021","Last week, ethereum options volume surpassed bitcoin’s for the first time on the digital currency derivatives exchange Deribit. Further, the trading platform recently introduced a $50k ETH strike for March 2022 and explained the $50k call is “gaining immediate buy traction.”When it comes to bitcoin (BTC) derivatives, the trading platform Deribit captures the lion’s share of today’s options volume. The cryptocurrency exchange also features bitcoin futures and ethereum options as well. During the first week of May, Deribit’s ethereum (ETH) options surpassed bitcoin (BTC) options for the first time.Skew analytics data shows while BTC had $880 million on May 3, ETH options saw $1.3 billion. The volume continued that week as the analytics company Skew tweeted about the staggering ETH options volume last Thursday.“Ether markets seeing record activity this week across spot, futures and options,” the analytics firm tweeted. “Options traders’ anticipations of ether volatility relative to bitcoin are rising,” Skew added the next day.On May 10, the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit said: “ETH Option flows now dominating BTC. And not just Fast money.” During the last six months, Deribit has captured the largest number of BTC and ETH options in terms of volume and open interest.“Action across maturities, with Deribit listing the ETH Mar22 50k Call (really!), gaining immediate buy traction. In general, Calls rolled up to keep/add exposure; decent 2-way Put action, but few reducing upside,” Deribit added.Since ethereum has recently obtained all-time price highs on spot markets, traders and speculators have been focused on the top two leading crypto assets’ dominance levels.The leading digital asset bitcoin (BTC) has 42.1% dominance in terms of market cap compared to the entire crypto economy ($2.29T). Ethereum on the other hand has a dominance level of roughly 19.8% at the time of writing.“The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalisation has been moving in a sharp upwards trajectory since its latest hard fork as it continues to prove its use-case,” Simon Peters, the crypto asset analyst at the multi-asset investment platform Etoro wrote to Bitcoin.com News.“The number of decentralised applications continues to grow on the platform. Demand from institutional investors is fuelling this latest move higher as large-scale buyers diversify their exposure in this emerging asset class, with ethereum the natural next pick,” Peters added.In another tweet on May 11, Skew analytics mentioned ethereum (ETH) was seeing large “open interest build up on $5k strike.” Deribit further explained in its Twitter thread that ethereum term structure is in backwardation and BTC in contango.“BTC term structure is in contango. We would expect this from relative RV movement. But BTC IV is nudging higher in sympathy with ETH, on low volumes. Either expectation is of BTC move, or perhaps a shift of MM collateral to the action,” the exchange noted.What do you think about the $50k ethereum options strike?

976,SEC to Scrutinize Funds Invested in Bitcoin Futures,"May 12, 2021","The U.S. securities watchdog has announced it will scrutinize mutual funds that include investments in bitcoin futures markets to verify funds that comply with the Investment Company Act. The institution warned about the dangers of investing in bitcoin futures markets due to the implicit volatility of the underlying asset.Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a public statement titled “Staff Statement on Funds Registered Under the Investment Company Act Investing in the Bitcoin Futures Market,” where the institution announced they would ramp up vigilance for funds that have invested in Bitcoin Futures Markets as part of their speculative strategies to maximize profit. The Division of Investment Management, a section of the SEC that oversees mutual funds and other investment products, would be the institution in charge of watching the behavior of these funds.The public statement also warns these funds about the implicit volatility of bitcoin, and consequently, about the volatility of bitcoin futures markets. The statement argues that:Investors should consider the volatility of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin futures market, as well as the lack of regulation and potential for fraud or manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market.The statement highlights the lack of protection and price manipulation from third parties that the underlying asset can experience, affecting said markets.The Division of Investment Management announced it would be vigilant on several issues, including analyzing the liquidity of the market to verify if it has the liquidity to sustain these funds. Alongside this, monitoring the impact of these funds on the price of bitcoin, and analyzing the possibility of fraud or manipulation affecting these investment structures.The statement mentions it will assess through thorough investigation if the market can support the launch of a Bitcoin ETF. The SEC stressed that they would:Consider whether, in light of the experience of mutual funds investing in the Bitcoin futures market, the Bitcoin futures market could accommodate ETFs, which, unlike mutual funds, cannot prevent additional investor assets from coming into the ETF if the ETF becomes too large or dominant in the marketSeveral proposals for approval of a bitcoin ETF have been filed and rejected by the SEC during the last few years, with its former Chairman Jay Clayton being considered as a bitcoin skeptic in crypto spheres. However, now that Clayton has abandoned his position in the institution, it seems that at least they are considering it.This year, a plethora of bitcoin ETF applications have been filed, as a result of the rising interest for bitcoin due to the bull market, and even an ethereum ETF has been proposed. However, the tone in which this statement is written is not too optimistic, which might mean it could take some more time before a cryptocurrency-based ETF gets approved in the United States.What do you think about the SEC scrutinizing funds invested in Bitcoin Futures?

Further, like a variety of corporate entities that are accepting and holding bitcoin, Palantir is considering keeping the asset on its balance sheet. On Tuesday, Palantir Technologies announced the firm would accept bitcoin as payment from customers, according to a report published by Reuters. The report followed Palantir’s earnings statements from Q1, and claims Palantir is considering holding the bitcoin it earns.The business is backed by the investor Peter Thiel, who cofounded the company in 2003 and was the largest shareholder until 2014. The company’s name stems from the Lord of the Rings series, in an acknowledgment of the book’s “seeing-stones” called “palantíri.” Palantir’s software and data analytics have been integral to the firm’s two largest clients, the United States Department of Defense and the United States Intelligence Community (USIC).The company released its first-quarter earnings, with a reported a 49% revenue growth in Q1. Palantir said it is expecting a further “$360 million in revenue” in Q2, which is above the estimate given by a recent Refinitiv survey. Thiel has been an advocate for digital assets for some time, claiming in 2018 that he was “long bitcoin” and that he believed institutional investors would eventually jump into the crypto economy. The same year, the Paypal cofounder stressed that bitcoin was a “deeply contrarian” investment. In recent times, Thiel alluded to China using bitcoin (BTC) as a financial weapon against the United States. When speaking about the U.S. in terms of blockchain innovation Thiel said: My guess is we will not be the leader in this forefront, where an authoritarian regime like China sees nearly all upside from having the capacity to issue currency or take away currency.Palantir’s bitcoin acceptance was welcomed by crypto advocates on social media, and discussions about the company’s holding have started trending. “I feel like it’s only good for the business, no matter what the motive is,” said one of the many commentators.What do you think about the announcement that Palantir will accept bitcoin as payment from customers and possibly holding the crypto asset?

This was seemingly an innocent announcement that, nonetheless, got the crypto sphere talking on what deeper meaning this might indicate. While some have rationalized this as being an endorsement of Bitcoin by Facebook, others have suggested weirder theories.Zuckerberg revealed yesterday on Facebook that one of his goats is named “Bitcoin”. This post, which would usually read as humorous, got the cryptocurrency sphere to formulate strange theories. While some users laughed and spread their memes accordingly, some thought there could be greater intention behind the post.Some users took this as a hint that Facebook had or will follow the footsteps of companies like Tesla and Microstrategy, by buying Bitcoin as a hedge and adding it to its cash reserves. There were rumors about this last month, but Facebook squashed them during their last earnings call, denying having bought bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.According to a tale from Jack Dorsey, Zuckerberg’s goats have not just been pets, but food. He described how Zuckerberg would personally kill them, immobilizing the animal with a stun gun and then using a knife. Lots of users recalled this macabre incident, jokingly stated Zuckerberg could kill Bitcoin anytime if he really wanted to.Jokes aside, Facebook inroads into cryptocurrency have not been particularly successful. In effort to create its own cryptocurrency, first called Libra and later rebranded to Diem, the company has met opposition from the global regulatory community. They claim a unique Facebook crypto would give the social media giant too much power.Launched with the support of large backers, Libra’s proposal lost steam. It was abandoned by some of its most significant supporters, such as Visa, MasterCard, and eBay, then changing its proposal to become a basket of stablecoins. This was to appease the worries of domestic and international lawmakers.Zuckerberg was even summoned to the Congress to explain the ins and outs of its proposal. He received a severe reaction from lawmakers, like House Financial Service Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters. She criticized Facebook for its inability to resolve existing issues, and asked them to stop with development until some kind of regulatory framework existed to cover the scope of Libra.What do you think about Bitcoin, Mark Zuckerberg’s pet goat?

981,How Long Does a Bitcoin Bull Run Last? Proponents Use a Myriad of Charts and Models to Predict Future Prices,"May 11, 2021","As bitcoin prices hover above the $55k zone, a number of participants wonder when the bull run will end. Bitcoin proponents are convinced bull markets have three waves and another wave may start soon. However, despite a variety of tools being used like tarot cards, no one is truly sure what will happen with bitcoin and crypto markets next.Bitcoin enthusiasts are still very optimistic about the price of the leading crypto asset and many believe the bull run is not over. Traders and those who are extremely curious about short-term price swings have been leveraging a number of tools in order to predict the future price of BTC. Tools and charts utilized include the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, logarithmic growth curves, golden ratio multiplier, HODL waves, profitable days and so much more.For instance, the popular Twitter account Bitcoin Archive tweeted about realized cap HODL waves and shared an image from Glassnode’s platform to his 184,000 followers.“‘Hot money’ has cooled down and we can see a nicely formed 1st HODL wave (realised cap). Bitcoin bull markets typically have 3 waves— so expect another one to start soon,” Bitcoin Archive said. Following the tweet, the account Cryptovizart responded to the tweet and said the three-wave pattern was not happening like two previous cycles. Cryptovizart believes that institutional FOMO caused the first wave to last longer.Trends further show a popular question on Google is “How long does a Bitcoin bull run last?” and there are many editorials that cover this subject. On April 12, 2021, Rekt Capital published a comprehensive editorial on when the top will come. Rekt Capital says a typical bitcoin bull run lasts around 518 days.“It took roughly the same amount of time for bitcoin to bottom prior to halving #2 (546 days) as it took for bitcoin to rally before topping out after its second post-halving #1 market cycle (518 days),” the editorial notes.The popular Youtuber and digital currency proponent Colin Talks Crypto has been covering the bull run’s length for quite some time now. In a Youtube video published on April 17, Colin discusses when to sell and talked about his recently launched “Crypto Bitcoin Bull Run Index (CBBI ).”“The CBBI is an average of 11 different metrics to help us get a better idea of where we are in the Bitcoin bull run (and bear market) cycle,” the website description notes. Currently, Colin’s CBBI shows a score of 71 on May 10, 2021.“The Colin Talks Crypto Bitcoin Bull Run Index (CBBI) is an indicator based on a portfolio of 8 bitcoin metrics designed to give us a better idea of where we are in a Bitcoin bull run cycle,” the website explains. “The CBBI score is a ‘peak confidence score.’ As it approaches 100, it indicates we may be getting closer to a price top.A recent thread written by Coincharts on Twitter discussed the length of the current bull run in a tweetstorm this week.“Where are we in this bull run? It has now been 143 days since bitcoin broke the all-time high of 2017. But how far are we in this bull run, and how long will it take? This is of course very difficult to determine, but there are some things you can look at,” Coincharts said. Coincharts uses a number of tools like the “MA 200 Heatmap This indicator is a Moving Average over the last 200 week candles,” “Google Trends,” and “HODL waves.”Everyone has their special tool and technical analysis at their disposal, and some are utilizing bitcoin derivatives markets like futures and options to guess the price going forward. There are those that believe BTC’s Taproot upgrade could boost the price while others are counting on news like institutional adoption to keep the market bursting.There is no exact science or rhyme and reason when it comes to the future price of bitcoin. There will never be a tool that predicts markets perfectly, but we can guarantee market participants will always try to predict the future using anything they can to get ahead.What do you think about all the models and charts people use to measure the beginning and the end of bitcoin bull run cycles? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

The seven-time Super Bowl champion has added laser eyes to his Twitter profile.Football star Tom Brady has hopped on the bitcoin train. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, who plays in the National Football League (NFL), is widely considered to be the greatest quarterback of all time. He became the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time) in NFL history after winning his sixth Super Bowl two years ago. Brady has since won another Super Bowl.Responding to a tweet by Blockworks’ Jason Yanowitz that says: “Rumor has it Tom Brady is loading up on bitcoin. Retweet if you think the GOAT should turn on laser eyes. Let’s make it happen.” A few hours later, Brady replied: “Hmmmm should I change it??”Without revealing whether he has bought bitcoin, the star quarterback proceeded to change his profile picture on Twitter to one with laser eyes.The laser eyes meme has swept through the bitcoin community since February with the underlying meaning that anyone donning the eyes is laser-focused on bitcoin’s price rising to $100,000. Politicians, celebrities, and investors have partaken and put laser eyes on their profile images.The crypto community is very excited to have Brady onboard, viewing his laser eyes activation as very bullish. Many people on social media are already calling him a bitcoiner.Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted: “Bitcoin now has a star quarterback. Welcome to the team Tom Brady.” He explained: “Laser eyes proclaim a technology to guarantee the human rights of life, liberty, & property. Laser eyes channel action even as they protect from dilutive distraction. Laser eyes signal intent to make bitcoin an instrument of economic empowerment.” The Nasdaq-listed company has amassed almost 100K bitcoins for its treasury.Angel investor Balaji Srinivasan, formerly Coinbase’s CTO and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, commented:We have laser-eyed mayors, congressmen, senators, billionaires, and actors. Now we have the greatest quarterback of all time. Bitcoin has only two more levels left: the first laser-eyed central banker, and the first laser-eyed head of state.The seven-time Super Bowl champion is also planning to launch a non-fungible token (NFT) platform called Autograph this spring, CNN reported last month. Autograph will also produce NFT’s featuring Brady.A growing number of professional athletes are asking to be paid in bitcoin. Russell Okung, who famously said “pay me in bitcoin” and then opted to convert half of his $13-million salary to BTC, wrote: “Looks like Tom Brady is the tipping point. So many athletes are hitting me about bitcoin and crypto, I’m doing calls every day. I love it but I need to find a better way to automate.”Early this month, the number one NFL draft pick, Trevor Lawrence, put his signing bonus in cryptocurrencies, estimated to be worth $24 million. In April, Sean Culkin, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, said he would take his 2021 salary in bitcoin. In addition, the Sacramento Kings, an American professional basketball team, said it will offer everyone in its organization the option of getting their salary paid in bitcoin.Do you think Tom Brady is loading up on bitcoin?

983,Morgan Creek's Mark Yusko Predicts Bitcoin Can Reach $250K in 5 Years,"May 10, 2021","Mark Yusko, Morgan Creek Capital Management’s CEO and cofounder, is extremely bullish on bitcoin. Despite a period of consolidation, Yusko expects the leading crypto asset to tap $250,000 in five years. In a recent interview, he said that the network continues to swell in an “exponential way.”The founder of Morgan Creek is again reiterating his prediction that bitcoin (BTC) will surpass six digits in value within the next five years. In a May 6, 2020 interview, Yusko predicted that bitcoin could easily reach $100,000 in 2021 or 2022. Moreover, during the discussion, Yusko also stressed that bitcoin’s price could reach $400k to $500k as well.During this week’s interview with CNBC’s Trading Nation, Morgan Creek’s Mark Yusko explained that he believes investors “overlook and underestimate” the leading crypto asset.“It’s just about network adoption and increased usage,” Yusko said this week. “This is a network and networks grow in an exponential way. This is the fastest network in history to a trillion dollars of value, right on the heels of the FAANGS that took, you know, 15 to 20 years depending on which one you look at.”Yusko’s Morgan Creek cofounder, Anthony Pompliano, has also said he believes BTC will reach $100k. Pompliano recently interviewed with the popular Youtube investor Andrei Jikh, explaining the fundamentals of his prediction to Jikh’s 1.52 million subscribers.Yusko’s fundamentals are based on the equivalence of gold markets, which CNBC estimates to be around $4 trillion. If digital gold can capture a percentage of gold’s enormous global market, then Yusko insists BTC could make it to $1 million per unit.“What people miss is this is a technological evolution of computing power that isn’t going away,” Yusko stressed on CNBC’s Trading Nation. Yusko further added:It is a powerful computing network that is going to become the base layer protocol for the Internet of value.CNBC’s hosts asked Yusko about the gains dogecoin (DOGE) and ethereum (ETH) have seen lately, and the Morgan Creek executive said only a few crypto assets will make it in the long run.“Yes, there’s room for a couple of protocols to survive, but there are 1000s of coins and Doge is in that category that really are useless, they’re just utility tokens that have no underlying value or use case and they’ll eventually disappear,” Yusko insisted.Yusko’s BTC price forecast is not too different from the venture capitalist Tim Draper’s prediction, albeit a bit longer out. Draper predicts that bitcoin (BTC) could be $250,000 by the year 2022. People look up to Draper’s forecast because he correctly predicted bitcoin’s price would surpass $10,000 per coin by 2018.What do you think about Morgan Creek Capital Management’s Mark Yusko’s prediction?

984,Bitcoin's Smallest Unit: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Wants Crypto Exchanges to Quote Satoshis,"May 10, 2021","Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, wants exchanges to start listing in the smallest unit of bitcoin otherwise known as “satoshis”. On May 8, Novogratz tweeted out to a number of crypto exchange executives and asked “which exchange will be first to quote in SATS?”Bitcoin bull and investor Mike Novogratz is interested in seeing crypto trading platforms list the smallest unit of bitcoin (BTC) called “satoshis” or “SATS.” One can think of satoshis as the “cents” from dollars; they represent the fractional term of a portion of bitcoin. A satoshi is approximately 0.00000001 BTC. With BTC above the $57k handle at the time of writing, a single satoshi is worth $0.0005711 USD.On Saturday, Novogratz tweeted:It is time to switch to Satoshis. Too many people telling me at $58,000 BTC too expensive. Which exchange will be first to quote in SATS?His tweet further tagged the crypto exchange CEOs from Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, and FTX Exchange. Following the tweet, Kraken’s Dan Held asked the Kraken CEO Jesse Powell what he thought about the idea. The crypto exchange executive from Kraken responded to the thread, and said the exchange would have to think about the decision.“Have to think through the UX, discoverability,” the Kraken CEO remarked. “99% of new users coming in will be looking for bitcoin/BTC and have no idea what a satoshi/sat is. Don’t want to confuse them,” Powell added.The statement about satoshis was a popular tweet for Novogratz, gathering close to 10,000 likes and over 1,100 retweets. Moreover, the popular crypto market aggregator coinmarketcap.com has created a space for satoshis, showing the current value against the U.S. dollar. Satoshis tapped an all-time price high on April 14, 2021, at $0.000642 per satoshi.The Bitcoin community has been a fan of calling the cryptocurrency’s smallest unit a satoshi for quite some time. Many have advocated for pricing goods in satoshis, which could be easier than BTC’s 5-digit territories value. Some believe, however, that it is too early to price things in satoshis right now. Others have also clamored for the use of the terminology “sbtc” to price things in satoshis.It remains to be seen if crypto exchanges will decide to list the smallest fraction of bitcoin, but it is becoming a topical conversation again thanks to Novogratz.What do you think about the suggestion from Novogratz? Do you think exchanges should list satoshis? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

985,"Report: China's Bitcoin Hashrate Dominance Dives, 'North America Could Steal the Lead'","May 10, 2021","A newly published regional report shows that China’s hashrate has likely dropped to 55% while the U.S. has climbed to 11%. Another study predicts that it’s possible North America could overtake China in terms of hashrate by the end of 2021.For years now China has been the most dominant region in terms of bitcoin miners worldwide and at one point 65% to 70% of the network hashrate stemmed from the country. In May 2021, the Bitcoin hashrate is significantly higher nearing 200 exahash per second (EH/s) as a great number of participants are mining the crypto asset. At the time of writing, the global hashrate is around 181 EH/s following the massive drop in hashpower two weeks ago.Now a few reports are showing that China’s SHA256 hashrate dominance is steadily dropping and the U.S. and North America, in general, have become greater competitors. 8btc’s regional columnist, Iyke Aru explains that one reason hashrate is dropping in the country is because of China’s energy commitments.China’s communist government aims to reduce carbon emissions a great deal in the next few years and a recent proposal was invoked to shut down bitcoin miners located in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. Other regions like Sichuan are also tightening up energy requirements which are placing more demand on the region’s hydropower facilities.Another study, published by Sam Ling at the end of January 2021 shows that China’s hashrate dominance has dropped considerably this year. Ling’s study follows a report published by Bitooda that was released a few months prior in the summer of 2020. Bitooda’s report noted that China’s hashrate was estimated to be only 50% of the global hashrate and North American bitcoin mining was on the rise. Similarly, Ling’s report this published year indicates estimates are roughly the same.Ling’s data shows that China’s overall SHA256 hashrate is around 55%, while the U.S. now captures around 11%. At the beginning of 2021, mining industry leaders predicted that roughly 200,000 to 1 million ASIC mining rigs would be shipped internationally.The forecast predicts a rise to 240 EH/s by the end of the year. During the mining industry meeting, bitcoin mining farm operator, Yao Wanni says Chinese citizens are still buying mining rigs but North American ASIC purchases have catapulted.“The whole mining industry in North America is booming” Yao insisted at the time.The study forecasts the hashrate by 2022 and it predicts the U.S. could possibly overtake China’s dominant hashrate by then. The report also notes that unpublicized deals could make the ASIC shipment estimates much larger.Based on theoretical analysis Ling’s study says although it is “unlikely,” the possibility of North American hashpower dominance still exists. “North America could steal the lead of the BTC hashrate from China in 2021,” the report notes. “But only by purchasing at least an additional 630,000 ASICs,” Ling’s study adds.U.S. and Canadian miners will have to increase their ASIC machine power by 5x in order to bring North America to the forefront.“From our investigation, we find that in order for the USA and Canada to take the hashing power lead over China, they must secure a minimum of 63 more EH/s this year,” Ling’s study concludes. “This equates to an extra order of 630,000 ASICs, with an average of 100 TH/s, costing nearly $4 billion dollars,” he added.What do you think about China’s hashrate dominance dropping and the possibilty of North American miners dominating by the year’s end?

986,"Over 67,000 Fusions: Cashfusion Participants Have Fused Billions of Dollars in Bitcoin Cash","May 10, 2021","While some crypto users have been leveraging privacy-centric digital assets like monero, others still use mixing protocols that shuffle unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) from coins like bitcoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash. Participants using the Bitcoin Cash network utilize applications like Cashshuffle and Cashfusion. Since Cashfusion was introduced in November 2019, there’s been 67,845 fusions or $5.9 billion worth of bitcoin cash that’s been fused.During the bull run of 2021, Bitcoin Cash network users are using Cashfusion and Cashshuffle a great deal these days. The elder and sister protocol of Cashfusion, Cashshuffle still gets used today and at the time of writing, there’s been 65,682 shuffles with 283,217 BCH shuffled in total since the protocol’s inception.Now, of course, the UTXOs were not shuffled at the current exchange rate, but that’s around $377 million in shuffled BCH using today’s exchange rates. People have been leveraging Cashshuffle with bitcoin cash (BCH) since March 27, 2019, according to stats.devzero.be/#/shuffle data.But since Cashshuffle was released in March 2019, months later at the end of November, developers introduced Cashfusion to the BCH community. Currently, people can leverage bitcoin (BTC) using the Wasabi Wallet or Samourai, and ethereum (ETH) users can utilize the tornado.cash app. However, shuffling coins with BTC and ETH is harder because of the current fees both networks impose and it’s a lot more costly to use these protocols.Stats from bitcoinfees.cash shows that BCH network fees are negligible and mixing UTXOs doesn’t cost a user a lot of money using the Bitcoin Cash network. At the time of writing, the next BCH block fee is $0.0067 per transaction and the current median fee is $0.0032.Cashfusion saw a successful security audit from Kudelski Security just like Cashshuffle did prior to the official Cashfusion launch. Fusion tiers were expanded from 0.82 BCH to 8.2 BCH, which made it so whales can fuse coins together.Bitcoin Cash users were also pleased when software engineer James Waugh tested Cashfusion with thousands of transactions and published a review. Waugh’s review highlighted that while combing through a large swathe of Cashfusion transaction inputs and outputs, the developer realized that it’s “not possible to establish a concrete link” between them.Fast forward to May 2021 as BCH has rides above the $1,400 zone, Cashfusion is still getting lots of use from network participants.Data from stats.devzero.be/#/fusion shows that Cashfusion has seen approximately 4,453,681 BCH worth of fusions since 2019. Using today’s BCH exchange rates shows that’s more than $5.9 billion worth of bitcoin cash stretched across 67,845 fusions.The number of fusions and shuffles since 2019 indicates that people using BCH enjoy privacy-enhancing techniques and these tools. The average fee per satoshi using Cashfusion with BCH is only 168 satoshis and users have spent 750,533,047 satoshis for fusing since the app was invoked.What do you think about Cashfusion and Cashshuffle users mixing billions of dollars in bitcoin cash UTXOs? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

He says that he is “like Warren Buffett” in that he does not invest in things he does not understand. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway thinks bitcoin is “rat poison squared.”“Terminator” star Arnold Schwarzenegger talked about bitcoin during an interview with the New York Times published Thursday. Regarding bitcoin, the former California governor said:No, I don’t invest in them. I am like Warren Buffett. I don’t invest in things I don’t understand.The Berkshire Hathaway CEO has long been a bitcoin critic. He called it “rat poison squared” back in 2018 after his business partner Charlie Munger compared the cryptocurrency to “rat poison” and “turds.”Buffett is well known for operating within his “circle of competence,” meaning he does not invest in anything he does not understand.Schwarzenegger has turned to Buffett, sometimes known as the Oracle of Omaha, for advice several times over the years. When he campaigned for California governor in 2003, Buffett became his senior financial and economic advisor. Schwarzenegger won the special recall election and was in office until 2011.The Hollywood actor previously described Buffett as “the greatest investor ever, my mentor, and my hero,” adding that “Warren has a common-sense approach to business issues and an integrity that is unmatched. That’s the same way I want to approach governing. Warren always tells it the way it is.” Buffett was also one of Schwarzenegger’s advisors when he hosted “The New Celebrity Apprentice” in 2016.Early this month, Buffett and Munger commented about bitcoin at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting. While Buffett avoided commenting on the cryptocurrency directly because he did not want to upset investors who long bitcoin, Munger bluntly said, “I hate the bitcoin success.” He added, “The whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interest of civilization.”Do you think Schwarzenegger should follow Buffett’s strategy and stay away from bitcoin?

988,Joe Biden's Trillion-Dollar Stimulus Bill Pushes Miami Mayor to Buy Bitcoin,"May 9, 2021","Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has revealed that he bought bitcoin and ether right after the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill passed the Senate, heading to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed. He said bitcoin “is definitely going to go up … because I don’t think people are going to want to stay in dollar-denominated currencies.” Mayor Suarez is also working to make Miami a “crypto city.”Miami Mayor Francis Suarez revealed at the 2021 Ethereal Summit last week that he purchased bitcoin right after the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief stimulus package passed the Senate in March.In an interview with Decrypt Editor-in-Chief Dan Roberts and FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Mayor Suarez was asked whether he had already purchased bitcoin since he indicated in February that he would soon be ready to buy some cryptocurrencies. The mayor confirmed:I did buy, thankfully. I bought bitcoin and ethereum. I didn’t buy DOGE, but I did buy bitcoin and ethereum, and I bought it literally the day — I’ll never forget the moment — it was the day that the $1.9 trillion spending bill passed the Senate and it was going to the president’s desk.“I said I’m buying. That’s it. If the federal government’s going to spend $1.9 trillion then I think I need to have some, and this is definitely going to go up,” he shared.“And frankly if they spend another $2.2 trillion on infrastructure bill, it’s going to continue to go up. I mean there’s just no way that it can’t because I don’t think people are going to want to stay in dollar-denominated currencies,” Mayor Suarez opined.The Miami mayor also talked about how impressively big the crypto community is. “The number of customers, the number of holders of bitcoin and other crypto, you’re talking about tens of millions of people and I’m not so sure that the rest of the world really understands quite how voluminous, how exciting, and how energetic the crypto community is,” he described.Mayor Suarez is also currently working to make Miami a “crypto city.” He detailed that besides hosting the bitcoin whitepaper on the city’s website, Bitcoin Conference 2021 will be held in Miami. In addition, he highlighted:We passed a resolution that would allow for employees to get paid in bitcoin, would allow for our residents to pay for fees in bitcoin, and would allow us to potentially have it as a balance sheet item.“I think we took a very progressive stance. We are very aggressive. I went to Wyoming, found their legislative package, tried to introduce it in the state legislation, [and] got very close to passing it on its first attempt, which is very unusual,” he detailed.He added that it “passed the entire House and passed almost the entire Senate,” but noted, “I got bogged down in one last committee for an unrelated reason.”The mayor described: “It’s an exciting time and I do think that this is the future of our world. And if we want to be a tech city in Miami, we have to take advantage of these opportunities to differentiate ourselves and get ahead of our competition.”Do you agree with the Miami mayor on bitcoin and what do you think of his efforts to make Miami a crypto city?

989,Ukraine’s Public Radio Launches Podcast With an Episode on Bitcoin,"May 9, 2021","In an attempt to expand and diversify its audience, the public radio of Ukraine has recently entered the world of podcasts. Listeners have been invited to choose among a variety of topics and genres. A podcast devoted to personal finance management and financial literacy kicks off with an episode about Bitcoin. The National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (NSTU) has launched several podcasts to better promote the programs of its radio stations, Ukrainian Radio, Radio Kultura, and Radio Promin. It also hopes to offer its audience exclusive content in a convenient format, including new projects such as documentaries and conversations with interesting guests. Dmytro Khorkin, Board Member at the NSTU responsible for radio programs, elaborated:For NSTU radio stations, podcasts are an additional opportunity to reach out to an audience that consumes audio content through digital platforms. They are created and launched in cooperation with the Digital Platforms Department.The podcasts are available online on Soundcloud, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, and Anchor. The programs deal with various social, economic, and political topics, producing anything from historic audio documentaries about the Chernobyl disaster and the 90s crisis, to in-studio discussions on contemporary challenges such as the rampant corruption in modern Ukraine and the political struggles of rights activists in Russia-annexed Crimea.How to earn, spend and earn again even more money is the key question a podcast called “100 Thousand” aims to answer. The authors of the program, led by Ukrainian Radio host Roman Kolyada, want to help you learn how to plan your budget, save intelligently and increase your funds through smart investments. The main purpose of the project is to improve financial literacy among Ukrainians and that’s probably the reason why the podcast launched with an episode devoted to decentralized digital money:In the first episode we talk about cryptocurrencies. Why are they rising so fast? What’s the difference between cryptocurrency and traditional money? And most importantly, is it worth investing your savings in crypto?Cryptocurrencies have seen strong growth in the past months and many Ukrainians would like to know if bitcoin and other digital currencies have a place in their savings and investment portfolios. The first guest of the podcast, Yevhen Nevmerzhytskyi, who holds a Ph.D. in economics, tries his best to answer all these questions for the audience.Ukrainians have a generally positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies and their country is among the world’s leaders in terms of adoption. A report by the blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis ranked Ukraine first among 154 nations in last year’s edition of its Global Crypto Adoption Index. The government in Kiev is also open toward the digital assets space and works on a project to launch its own CBDC in close cooperation with members of the crypto industry.What do you think about the podcasts launched by Ukraine’s public radio?

990,Bitcoin Mining Operation Bitfarms to be Listed on Nasdaq Following DTC Eligibility,"May 8, 2021","The Toronto-based Bitcoin mining operation Bitfarms announced the company has been approved for a common stock listing on Nasdaq Global Market tier. The company is already listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the firm’s Nasdaq listing will be listed under the ticker symbol “BITF.”Bitfarms has announced that it will be a publicly-traded Bitcoin miner listed on Nasdaq Global Market tier. The tier platform by Nasdaq is reserved for companies who have sustainable finances and pass requirements that go above and beyond Nasdaq’s lower tiers. The company Bitfarms, which was invoked in 2017, says the Nasdaq Global Market tier acceptance “represents a powerful validation.”“The approval for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market is an incredible achievement for Bitfarms and is the fruition of multiple years of work and dedication,” Emiliano Grodzki, Bitfarms’ chief executive officer said. “Over the last four years, we have managed to build and operate one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations worldwide. It is fitting that we will be listing on one of the most prestigious exchanges in the world and significantly expand the market reach of our company.”The Bitfarms Nasdaq listing follows the company’s recent partnership with Foundry and the fleet’s expansion of 2,465 bitcoin miners. Bitfarms also plans to launch a mining facility in Argentina in order to obtain electricity rates at $0.02 per kilowatts per hour (kWh). Two days ago, the firm announced the purchase of 6,600 S19j Antminers from Bitmain. The miners will give Bitfarms around 2.5 exahash per second (EH/s) this fall. “The additional 660 PH that will be added to their mining operations will solidify their presence in the mining space, further establishing Bitfarms as one of the leading mining companies in North America,” remarked Irene Gao, Antminer sales director of NCSA region, Bitmain. The last requirement the mining operation must pass is the confirmation of eligibility for the electronic clearing and settlement through the Depository Trust Company (DTC). If the approval is granted then Bitfarms will be able to list “BITF” on Nasdaq Global Market tier.What do you think about Bitfarms approval to be listed on Nasdaq?

992,Iran Warns Crypto Investors Amid Ban on Bitcoin Mined Outside Its Borders,"May 8, 2021","The Central Bank of Iran has issued a warning against unrestrained crypto trading and reminded investors that only cryptocurrencies minted by licensed miners in the Islamic Republic can be used under limited circumstances. Traders will bear full responsibility for the risks, the bank cautioned, although spending crypto on imports through approved banks and exchanges remains legal. The popularity of cryptocurrencies among Iranians has grown significantly with the rising prices of the decentralized assets in recent months, Fars News Agency noted in a report. Crypto trading platforms have taken advantage of the volatile state of the Iranian stock market, where deals have seen a remarkable decline since last summer. Quoted by ILNA, a member of the High Council of Securities and Exchange which governs the stock market, Mohsen Alizadeh, noted:The capital outflow is traceable. Liquidity has flown into parallel markets, including digital currency.According to his figures, 1,500 trillion rials of capital, or $7 billion, has left the Iranian stock market through major shareholders and institutional traders. The Financial Tribune reported that the main index of the Tehran Stock Exchange, TEDPIX, has dropped 50% in the past few months. On this backdrop, the Central Bank of Iran has now recommended that Iranians avoid dealing in cryptocurrency, warning them that crypto investments would be at their own risk.The CBI has effectively banned the use of foreign-mined cryptocurrencies. In the statement released this week, the financial authority reminded the Iranian public of an earlier government decision, according to which only cryptocurrencies mined in Iran, and in accordance with the law, can be transferred. “Authorized money exchangers and banks can settle forex payments intended for imports through the cryptocurrencies mined inside the country,” detailed the announcement, quoted by Fars.In April, the CBI permitted the use of decentralized money in cross-border payments to foreign suppliers in accordance with its guidelines. The cryptocurrency spent on imports has to be provided by crypto miners operating in Iran. The mining entities must be licensed by the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Trade, the institution emphasized.A report quoted by Bitcoin.com News in April revealed that lenders and licensed currency exchange offices have been notified about the crypto payment regulations. The Central Bank of Iran has adopted the new policy in an attempt to circumvent, or at least minimize the impact of sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Iranian financial transactions with the rest of the world.The latest CBI announcement suggests that the same rules apply to cryptocurrency trading. “The Central Bank announced that according to the decision of the Cabinet, trading of digital currencies extracted abroad is prohibited and only currencies extracted inside the country can be traded,” reads the unedited English translation of a Farsi tweet by the Iran International news channel.The CBI is also mulling the launch of its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Earlier this year, it revealed it’s reviewing different options to issue a digital rial and studying similar projects in countries such as China and the Russian Federation. At the same time, the bank reaffirmed its commitment to implementing laws aimed at curbing money laundering. In January, Governor Abdolnaser Hemmati vowed that the CBI will continue to implement regulations limiting financial transactions through anonymous accounts.What do you think about Iran’s warning against crypto investments and the ban on the use of cryptocurrency mined abroad?

993,"New SEC Chairman Unveils Policies for Cryptocurrencies, Calls Bitcoin 'Scarce Store of Value'","May 8, 2021","The new chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has shared his view on how the SEC plans to regulate cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin. He calls bitcoin “a digital, scarce store of value” and stresses the need to put in place some investor protections for this asset class.SEC Chair Gary Gensler talked about cryptocurrency policies and bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Friday. Gensler taught classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in financial technology, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. He was confirmed as the new SEC chairman last month.Replying to a question about how he would regulate cryptocurrencies, the chairman replied, “To the extent that something is a security, the SEC has a lot of authority.” Noting he will refer to cryptocurrencies as “crypto tokens,” the former MIT professor emphasized that “a lot of crypto tokens … are indeed securities.”He then referenced work done by the prior chairman and the SEC under his leadership. “The prior SEC brought numerous enforcement actions to sort of bring some of these security or investment contract tokens to into the rules,” Gensler said.The SEC chair then turned his focus to bitcoin, stating that it is “about half of this $2 trillion asset class right now.” He opined:It’s a digital, scarce store of value, but highly volatile, and there’s investors that want to trade that … for its volatility, in some cases just because it is lower correlation with other markets. I think that we need greater investor protection there.Gensler noted that currently there is no “federal regime overseeing the crypto exchanges,” unlike with stock and derivatives markets.He emphasized that if investors want to trade cryptocurrencies, then the SEC needs to “have in place some investor protection.” He noted that this is “a gap in our system right now” that needs to be addressed.Speaking solely about bitcoin and not any other tokens, Gensler explained that the SEC’s “sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] has limited anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority.” Nonetheless, he reiterated that “There’s no federal authority to actually bring a regime to the crypto exchanges.”The new SEC chair further noted:We will be working with Congress, and if they see fit, to try to bring some protection for people that want to invest in this speculative asset class.What do you think about SEC Chair Gensler’s comments on bitcoin and crypto regulation?

994,Marathon Mines First OFAC Compliant Bitcoin Block,"May 7, 2021","Marathon, one of the biggest bitcoin mining dedicated companies in the U.S. and Canada, has mined the first OFAC compliant bitcoin block, only accepting transactions that comply with the directives of this government office. This has caused a stir in libertarian circles, that argue this can be the start of censorship in the bitcoin blockchain at a mining level.Marathon, a North America-based mining company, has mined the first OFAC compliant bitcoin block yesterday, that only included KYC validated transactions and excluded transactions from addresses coming from sanctioned subjects. The block was found five days after Marathon completed the transition from its other pools to its completely compliant mining pool on May 1st. Since that day, the whole 10.37 EH/S are assigned to only mine KYC/OFAC compliant transactions.While still somewhat new, in 2018 the OFAC started including cryptocurrency addresses associated coming from “Specially Designated Nationals” that are blocked due to its relations with criminal activities and money laundering. As an example, 20 addresses associated with the Lazarus group, a hacking North Korea-based cybercrime group were added to this list just last year, among many others.The company explained its intention of just mining clean blocks earlier this year, with its CEO declaring they were dedicated to satisfying the need for untainted bitcoin for the institutional market in the U.S. Merrick Okamoto, Executive Chairman of Marathon, stated:“While institutional interest in Bitcoin is accelerating, many large funds and corporations have expressed concerns over purchasing Bitcoin that may have been tainted by nefarious actors,”Marathon uses a specially designed software for filtering these non-compliant transactions designed by DMG Blockchain called Blockseer, licensed via a memorandum of understanding on March 31.Marathon has upset the libertarian community, which values fungibility and the principle of censorship-resistance as the pillars of the proposition of the Bitcoin network. To some, this might be the start of a division between “clean” bitcoin produced by U.S.-based, regulated companies, and tainted coins coming from other non-compliant sources. This could affect the free exchanging of bitcoins all over the world, effectively dividing the market.On the other hand, this might be seen as an overstatement of the problem at this stage. Marathon only controls 6% of the total hash rate in the bitcoin network, and that is unlikely to have any real effect on censoring transactions because there are plenty of miners available to receive them yet. However, the door is now open for regulations that tackle censorship at a mining level.What do you think of Marathon mining only OFAC compliant blocks? Tell us in the comments sections below.

995,"Report Finds Argentineans Are Becoming Increasingly Interested in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stablecoins","May 7, 2021","Over a million Argentineans have been buying cryptocurrencies in the last few months, and a pattern has been spotted among them in terms of preferences. A local media outlet unveiled that most of them are decanted to acquire bitcoin and stablecoins.According to Ámbito, citing data from South American digital assets crypto exchanges, the boom on such markets had driven Argentina to look for other virtual currencies rather than bitcoin (BTC).In fact, per the media outlet, most Argentineans also buy USD-pegged stablecoins, such as dai (DAI), USD coin (USDC), and tether (USDT).As the number of users coming from Argentina keeps skyrocketing, exchanges like Ripio have praised such a growing number. Its director, Juan José Méndez, commented on the matter:The pandemic accelerated the adoption of crypto platforms. Today we have 1 million users in Argentina when at the beginning of 2020 we had 400 thousand, and it is a figure that grows month by month.The report also highlights that stablecoin preference in Argentina started to gather momentum in 2019 due to the US dollar’s buying cap imposed in the country.Users perceived such tokens as a more effective way to convert their fiat Argentinean pesos into dollars by backing them on such kinds of digital assets.But BTC is not the major crypto whose interest had increased in Argentina. Marcelo Cavazzoli, CEO and co-founder of the Argentinean crypto wallet Lemon Cash, pointed out that ethereum (ETH) has its share in the adoption’s figures:“Stablecoins are an ideal gateway because they are not subject to market volatility. That gives security to users. In turn, they are already the first step to move to other currencies, and we notice that more and more bitcoin and ethereum are also positioned as two cryptos to safeguard value, beyond their investment possibilities.There are 20 cryptocurrency exchanges legally operating in the South American country, where people could use their Argentinean peso fiat to acquire digital assets.What are your thoughts on the report’s findings? Let us know in the comments section below.

996,FBI Puts Warning Signs on Bitcoin ATMs in This US County Following a Scam,"May 6, 2021","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is putting up warning signs on bitcoin ATMs in Cuyahoga County of the U.S. state of Ohio to warn residents not to fall for scams asking victims to send money to scammers via bitcoin ATMs.The Cuyahoga County Scam Squad in Cleveland and the FBI are collaborating to alert the public about scams involving bitcoin, News 5 Cleveland reported this week. Old scams ranging from grandparent’s scam, explained Sheryl Harris, Director of the Cuyahoga County Department of Consumer Affairs.FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson warned that once the victims sent bitcoin, “it’s almost impossible to get it back so the best we can do is prevention and that’s why we’re trying to get the word out.”The news outlet described that “Signs will soon be put up on bitcoin ATMs across the county,” noting that “The signs are intended to make people think twice before going through with a transaction because they could be caught in a scam.”Harris elaborated:The point of the signs is to just give people a chance to pause, like wait a minute … The government isn’t going to ask you for bitcoin, they just won’t, the jail won’t ask you to pay in bitcoin and your utility company doesn’t accept bitcoin payments.The FBI and the Cuyahoga County Department of Consumer Affairs issued last week an alert to local businesses to be on the lookout for bitcoin ATM scams. The authorities are asking for businesses to display these warning signs in a “noticeable place or near the ATM.”A man who almost became a victim of a scam asking for bitcoin told the news outlet that he got a call from someone who sounded just like his son, who said he was hurt in a car accident, got thrown in jail, and needed bond money.The man and his wife were instructed to withdraw $9,000 in cash, go to a bitcoin ATM, then use the QR code the scammer provided to deposit the cash. The man said that the shopkeeper where the ATM resided came up and said “can I help you?” When he explained that he needed to send money to an attorney with the bitcoin ATM, the shopkeeper told him that he was getting scammed. The couple then called their son and confirmed it was a scam.Bryan P. Smith, the FBI’s assistant special agent in charge, cautioned: “Education and prevention are the best tools to avoid being a victim of a financial scam … It is imperative for consumers to verify financial transactions prior to sending money in any form, including virtual currency. Be financially safe, learn more before sending.”What do you think about the FBI putting warning notices on Bitcoin ATMs? Let us know in the comments section below.

999,Climate Change Targets Bitcoin Mining: NY Lawmaker Proposes 3-Year Moratorium on Mining Operations in the State,"May 5, 2021","U.S. bureaucrats, particularly Democrats, are concerned about climate change and have introduced lots of legislation in order to address these concerns. Now a lawmaker from New York wants to establish a moratorium for bitcoin mining facilities located in the state, which means cryptocurrency miners in New York would have to halt operations. Senator Kevin Parker (D) believes bitcoin mining has a negative environmental impact and businesses would have to pass state greenhouse gas emission targets in order to continue.Mainstream media and politicians worldwide are concerned about the environmental impact bitcoin (BTC) or cryptocurrency mining will produce in the future. Bitcoin mining leverages large amounts of electricity in order for miners to process blocks and secure the network.The United States has increased its population of bitcoin miners in recent years, and there are a number of bitcoin mining facilities in upstate New York. Bureaucrats from the state do not like cryptocurrency mining because it is “energy-intensive.”In the recently submitted legislation proposed in the New York Senate called “Bill 6486,” Senator Kevin Parker and Rachel May (D) stress that crypto mining “threatens not only New York’s climate goals, under the CLCPA, but also global energy policy, such as the Paris Agreement.”New York Senate Bill 6486 states:[This Bill] establishes a moratorium on the operation of cryptocurrency mining centers; provides that operation of a cryptocurrency mining center shall only be authorized following completion of a full generic environmental impact statement review and a finding that such center will not adversely affect the state greenhouse gas emission targets in the climate leadership and community protection act of 2019.The halt on mining operations would be a “three-year moratorium” and the “Environmental impact statement shall be subject to 120 days of public comment from the date of issuance,” the bill notes. Further, New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation will conduct a public hearing in each of the seven regions located in the state.The bill says that the main reasoning for the three-year moratorium on crypto mining is because of the threats climate change can do to New York’s environment.The bill highlights things like “flooding, sea level rise, heat waves, coastal erosion, erratic and unpredictable weather patterns, shifting climatic zones, loss of wildlife, increased harmful algal blooms and invasive species, and increased risk of disease, in part, which leads directly to loss of life, property damage and reduction in value, ecological damage, and increased infrastructure costs.”Democrat Senators Kevin Parker and Rachel May insist that it is the policy of New York to improve such things and conserve and protect the state’s environment.What do you think about New York placing a possible three-year moratorium on crypto mining?

1000,Bitcoin Cash Slated for May 15- Upgrade to Bring Improvements for Users and Merchants,"May 5, 2021","On May 15, 2021, the Bitcoin Cash network will undergo the process of an upgrade that will bring a handful of improvements. These updates include the removal of the unconfirmed transaction limit, enabling multiple OP_RETURNS, the implementation of double-spend proofs, and the inclusion of a new mining block default limit size of 8 MB, as the inclusion of CHIPs (Cash Improvement Proposals) to introduce new specification changes to the protocol.The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network will experience an upgrade on May 15th that will bring a series of simple, yet interesting changes focused on usability and quality of life improvements instead of hard changes to the consensus algorithm. Most of the important changes are destined to improve the experience of users and merchants when using bitcoin cash to make online or in-store payments, reaffirming the commitment the currency has with becoming a peer-to-peer cash-focused tool.The first important change proposed is the removal of the unconfirmed chained transaction limit, which will allow users to do more than 50 chained unconfirmed transactions at a time. This was a highly requested feature for a long time by gambling sites and other high volumes, quick transaction apps that relied on Bitcoin Cash as a payment solution. Satoshi Dice, a dice-playing app, even offered a bounty of 1000 BCH last year to get rid of this limit. Now, its users will be able to enjoy a more streamlined experience without having to wait for a block to be mined every 50 transactions.Another important update is the introduction of double-spend tests, that will allow nodes to message certain wallets when an attempt of double spending is happening with a transaction. This will improve the security of 0-conf transactions for applications that use high-volume, high-value transactions commonly.Other important updates include changing the default block mining max size to eight megabytes, something that will allow new installs and lazy operators to include mine bigger blocks without having to configure this parameter by themselves (but the option can be changed), and the inclusion of more than one OP_RETURN statement in each transaction, offering programmers the choice of using this space for other different purposes while still preserving its use for the SLP token protocol.One of the most criticized aspects of the upgrade/ hard fork the process of Bitcoin Cash was the centralization and transparency of what was going to be included in each upgrade and what was definitely left out. For past updates, there was no standard to follow and goalposts and objectives were often moved with no definition. To solve this particular problem, the node programming community introduced the concept of CHIPs.CHIPs (Cash Improvement Proposals) are standardized proposals that seek to modify or improve certain aspects of the Bitcoin Cash environment. These CHIPs would have to be first presented to the community to be considered by full node client programmers, who will try to find consensus to include (or reject any significant modification. Most of the CHIPs presented till now are hosted on the Bitcoin Cash Research page, which serves as a sort of hub for these considerations.All of this will need a longer period to take care of and examine each one of the proposals before an update; this is the reason why this upgrade is also modifying the schedule for upgrades to happen once every year. This is a more stable approach that now allows for more experimentation and careful consideration of more radical changes to the protocol for future upgrade cycles.Meanwhile, bitcoin cash (BCH) markets have seen significant gains during the last 48 hours, jumping over the $1,200 per unit range on Wednesday morning (ET).What do you think about the Bitcoin Cash May 15 network upgrade?

1001,How Did Satoshi Nakamoto Remain Anonymous? A Detailed Look at the Bitcoin Creator’s Opsec,"May 5, 2021","The creator of the world’s first successful blockchain network has been an enigma ever since the mysterious inventor released the white paper over 12 years ago. Interestingly, Satoshi Nakamoto worked on the Bitcoin project publicly for 25 months and 13 days, all while being able to remain completely anonymous.Satoshi Nakamoto is a very interesting mystery and the inventor of the technological revolution that was invoked by the birth of the Bitcoin network. We don’t know much about Satoshi, except for what the creator told the public while he/she or they were around. Satoshi Nakamoto managed to stay anonymous, while releasing the protocol’s white paper, kickstarting the network, and even dealing with development contributors. Satoshi continues to remain anonymous to this day.There are hard facts that we do know about Satoshi, and many things we simply assume. For instance, it is assumed that this past April 5th, Bitcoin’s inventor turned 46-years old. But that date, of course, is only if that’s Satoshi Nakamoto’s legitimate age.The thing is, Satoshi managed to stay unknown the whole time, and to this day people believe the inventor either disappeared for good or is possibly dead. If Satoshi is alive, Bitcoin’s creator is one of the wealthiest individuals alive today because it is estimated that the inventor holds 1 million BTC.Of course, the approximate number of how many coins Satoshi holds is also unknown, and we really don’t know if the creator still has access to the keys. What we do know for sure, is that Satoshi was exceptional at staying anonymous. Just recently, Bitcoin Magazine’s editor, Pete Rizzo, published a comprehensive report on the alleged final message Satoshi sent on April 26, 2011, and the creator’s last days in the public eye.According to former Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen and Pete Rizzo’s report, after Satoshi released his final message in December 2010 and published Bitcoin version 0.3.19, Nakamoto asked if Andresen could refer to him more as a “tech lead” than a “mysterious shadowy figure.”Rizzo’s report says in April 2011 Satoshi wrote:The press just turns [the mysterious shadowy figure description] into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open-source project and give more credit to your contributors; it helps motivate them.One of the biggest questions people often ask is: How did Satoshi Nakamoto remain anonymous? Well, Satoshi did a great number of things to stay private like not revealing his real name and identity, and choosing to leverage a pseudonymous Japanese surname called “Satoshi Nakamoto.”Bitcoin’s inventor further chose to associate with people who respected privacy a great deal, and the creator appealed to the libertarian mindset right away. The introduction of Bitcoin was perfectly timed following the 2008 financial crisis that shook the world.In a number of social media posts on Reddit and bitcointalk.org, it is assumed that Satoshi utilized a virtual private network (VPN) and even Tor. Nakamoto had spoken about Tor before and told the public it was a good way to obfuscate where a bitcoin transaction came from.In one archived Reddit post published seven years ago, a Redditor explains how Satoshi also registered domains anonymously. The person said that there may be a weakness in the way Satoshi Nakamoto registered with anonymousspeech.com.“At this time however bitcoin did not exist so he had to either make a wire transfer with Western Union, use Paypal, a bank transfer, or send a check. So they may know who he is,” the now-deleted account said.Besides Tor and a VPN, it is also assumed that Satoshi Nakamoto leveraged a number of other ideas to conceal his identity. Nakamoto leveraged things like a free hosting company, free webmail, and anonymous webmail too.“Some [people], including myself, have looked at the timestamps on his Sourceforge commits and mail and forum posts to make guesses of location. Nothing is really definitive,” the deleted account’s comment from seven years ago insists.The Redditor added:Even though his efforts to remain anonymous are not bulletproof, they are extreme. He clearly had reason to want to avoid being found. Reasons beyond making an idea more widely attractable through non-attribution.The reasons as to why Satoshi Nakamoto chose to stay anonymous are also assumed and unknown. Predominantly, people believe it was for the inventor’s own safety. Being the inventor of a technology that can bypass corporate control, government manipulation, and work above and beneath the current monetary system has made Nakamoto extremely famous.People have been hunting for Nakamoto for a very long time and some individuals have even claimed to be Bitcoin’s inventor on many occasions.Although, none of them have succeeded in proving they are Satoshi Nakamoto, even though a few have tried incredibly hard to do so. Satoshi’s initial years of anonymity have made it so people highly doubt rambunctious individuals doing everything they can to prove they created the protocol.So how did Satoshi Nakamoto remain anonymous all these years? Well, the inventor was not only clever at designing the protocol, but was also smart enough to leverage great operations security (opsec) while remaining in the public eye.Satoshi Nakamoto applied and deployed many tools that kept his/her or their identity a complete secret that has lasted the test of time. One thing people assume is that after Satoshi said farewell between December 2010 and the ostensible April email in 2011, is that it is very possible Nakamoto had passed away and remains anonymous because of death.For instance, some assume Satoshi could have been the now-deceased Hal Finney. Others have pointed at the criminal mastermind Paul Le Roux, who is in jail and cannot communicate to the public even if he was Satoshi in any anonymous manner.Whatever the case may be, Satoshi deserves a great deal of credit for creating Bitcoin, but also for being able to stay anonymous for more than 12 years if the inventor is still alive.What do you think about Satoshi Nakamoto and how the inventor was able to remain anonymous for so long? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

1002,JPMorgan Boss Jamie Dimon Says 'I Don't Care About Bitcoin' but Clients Are Interested,"May 5, 2021","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has reaffirmed his stance on bitcoin while acknowledging that his bank’s clients are interested in the cryptocurrency. “I don’t tell clients what to do,” he said while emphasizing that he does not care about bitcoin.Jamie Dimon talked about bitcoin during The Wall Street Journal CEO Council summit on Tuesday. Reaffirming his stance on the cryptocurrency, the JPMorgan boss elaborated:I am not a bitcoin supporter. I don’t really care about bitcoin … I have no interest in it.He noted that he expects his bitcoin comments to draw attention. “I know I’m going to get tons of emails after this,” he said. Back in September 2017, Dimon called bitcoin a fraud.While the JPMorgan CEO may not support bitcoin, his bank is starting to provide some products that are related to cryptocurrencies. In March, JPMorgan launched a crypto investment product tracking public company stocks with bitcoin exposure. The bank is rumored to soon provide clients access to bitcoin investments.Dimon admitted that JPMorgan’s clients are interested in bitcoin, stating:On the other hand, clients are interested and I don’t tell clients what to do … They want to be able to put it on statements, they want to be able to buy and sell it.“If we can help them do those things very, very safely with all the proper disclosures then, you know … it’s not my job to decide what they’re going to do with their money,” the JPMorgan CEO affirmed. A growing number of corporations are putting bitcoin on their balance sheets, such as Microstrategy, Tesla, and Square.Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s co-president, explained in February that he is certain the demand for bitcoin “will be [there] at some point.” The executive added that “If over time an asset class develops that is going to be used by different asset managers and investors, we will have to be involved.”Meanwhile, Dimon is pro-blockchain. “Blockchain is real. We use it,” the CEO shared. “But people have to remember that a currency is supported by the taxing authority of a country, the rule of law, a central bank.”JPMorgan recently highlighted three reasons for investing in bitcoin after its analysts predicted that the price of the cryptocurrency could reach $146K as its competition with gold heats up. The firm subsequently lowered its bitcoin price estimate to $130K but said that clients can put 1% of their portfolios in BTC. In April, Dimon said that cryptocurrencies are emerging issues that need to be dealt with quickly.What do you think about JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s comments about bitcoin?

1003,"Hundreds of Banks in US to Allow Customers to Buy, Sell, Hold Bitcoin Through Existing Bank Accounts","May 5, 2021","Hundreds of banks in the U.S. will reportedly start offering access to bitcoin to their customers this year, thanks to a partnership between Fidelity National Information Services and the New York Digital Investment Group. Hundreds of banks have enrolled to participate in the program as they see funds moving from bank accounts to crypto exchanges.Customers of hundreds of banks in the U.S. will soon be able to buy, hold and sell bitcoin through their existing accounts, CNBC reported Wednesday.This will be made possible thanks to a partnership between fintech giant Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), the bitcoin investment arm of $10 billion New York-based Stone Ridge Asset Management. The two firms said that the collaboration is “to enable U.S. banks to offer bitcoin in the coming months,” the publication conveyed. FIS is a vendor to banks with nearly 300 million checking accounts.Patrick Sells, head of bank solutions at NYDIG, said that hundreds of banks are already enrolled in the program. While noting that the firm is in talks with some of the biggest banks in the country about offering the bitcoin service, he said most banks that have enrolled are smaller banks. He was quoted as saying:What we’re doing is making it simple for everyday Americans and corporations to be able to buy bitcoin through their existing bank relationships. If I’m using my mobile application to do all of my banking, now I have the ability to buy, sell and hold bitcoin.Yan Zhao, president of NYDIG, explained that banks used to steer clear of bitcoin but they are now asking about providing crypto investment services because they can see their customers moving money out of their bank accounts to crypto exchanges. She opined:This is not just the banks thinking that their clients want bitcoin, they’re saying ‘We need to do this, because we see the data.’ They’re seeing deposits going to the Coinbases and Galaxies and Krakens of the world.Rob Lee, head of digital banking at FIS, expects major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to come under pressure to offer crypto investments to retail banking customers when they see hundreds of smaller banks provide the crypto service.Some major investment banks have already begun providing wealthy clients access to bitcoin investments. Morgan Stanley announced in March that it will begin offering bitcoin funds to wealthy clients. Goldman Sachs then said that it will offer a full spectrum of bitcoin investments. JPMorgan is also reportedly looking at its own product in conjunction with NYDIG.Zhao added:Most people can’t invest in things that institutional investors get to invest in. With bitcoin available through your bank to be purchased with as little as $1, now you have an attractive asset that’s available to be owned by anyone in any amount. We think that’s huge for economic empowerment.FIS will handle the link to lenders while NYDIG, not banks, will take care of bitcoin custody and trade execution, the publication noted. Zhao explained that the cryptocurrency will not be FDIC-insured. Sells further shared that NYDIG plans to provide other services, including debit card rewards paid in bitcoin, and a new type of bank account that is FDIC insured, but pays interest in bitcoin.What do you think about banks offering access to bitcoin for retail customers?

However, adoption is on the rise in different industries, and the healthcare sector is joining the frenzy.According to Forbes Negocios, the Spanish healthcare group Biziondo, specializing in spine treatments, will accept bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto asset payments within its clinical facilities across Spain.After seeing a rising adoption of what they called a “bitcoin revolution” globally, the management became interested in blockchain technology and not depending wholly on the traditional banks or intermediaries for payments.David Izquierdo, general manager of Biziondo, commented on the announcement:It is clear that the bitcoin revolution has already started. In an economic context in which, in 2020, 60% of the world’s money was printed by European, United States and Japanese central banks, a financial disaster will inevitably be reached in approximately 2 or 5 years.He added that although the future “is always scary,” humans have historically shown that “we are very capable of adapting to changes and what is coming is going to be a new revolution comparable to the appearance of the internet.”The healthcare group has facilities in Bilbao, Madrid, San Sebastián, Málaga, and Lorca, where people could start to pay with cryptos on June 1, 2021.Izquierdo also pointed out the way that the company further studied the blockchain technology before making its inception to adopt bitcoin payments, as well as its role in private medicine:With the elimination of ‘money b’ in the field of private medicine, a new philosophy is promoted in which citizens have the power to regulate ourselves autonomously.

It’s often referred to as the first actual AAA game on Ethereum. The world of Illuvium is a world full of beauty and wonder inhabited by creatures known as Illuvials. From a visual perspective, Illuvials go way beyond crypto kitties, one of the earliest and most famous examples of non-fungible tokens. These illuvials are designed as high-quality 3D art made by some of the leading artists in the space.While venturing through the vast landscape of Illuvium, players can capture Illuvials by beating them in battle and then nursing them back to health. The Illuvials will become part of a player’s loyal following and can be used in fights or other adventures.

Their vision, and target audience spans further than the usual crypto community most projects are focused around, giving them an edge and further possibility to build further adoption in the market.”Chaudhry continues on by saying; “We’re very excited to see how Illuvium will continue to empower their vision for the future of blockchain based gaming. With their launch being planned for Q3 this year, accompanied with the listing of the Illuvium token (ILV) on our exchange, we can’t wait to see where this project will be in the following years.”Kieran Warwick, Co-founder of Illuvium, also expressed his enthusiasm of the listing, stating: “We’re excited about Bitcoin.com Exchange listing our $ILV token.

1008,Gold Bug vs. Bitcoin Bug: A Look at the Curious Relationship Between Peter and Spencer Schiff,"May 3, 2021","For years now the well known economist and gold bug Peter Schiff has continuously spoken out against bitcoin, as he claims precious metals are far superior. A great number of people have rebutted Schiff’s statements about bitcoin but during the last year, the gold bug has had a different thorn on his side. In recent days, Schiff’s nemesis on Twitter is his own son Spencer Schiff, a young entrepreneur who is “interested in finance, Austrian economics, libertarianism, [and] anarcho-capitalism.”During the last year, Bitcoin.com News has reported on Peter Schiff on numerous occasions and one time our newsdesk did a report on his father Irwin Schiff. His now-deceased father Irwin was a very popular libertarian and tax resistance advocate who published a number of books.In other instances this year, our newsdesk also covered Peter’s son as well. Peter’s son, Spencer Schiff, is an advocate for bitcoin (BTC) and he always has something to say when his father tweets about the leading crypto asset.On Sunday morning (ET), when his Father tweeted a reply to a Zerohedge article about inflation, Spencer wrote: “Better get yourself some sats,” in reply to his Dad’s tweet.When Peter wrote a tweet about the Federal Reserve and its Chair Jerome Powell not showing concern about inflation, Spencer replied with a laser eyes picture of his dad and said “join us.”However, when someone told Peter that he raised a smart kid the gold bug wrote:He may be smart, but when it comes to Bitcoin, he’s a complete fool. A few days prior, Peter Schiff tweeted about his other favorite precious metal, silver, while also sharing an article about the subject. His son responded to the tweet, as he often does every few days, with a tweet about bitcoin coming after silver.In another instance, a person was discussing with Spencer how he would likely have more bitcoin if he didn’t listen to his father.“I’m sure I would’ve had more sats had I stopped listening to his bitcoin advice earlier,” Spencer said.When his father shared an article that talked about the beginning or the end of the so-called bitcoin bear market, Spencer replied without reading the article. “I’ll go out on a limb and bet you think it’s the beginning,” his son remarked.Let’s just say, similar to Peter Schiff’s constant tweets about how much he dislikes bitcoin, Spencer tweets back at his dad just as much.“If [Microstrategy’s] Michael Saylor is correct that the higher the bitcoin price rises the less risky it is to buy, then it must also be true that the lower the bitcoin price falls the riskier it is to own. That’s an extremely dangerous characteristic for an asset to have during a bear market,” Peter wrote on April 22 tagging the Microstrategy CEO.Like clockwork, a few hours later, Spencer Schiff gave his father an amusing response, and oftentimes Spencer gets a lot more likes and retweets.Spencer replied:Do you need a reminder that bitcoin has appreciated 600% in the past year? Peter Schiff and his son Spencer seem to have a solid and fun-loving relationship, and everything said is mostly an attack against BTC or gold. The gold bug has been against bitcoin for a very long time and it doesn’t seem like he will be convinced any time soon, even by his own son.Bitcoiners have formed an alliance with Spencer Schiff to a degree, as they know he is quick to respond to one of his father’s anti-bitcoin tweets. Despite the disagreements about bitcoin, both Spencer and Peter are free-market advocates and both have followed Irwin’s libertarian ideals.What do you think about Peter and Spencer Schiff’s bitcoin relationship? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

1009,"Bitcoin Miners Start Signaling for Taproot Activation, People Prep for BTC's Largest Update in 4 Years","May 3, 2021","Bitcoin miners have started to signal for Taproot activation and crypto supporters are looking forward to the largest bitcoin update in almost four years. The mining operation Slush Pool mined the first block signaling for Taproot and since then the pools Foundry and F2pool have joined in on signaling as well. It’s been a long time since the Bitcoin network has seen a major upgrade and the last time it happened was in 2017, back when BTC participants activated Segregated Witness (Segwit). Since then, bitcoiners have been discussing the next major upgrade Taproot. The Taproot proposal was introduced in January 2018 by software developer and Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell.Last October, Taproot was introduced into the Github repository as a pull request initiated by Bitcoin Core programmer Pieter Wuille. Ostensibly, Taproot can help BTC scale and bitcoin transactions can become more private. The protocol that will be deployed if it comes to consensus, is a soft fork that improves the blockchain’s scripts for privacy-centric and complex transactions.“Taproot is a proposed Bitcoin protocol upgrade that can be deployed as a forward-compatible soft fork,” the Github “Taproot-Activation” documentation notes. “By combining the Schnorr signature scheme with MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Tree) and a new scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot will expand Bitcoin’s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy by letting users mask complex smart contracts as a regular bitcoin transaction.”Following the traditional rules, in order for the Taproot activation to happen, miners need to adopt the new consensus rules by a certain period of time. At the time of writing, more than a dozen blocks have been mined with blocks signaling for the activation of Taproot. The three distinct pools known as F2pool, Foundry, and Slush Pool have all started signaling. F2pool is currently the largest mining pool by hashrate on the BTC network, as far as hash distribution is concerned.While a great number of BTC supporters are positive about Taproot activation, how to upgrade BTC has already come with controversy. In mid-April Bitcoin.com News reported on software developer Luke Dashjr and his angst against miners upgrading with the “Speedy trial” activation method. In a post six days ago, Gregory Maxwell otherwise known as “nullc” on Reddit, got into a heated debate in a thread called “Taproot activation status.”It’s been a while since Bitcoin (BTC) has upgraded and per usual, people are skeptical about blockchain participants coming to consensus following the Segwit2x battles in 2017. The stubbornness and length of time have led people to talk about things like ossification, bitrot, and bitcreep. Moreover, at the end of 2020 Blockchair’s lead developer, Nikita Zhavoronkov ferociously criticized Taproot on Twitter.Despite some disagreements, many people think that coming to consensus over Taproot and even with the debatable activation methods, the upgrade will happen this year. Krakenfx Editor Pete Rizzo recently wrote a comprehensive Twitter thread about the Taproot consensus subject after doing a Clubhouse event in March.“Yes, there are differences in opinion. No, this does not resemble debates that have led to past network splits,” Rizzo said.As of Sunday, May 2, 2021, around 25% of the network’s SHA256 hashrate approves of the Taproot activation. There is a signaling period of 2,016 blocks and “1,802 Taproot blocks left until [the] soft fork is locked in,” the web portal taproot.watch says. “Taproot will not lock in with the current signaling ratio (7.14%),” the page adds.What do you think about the Bitcoin network upgrading?
